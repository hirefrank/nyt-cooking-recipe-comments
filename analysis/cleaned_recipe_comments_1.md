- **Comment Body:** I cannot comment of the taste of the sauce. It was cooling and I ran a short errand. In the meantime, my 8 year old Labrador Retriever, Jake, (who had never, ever bothered anything in the kitchen) somehow got the pot off of the cooktop and ate all of the sauce. The worst part was that I had tripled the recipe, so Jake ate 3 pounds of Bolognese sauce! I am certain he would rate the sauce a 5. We had to go out for dinner, but I will make the recipe again and post relevant feedback!PS Jake is fine.

- **Comment Body:** This was a great and helpful guide. Added a few bits more here, reduced a few things there and ended up with a great bolognese. I have to laugh at the people who are complaining about it not being good. You're saying that you had something on your stove top for 3 hours and not once did you taste it? This is cooking not baking. You taste everything at every step along the way and make adjustments. It is the lazy cook that blames the recipe

- **Comment Body:** I've been making this sauce for 25 years.    It comes out great every time.   I can say that it works with ground beef or a mixture of beef, pork and/or veal.    I can also say that this sauce is 97.32% as good after 1 hour as it is after 3 hours, so if you're impatient.    Noting that it takes about 1 hour to get to step 4, so if you started cooking a bit late, when you get to step 4, you can eat it with minimal reduction in quality after one hour of cooking.

- **Comment Body:** I have the 1979 version of the book. The proportions of ingredients in my cookbook are very different.For 3/4 lb of beef, go with:3 tbs each - olive oil and butter2 tbs each chopped onion, celery and carrot1/2 c milk2 c canned Italian tomatoes, roughly chopped.My recipe calls for adding the wine and cooking off, before adding the milk.I always make a triple or quadruple recipe.  I cut down on the amount of butter/oil I use - never more than 4-6 tbs of each.  It freezes well.

Do what she says—EXACTLY. 2.	Tell Alexa to play Puccini or Verdi 3.	Use the heavy bottom pot. 4.	Do NOTHING to make any step happen more quickly. 7.	Don’t deviate from her instructions. You will have a different result. Tanti saluti.

- **User Display Name:** Brian T Hunt
- **Comment Body:** Authentic. Using a broad, flat noodle such as parpadelle is essential. Chop the vegetables pretty fine- they seem to disappear, but are actually part of the chunks in the ragu. The tip about using a little butter and a little starchy pasta water to toss the sauce with the pasta is also important. And spring for the real Parmesan-Reggiano- desecrating a five-hour ragu with stuff from the green can would not only be disastrously counter-productive and sad, but borderline immoral. :)

- **Comment Body:** This the the best Bolognese recipe there is in my opinion. Btw... Ground chuck is 80/20 ground beef. That is also known as 80%. Any leaner beef and the sauce would not be correct. We do not find it too fatty in the least. You need the butter and whole milk for this sauce to be the way it is supposed to be. Using turkey and skim milk might give you a tasty end result, but it is not Marcella's sauce. As far as I am concerned this recipe is perfect as written . No changes necessary.

I wonder how many of the complainers bothered with the nutmeg...it is the most defining flavor in a true Bolognese sauce, which this most definitely is

The difference in the taste when you cook it for 3 hours (more bland) and 5 hours is incredible and well worth the time.  It ends up being a thick, concentrated sauce that you don't pour on top of the pasta but that you toss into the pasta.

I imagine there are as many variations as there are kitchens in Bologna, folks. If I could add anything to the conversation, it would be to throw a little starchy pasta water in with the sauce and pasta as they are being tossed together, and really bring it all together.

- **Comment Body:** No; it's just a signal that it's finished cooking ("ready to eat"). When sauce cooks long enough that the fat separates it 1) improves the taste of the ingredients, and 2) improves the appearance of the dish. Separated fat looks and tastes beautiful in a dish--it often takes on the deepest colors and flavors in the pot, and is one measure that separates an amateur's dish from a professional's. So, yes! The fat is meant to stay in the pot!

- **Comment Body:** I've made this sauce many times, and I like it for what it is.  I love to doctor things, too, but sometimes a classic is a classic.  That being said, I would add two observations:-Fresh, blanched, peeled, and chopped tomatoes work well, too.  Lean toward longer cooking time.  Haven't needed to add water when using fresh.-I finely mince the vegetables, particularly the carrot and celery.  Otherwise, it has a "beef stew" appearance that my family finds less appealing.

- **Comment Body:** The best suggestion is to not use low-fat meat. It's a meat sauce and thus the meat is the most critical component. The fat reacts with the milk and the wine -- reducing the fat content reduces the ability for the chemical reactions to happen.This recipe is all about the fat and the reactions with the acidity of the tomatoes, the alcohol in the wine and the sugars in the vegetables along with the enzymes in the milk.

This one is a regular around our house;  occasionally instead of ground pork I will use Italian sausage removed form its casing for added flavor.  So, between Marcella and Julia, I turned out to be a pretty good cook, and now with NYTimes Cooking I am still learning and improving.

- **Comment Body:** Delicious - here are my tips: doubled recipe (cooks down a lot), used 1.5 lbs of beef/pork/veal blend, used 2 28 oz cans of plum tomatos, chopped up (closer to 4 cups) and also threw in the juice from one can. I discarded the juice from the other.  This was the perfect amount for some extra flavor. I cooked for 5.5 hours - this sauce REALLY needed time. I left a lot of time between each layer (milk, wine, tomatoes) - upwards of 30 min each. It looked weird until about 4 hours in. So perfect!

- **Comment Body:** wanted to add something to my review from a couple days ago.  My observation is that something magic happens after hour 4 of the final cooking phase.  That's when the flavors deepen.  You taste it a couple hours earlier, and you think, "ok, but I don't see what all the fuss is about." However, after hour 4 is when you taste it and you don't really have words, just sounds to describe it.  Your knees might even buckle a little.

- **Comment Body:** You should add only enough water to keep the sauce from sticking to the bottom of the pot-- no more than 1/2 cup at a time. It's important to pour the water down the side of the pot so that it does not toughen the meat. Continue stirring occasionally and only add more water if the sauce is about to stick. Be sure that by the time you finish cooking the sauce, all the water has evaporated.

There is one thing that is absolutely essential to making this sauce come alive, however.  Marcella tells us in her book to be careful not to over-brown the meat.  Cook it just until it begins to lose its pink color.  Any further, and the sauce will taste like ashes flavored with tomato. I know.  I have made that mistake!

Today, I felt inspired by Kenji's (The Food Lab) bolognese recipe and made a slight change - after adding the tomatoes, I put my dutch oven directly in the oven (preheated to 300F) and let it simmer uncovered for 3 hours. It was INCREDIBLE - even better than Hazan's original recipe (if I dare say so), with a more complex, rich flavor.

It is a beautiful sauce -- mellow from the milk and rich and complex from the combination of nutmeg, tomatoes and wine.  I recommend using it in Marcella's lasagna (also in her original cookbook) that combines tHe Bolognese sauce with bechamel.  Also freezes well.

- **Comment Body:** "Salsa alla bolognese" is Italian for Bolognese sauce—the literal translation of 'salsa' is sauce, in both Italian and Spanish. I think Anne was just pointing out that for a sauce to be considered a Bolognese, it doesn't have basil, thyme, and rosemary. Bolognese is meant to be mildly flavored, rich meat sauce. The inclusion of basil and other herbs is more in line with Southern Italian (and Italian American) cooking.

- **Comment Body:** This is a rich sauce, no question. I have never tried it with 80% beef, but I can see that with so high a fat content the result might be greasy. (I have made it successfully with turkey and non-fat milk.) You might chill the sauce and remove the hardened fat. But it is also true that American spaghetti sauce is usually spooned on very generously, while this sauce is meant to be used more sparingly: the noodles should show under a coating of sauce, like varnish rather than paint.

The richness of the fatty flavor in the whole milk/creme is necessary, and it also seems to help it bind to the pasta.  It tasted fine without, but it wasn't the same...  Also, feel free to pour as much wine in as you like.  I usually put in half a bottle or a bit more depending on how dry the white is.  Then drink the rest.

- **Comment Body:** I made this a few years ago for friends who brought their young son to dinner. They explained ahead of time that he had rather picky eating habits, but loved Italian food. After his first bite, he raised his glass of milk (he was 10) and said "A toast to the chef for this fabulous meal!" It's a winner for all ages and guests!

- **Comment Body:** I have the 1979 version of the book. The proportions of ingredients in my cookbook are very different.For 3/4 lb of beef, go with:3 tbs each - olive oil and butter2 tbs each chopped onion, celery and carrot1/2 c milk2 c canned Italian tomatoes, roughly chopped.My recipe calls for adding the wine and cooking off, before adding the milk.I always make a triple or quadruple recipe. I cut down on the amount of butter/oil I use - never more than 4-6 tbs of each. It freezes well.

- **Comment Body:** It basically means to let the milk (or anything that is supposed to bubble or simmer away) evaporate. You would like to be able to run your spoon through the center of the pot--from one side to the next--and not encounter still more milk... once that happens, you move on to the next liquid. Hope that helps a bit!

For the love of god, don’t freelance or second-guess this recipe. don’t use low-fat ground beef or ground turkey. Don’t make it with low-fat milk or ersatz “milk” made from nuts. Don’t throw in garlic or any other random stuff. Don’t skimp on the cook time. If your stove can’t manage a super-low simmer, try one of those flame reducer things.   FOLLOW THE RECIPE.

- **Comment Body:** "No butter!" "No milk!"?  Please.  We should all know by now Italian cooking has lots of internal variation (by region and by mamma).  This one is close to that of the 'Accademia Italiana della Cucina" (with butter and milk) while the Cucchiaio d'Argento  calls for none of that.  A simple search for "ragù alla bolognese latte" comes up with lots of Italian sources using this ingredient.  Make it with pork, or without, or with whatever strikes you as Italian.  Probably, someone in Italy does too.

Caution: it takes quite a while to cook--waiting for the milk to evaporate, then the wine, then the three hours of tomato cook-down. I doubled it and it fed seven hungry people, and that's all. Served with salad and bread. Worth the time, and it's not hard at all, just time-consuming.

Actually, Marcella Hazan, Italian born in 1924 was a cooking writer.  Much as Julia Childs introduced home cooks to French cooking, she did for Italian traditional cooking. A leading authority on the topic.  I understand you didn't like the recipe.  But thought you needed to know something about her.

Official "Bolognese" is strictly limited to the ingredients used in Marcella's recipe.  No garlic or herbs are permitted.  So, technically speaking, if you add anything else, it's not true "Bolognese".  Of course, "La polizia di cibo Italia" will likely not invade your kitchen if you add whatever makes you happy, LOL.

You'll stir it up to coat the sauce with a little bit of fat, then toss with the starchy pasta, and this will help the sauce adhere to the pasta.

- **Comment Body:** When you add the milk or wine, there is already liquid in the pan that is a combination of fat and some water. Water evaporates and (pure) fat does not. Pay attention to the amount of liquid in your meat before adding the milk or wine. The milk or wine have cooked away when you are left with about the same liquid as before you added them.

As others have said: If this takes you less than 5 hours, yeah, you're doing it wrong. Milk and wine steps alone took over an hour. Slow and low (heat) after that. Taste for seasoning towards the end, as the sauce cooks down; flavors get super concentrated and you don't want to wind up overly salting. And DO add butter to the pasta. You came this far - indulge! SO worth it.

I was sad to find my 1983 reprint of The Classic Italian failed to include a hand written note dating my maiden voyage with the recipe. This Bolognese never fails. Part of my enjoyment lies in the pleasure of the sauce silently simmering for hours on the cook top. The anticipation of what lies ahead is fantastic. As an aside, I always use fresh Romas and homemade pasta... and a nice Vino Nobile. Buon Appetito!

- **Comment Body:** Low, even heat and patience is key. If using gas, you need a large and heavy vessel. Letting the added liquid bubble away should involve some stirring, until the free liquid has reduced into the sauce."The laziest of simmers" can be hard to achieve, since pots are too small, don't spread heat and so heat the sauce too much, breaking it.An enameled cast iron pot that seems too large works well. A heat diffuser might help.

- **Comment Body:** Butter?! Nonsense. Like so many Hazan recipes, it makes this dubiously "italian". No butter! No "vegetable oil", use olive oil. The recipe calls for too much tomato, consider cutting back. Add some pancetta before the bulk of the meat. Instead of ground beef, try a medium cut of beef and hand-chop. If ground, use a coarse grind. (Frankly, I can't understand the fascination with Hazan's recipes and even less why people feel they are italian. They are far from authentic italian recipes.)

- **User Display Name:** Janet
- **Comment Body:** I have made Marcella Hazan’s Bolognese sauce for years -  it is always fantastically delicious. However, this NYT adaptation reverses the order in which the milk and wine are added. The wine needs to be added first so it can reduce and flavor the meat. The milk should be added after the wine since it does not reduce fully. This is fine because it helps the sauce retain moisture. If the wine is added after the milk, the wine never fully reduces which negatively affects the flavor of the sauce.

However, if I'm serving it immediately, I just stir the fat through and serve.That's because sometimes a lil fat in food makes me happier;).Like others, I make enough to last for several meals and it's fantastic in lasagna.

Simmer is very gentle and perfect without worry of burning sauce on bottom. I like to make four times this recipe and I freeze the remains. To cut down on cooking I will reduce the wine prior to adding.  Before I start cooking onions, I add tomatoes in crock to heat up.  After I cook off the wine, I add meat mixture to crock pot for at least three hours as, per recipe

Ms Hazan, in her original recipe, says that the sauce should look like jam when finished: a concentration of flavours from the long, slow cooking.  I think her quantities are a bit skimpy but I always cook for more than one meal and freeze the remainder, and never reheat in a microwave on account of somewhere in heaven she may be watching.

It cooks down quite a bit. For the milk, I cooked for about 40 min - just until it wasn't really "milky". For the wine, same time - really just until when I put my head over the pot, it didn't have that strong boozy smell.  My sauce was always a tad "greasy" too, but not in a bad way.

- **Comment Body:** This echoes everyone who reviewed this as delicious. It is.  It's amazing to me how such simple ingredients can transform into this intensely flavorful experience. So incredibly satisfying.  I thought I would add this note for those who might be cooking for a crowd.  I fed 12 at Christmas, and I made double batches of this over the course of 3 weekends, freezing the first two and then the third right before,  A double batch, at least in my kitchen, takes at least 7 hours from start to finish.

- **Comment Body:** I tried it just as described. Very good. The ingredient list is perfect.  I prefer heavy cream at the end of the sauce cooking process to the milk early on. AND...and this is a big and...the three hour simmering is unnecessary.  Cooking at a higher heat in a good pan and making sure it doesn't stick or burn actually achieves a more flavorful sauce in less than an hour. A tablespoon of sugar to neutralize the acidity in the wine and tomatoes goes a long way as well.

Most notable, the milk and wine steps: really cook until completely evaporated. Makes such a difference in the depth of the final sauce. Both the milk and wine took at least 20 minutes, respectively. Patience pays off!

- **Comment Body:** Amazing recipe! Leftover idea: I doubled the recipe and let it simmer for a long while, making the sauce more of a paste which I used to make Bolognese Flatbread. I used an herbed foccacia as the base, spread the bolognese, the put a layer of sauteed shallot and sweet pepper, and baked in the oven for 20 min. I topped it with crumbled feta, shaved carrots, and fresh parsley. Delicious!

- **Comment Body:** Have it simmering the last hour now, used rainbow heirloom carrots and 2% because it’s what I had in hand. But used 1/3 pork a little heavy on the fat so I think I’m ok with the lower milk fat. I def had to let the milk and wine go about 45 min each until I felt they were evaporated, hope it wasn’t too long.  Just snuck a taste and it’s amazing. Roasted some garlic heads for crusty bread and a spinach salad and dinner is good to go. And the house smells amazing.

- **Comment Body:** With deep respect for Marcella Hazan, I took another approach to Bolognese this evening. Facing a fourth night of leftover chuck roast, I chopped that last chunk of meat into tiny cubes, with the well cooked carrots and onion. Into the pot for the milk and wine routine. Added beef bouillon, water, black pepper and a glob of tomato paste.  Simmered another 30 minutes. It did lack the depth that comes from long simmering, but made excellent leftovers. I think Marcella would have understood.

- **Comment Body:** If you’re looking for an Italian-American tomato sauce, don’t make this. It’s a rich earthly meat sauce, light on tomatoes—the carrot, milk and nutmeg give it a unique flavor. Cook the onions very slowly to impart sweetness. If you want more sauce, double the recipe. I’ve made this for 20 years; you can skip the pasta and serve it over thick slices of garlic bread or triangles of polenta. You can speed up the cook time by touching it up with a hand immersion blender, to give it a silky texture.

It is the best sauce ever.  I always double the recipe:  use 4 tbs butter and 1 tbs oil; add extra ground beef, 2-2 1/2 pounds; double the tomatoes to two 28 oz cans of plum tomatoes then break up with hands into little pieces and toss into the sauce pan with their juice. Simmer for at least 3 hours -- 5-6 hrs. best. Taste along way and add salt

- **Comment Body:** i have made this delightful dish many times and to me it is a courtship of tomato and beef, thus it is important to use the finest ground beef(beefy tasting) and the best canned tomatoes, ones  that are deep in flavor, slightly acidic and sweet. When cooking the ground beef be sure to take the time to cook away all the liquid it gives off as this liquid can impart an off taste.It's best with homemade pasta

Never add basil or garlic or whatever else you're thinking it needs. Don't leave out the butter. One commenter wrote that Marcella Hazan did not know how to cook Italian and butter is never used in Italian cuisine. Both ridiculous statements. Follow the recipe, don't discard the fat, mix it in. You won't be disappointed!

THIS is the bolognese I always crave - it's not just some ground beef in a puddle of tomato sauce.  The recipe is deceptively simple, but the meat was incredibly tender, the sauce layered, deep and flavorful. Resist the urge to add garlic or herbs or other "stuff" - your patience and trust in Marcella will be rewarded!

- **Comment Body:** I've tried several recipes, and this is the best, and the simplest. Coincidence? This is the first time that I feel like I understand what a Bolognese is supposed to be: a meat SAUCE. A couple of notes: First, I like to chop the mirepoix super finally to to make it more of a sauce than a stew or ragú. Second, and for the same reason, make sure to simmer for at least three hours. Third, make the day ahead: the flavors meld, the fat is easier to skim. Fourth, I add a dash of soy sauce or depth.

- **Comment Body:** This is time intensive overall, but the prep takes less than an hour. I multiply the recipe by 4 times which gives us plenty to freeze for later or to give to friends. This makes the effort so much easier. These days I used cans of diced tomatoes and I buy short celery stick packages and already diced carrots. With regard to onions, carrots, and celery, I usually add more than the recipe calls for. For the beef, I like to use the grass-fed type.

- **Comment Body:** Forgive me if this is an unpopular review (and please, no food shaming me) but I found this bland and not at all what I was expecting. I have had Bolognese in Italian restaurants and was fully expecting the bits of carrot and celery - that’s what makes it so delicious! However this dish lacked the acidity and depth of flavor that I have gotten from more I guess Americanized versions of bolognese. So my advice here is if you’re looking for more of a tomato sauce base, this recipe is not for you.

- **Comment Body:** For years I made bolognese without any milk and never understood why I could not achieve that creamy velvety quality you find in the best bolognese sauces. It's the MILK! It breaks down the fat in the meat and the particles of meat become softer and smaller, producing the velvety quality in the sauce. So, yes, this is a great recipe! Thank you Marcella.

- **Comment Body:** My tips (from SeriousEats) Careful adding the milk unless you’ve transitioned the mixture to low heat and let it cool slightly, otherwise the milk will break.  Instead of simmering on the stovetop, I put my Dutch oven in the oven on 300-325. This allowed the top to brown, and I intermittently scraped the caramelization around the edges into the sauce to enhance flavor.  At the end I gradually added fish sauce to taste! No more than a tbsp. Doesn’t taste fishy, but enhances the umami! Trust me :)

Sometimes I use .5 beef to .5 ground Italian sausage from my butcher; once I used ground pork w/fennel. Taste along the way to check salt. My biggest hack? Cook for three hours, rest till room temp, then FREEZE IT. When you reheat weeks later... WOW. I pull it out the morning before my kids come home from college. A big pot of bolognese on the stove when they walk in? Big win.

So I separated the stems from the leaves, I finely chopped the stems and subbed them in for the celery.  20 minutes before serving I added the roughly torn leaves. It was incredible, if anyone else happens to be looking for a way to use up their produce.

I freeze in small containers for later as it is a very rich sauce and when I'm craving it. I like Angel hair pasta (small amount)-I like softer and smaller textures now when eating. I accidentally over cooked a batch till it was in the very reduced "roasted" stage and that was one of the most tasteful accidents, ever. High high-praise for this Recipe. It give me joy each time.

- **Comment Body:** In St. Louis, you often hear of people making Bolognese using combinations of salsiccia (sweet or hot) with ground pork and veal in roughly equal amounts instead of beef, with crushed whole tomatoes and five or six cloves of chopped garlic added after the milk has reduced. Another variant is use of white vermouth instead of white wine. The secret is very slow cooking in the oven at low temperature.

- **Comment Body:** This is a classic central to northern Italian Bolognese.  If you're used to garlic and more intense flavors of the southern Italian and American Italian sauces and meats, you'll think this is bland.   But it's how it is in Italy.   And frequently in the Emilia-Romagna, Le Marche, and Abruzzo areas they use a very light hand with garlic, and keep it separate from onions.  The soffritto (carrots/celery/onions) without garlic is a classic sauce base of these centro regions.

And how does one know when wine has "evaporated"? I probably let it bubble for a minute or two. And I am worried about the end where the "fat must separate from the sauce." Should the fat be removed or stirred back into the sauce? Thanks.

But I do respect my elders and when the great Hazan herself recommended a long simmer, I obliged. Including you lovely folks recommending five plus hours. I’m so delighted I persevered. The results are deliciousness, homey, comfort food, love in a dish!  I left the lid off, stirred every 6 mins for 5 hours on low.  I hope this helps.

I double the ingredients to serve eight guests and there are never any leftovers. Be patient and follow the recipe to a T, you will not be disappointed. If you are adventuresome, use the use to make a very savory lasagna. Outstanding.

The other variations are (depending on # of servings desired) to add 3 + cloves of garlic chopped fine and a teaspoon of red pepper flakes and to finish flavoring with a sprinkling of fresh thyme leaves.

- **Comment Body:** This is great, though I also like adding in finely chopped dried porcinis, which gives another complex meaty flavor.  I have also tried similar recipes that include some beef stock - a bit different, but also good.  One trick I love is to simmer it in slow cooker on low OVERNIGHT instead.  If on low, letting it go for 7 hours is not too long. Then, the flavors can meld the whole next day in the fridge before you eat it for dinner, which makes it even better.

I must comment that the technique in a Bolognese is to let each layer of liquid evaporate before adding the next. First the milk and then the wine.

Could go more gently when also feeding kids.    Terrific family recipe. Also good for date night at home. How many pasta recipes do you have that don’t include garlic?    It’s a keeper!

Wine, milk and nutmeg are required,  and my only addition is to add a good handful of soaked dried porcini with the hot water they are soaked in.  It adds another layer without screwing up a classic.  A Milanese trick I sometimes use when I can get one is to slip a veal bone in for the cooking.  It ups the richness quotient.

Overall, it was a success.

- **Comment Body:** I was taught wine first, but a few other things slightly different too. First, finely dice the veggies to a saffrite. Sweat the veggies in butter, oil and salt for 20 minutes over low heat then remove from pan. Turn heat to high and brown your meat 1/3 at a time. (Adding all the meat leads to boiling it instead of browning). Use the wine to deglaze the caramelized pan. Add veggies with milk and San Marzano tomatoes back into meat.

- **Comment Body:** I am way behind the bandwagon on this recipe as I just made it today. And wow. It. Is. Amazing. 5 hours of lazy simmering, I did not have whole milk so mixed 2 percent with half and half. That was my only deviation. It made my house smell as delicious as it tasted.

- **Comment Body:** Made this beautiful sauce today straight from Marcella’s cookbook. Was thankful for some of the comments here that it takes a LONG time to simmer out the liquids. I did double the recipe but it took at least an hour each at a strong simmer to let most of the milk/wine evaporate. I’d estimate 3 hours of prep/active cooking before the slow simmer stage. I simmered it for about 4 hours which I definitely recommend. Tossed with homemade tagliatelle and it was EXCELLENT. Very worth the 7 hours!

The quantities of each ingredient are less important than the process -for example, I like a bit more tomato sauce in mine- but follow the process exactly and you can't go wrong.

- **Comment Body:** I made this in the Dutch oven and it really helped prevent sticking and came together nicely. This was so incredibly tasty, it truly is the best bolognese! My only substitutions was adding a whole pound of beef instead of 3/4th a pound (since it comes in a lb) and then I add extra veggies so I don’t toss any. So like the whole carrot and celery stalk even if it’s a little extra. I’m down with getting my extra veggies in.

I started it late in the day; got to a point where I needed to add a 1/2 cup of water, and placed it overnight in the crock pot on low. The next morning I had the most perfect pot of Bolognese. The lasagne into which it was incorporated was the best I ever made. I doubled the recipe so, yes, the milk took over an hour to evaporate, and the wine about 45 minutes.

For the love of the kitchen gods, can one of the NYT's food experts adapt this recipe in a way that makes sense for shopping at today's grocery? Start with the tomatoes and just make it a 28 ounce can already. And make that a full pound of beef please. Who wants to use 3/4 lb of beef and then make a burger with the leftovers?

It was delicious, but before I made the sacrilegious modfications, it just seemed to be like a pile of onions, carrots, celery, hamburger meat with a few pieces of chopped tomatoes floating around.  The proportion of tomatoes and the other ingredients seemed off.  Nothing like what I get when I order Bolognese sauce in a restaurant. What did I do wrong?

- **Comment Body:** To Ellen: I've made it several times (and am making it right now). It takes quite a while for the milk liquids to evaporate and then for the wine to evaporate (half hour to 45 minutes each). I do it for each until most of the liquid is gone and all you see left is mostly fat, which won't evaporate. I've never understood the "fat separation" bit either, but it always comes out great. I read somewhere else that the simmering milk does something to the meat that tenderizes it.

Add the wine before the dairy. 6 Add some truly fresh ricotta for the last 30 seconds in the skillet of pasta+sauce and give a quick twirl... leaving threads of creamy ricotta in the pasta when plated. 9.  We add fresh basil and then the grated regianno 10.  DON'T FORGET THE WARM ITALIAN BREAD AND BAROLO!!!!

I took out a pan and heated up some garlic and oil. I added that to the sauce. I also added about 1/4 cup of pasta water to the sauce at the end and put the fire up to high for a few minutes. Before adding the sauce to the pasta, I swirled in some mascarpone cheese. Delicious!!!!

Frankly, I don't like the smell and it takes forever to lazily simmer the milk and wine.

I prepared everything stovetop up until cooking off the wine, but you could probably do it in the Instant Pot on saute if you are used to cooking that way. Then pressure cook on high for 25 minutes and after releasing the steam you can remove the lid and cook until the liquid is reduced.

It is important to do them as instructed because the milk coats the beef so that it doesn't get acidy when you add the tomatoes. This sauce has a wonderful sweet taste (from the carrots). It usually takes me 5 hours, and so worth it.

- **Comment Body:** Made this pretty much exactly to the recipe (I doubled it, and subbed the suggested/permitted 1/3 ground pork to 2/3 ground beef). I did add a couple of bay leaves. The result was unctuously fatty and delicious. Not spicy at all, I suppose you could add some heat if you like that. Took several hours to make but mostly hands off. I measured the vegetables in a smallish dice and then finely chopped in a food processor. It is important to stir, taste, season as you go.

- **Comment Body:** Easy delicious vegan adaption  -ground beef = TJ's Beefless Ground Beef or Beyond Meat -milk = soy milk -parmigiano-reggiano cheese = nutritional yeast  Even the meat eaters in our family could not tell and went back for seconds!  Definitely adding this to our rotation.

- **Comment Body:** Marcella’s Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking DOES NOT say add the wine before the milk, contrary to Kevin’s comment. It explicitly says to “[c]ook the meat in milk BEFORE adding wine and tomatoes to protect it from the acidic bite of the latter.” (my emphasis) That makes sense chemically. Also don’t forget to add salt when first sautéing the meat, because she says that helps extract meat juices, and lean meat will make the ragù less “sweet”.  So just follow this recipe as is.

We're plant-based, so I sub either a plant-based meat substitute like Impossible (if I'm rushed or lazy) or a mix of minced mushrooms and black lentils. I use red wine instead of white wine and two ~14oz. containers of crushed plum tomatoes. It's off-the-chain incredible.

I added garlic, which curiously isn’t in the recipe, and a bit more onion and ground beef than the recipe called for. Stewed for three hours and added water thrice, honestly it can probably stew for 1.5-2 hours and it would be roughly the same, this was amazing.

I have two of Marcella's books this one and The Classic Cookbook....  One of the hardest things I've ever done in following this recipe is not to brown the meat.  I remember years ago when cooking this the first time it was like withdrawal symptoms.  Literally cook only till the pink disappears, you will be rewarded.  In my opinion, best with pappardelle.

- **Comment Body:** Have been making this recipe for years now. I use equal parts chuck, veal, and pork. Remember to let the milk and wine reduce all the way down before proceeding to the next. This takes a significant amount of time on its own. This really tenderizes the meat before adding the tomato component. From beginning to end this recipe typically takes me about 6 hours. Its an all day affair and the result is worth it.

The sweetness could have come from the carrots, but unlikely.  Be careful what kind of white wine you use.  Try it again.  This is a classic prep that you should not fold on the first time around.

I have just seen that this recipe has been reprinted in The Guardian with metric measurements and they are totally different from the conversions I used. I will likely give this one more try (third time lucky?) but I’m not yet convinced…

The recipe spells out at each step that you cook until the liquid is evaporated and you're just left with the meat, vegetables, and fat. At the end you should have zero water. Too acidic I would question what wine you used -- a very dry white is best.

- **Comment Body:** This is an exercise in patience - and it pays off! Plan for 5-6 hours as it takes time for milk and wine to reduce. It's worth doubling or tripling the recipe and freezing the leftovers. What a treat - the kind of Bolognese you'd hope for at a good Italian restaurant.  A few notes: Some reviewers said it's bland, but I found it just needed more salt at the end after the sauce reduced. I followed the recipe exactly except I doubled it and added 2 bay leafs, which added a little something.

- **Comment Body:** I imagine that this way of preparing Bolognese is special, and delicious, but being completely allergic to white wine (and, to tell the truth, being Italian and a little too close to family tradition), I use red wine. Carrots are absolutely essential, and are part of the traditional Bolognese recipe (from centuries ago, proudly preserved by the Bolognese). But, in addition, the carrot reduces the acidity of the tomato and meat, which is commendable.

Nothing to do with what we cook in Italy, vegetables and minced meat (1/3 beef,1/3 veal, 1/3 pork) has to be cooked separately till they brown to have Maillard's reaction well done. Then you join all, if you like to add wine add it to the meat and let it evaporate all. Then you add triple concentrated tomato paste, stir well and cook. At this moment you will add milk and two leaves of bay and some rosemary well tied together (bouquet garni). Let it sips slowly for 2/3 h.

But on a cold, uneventful winter Sunday I cooked it exactly according to the recipe - except substituting some cream for milk because I only had low fat on hand. And wow!  Very smooth, most authentic Bolognese I have ever tasted outside of Italy. You can trust my judgment: I grew up in Italy. I doubled the amounts, so there‘ll be plenty to freeze and enjoy some other time.

- **Comment Body:** A helpful tip: When a sauce requires lengthy cooking to become dense, I put a heat diffuser under the pot just like my Italian mother-in-law taught me. It distributes the heat evenly across the bottom of the pot and vastly lowers the chances of the sauce sticking and burning. Diffusers are not expensive and can be used with either electric or gas burners.  Also, pouring added water down the sides of the pot helps heat the water so it doesn't slow cooking and speeds it where needed at the bottom.

This also help reduce the amount of butter so use 1 tbsp EVOO and 1 tbsp butter with the bacon.  I used a pecan wood smoked bacon.BE PATIENT! GAS STOVE: Reducing time for milk 30 min, wine was 25 min.  Not too much fat at the end to remove which is exactly how its supposed to be - thick rich and hearty!  Will serve with Trader Joes Pappardelle pasta!

- **Comment Body:** Solid recipe.  I modify a bit by using 1 part each of pork and veal to 2 parts beef.  I use a shredder for the carrots, celery and onion and add mushrooms for earthiness.  I then cook it down like a would duxelles mushrooms before browning the meat separately then combining.  Good San Marizano tomatoes and some (a few tablespoons) of good tomatoes paste.  Milk is essentially as is the nutmeg.  I also simmer a few garlic cloves whole and a bayleaf then remove.  Not classic I know but works!

- **Comment Body:** Lots of work - one can't completely leave this alone on the stove because of all the evaporating and allowing to bubble up completely (milk and wine). But well worth it! I more than doubled the recipe and cooked this while preparing meals on Saturday, then let it simmer two hours more on Sunday morning before freezing 2/3.

- **Comment Body:** I do a portion of ground pork, and skim off part of the fat after the sauce cools.  While it does take a while to make, I wouldn't shorten the cooking time if you can help it.  It develops the depth of flavors that makes this simple recipe so special.  This recipe freezes really well so I would definitely at least double it! It works well on pasta, polenta, lasagna, or in a bowl with a spoon!

- **Comment Body:** Important remark:  Between Step 1 and 2 you have to clear the pan. Put the content of Step 1 aside and broil/fry the minced beef/pork under high heat. Remove obsolete water - if occurs  (depends on the consistence/quality of the meat). Do not put to much meat in one pan load as there must be enough heat to remove the moisture. After this put everything in on pan again an follow instructions.

- **Comment Body:** I have the 1979 version of the book. The proportions of ingredients in my cookbook are very different.  For 3/4 lb of beef, go with: 3 tbs each - olive oil and butter 2 tbs each chopped onion, celery and carrot 1/2 c milk 2 c canned Italian tomatoes, roughly chopped.  My recipe calls for adding the wine and cooking off, before adding the milk.  I always make a triple or quadruple recipe. I cut down on the amount of butter/oil I use - never more than 4-6 tbs of each. It freezes well.

The 1st time the sauce was so cooked down (even though I continually checked & added a little water) it just seemed brown & bland. The 2nd time, I used 1/2 can of tomato paste and diluted with water. It gave the sauce more color and flavor. I also added a few fennel seeds per friend. Doesn't serve as many as it says. I quadrupled & only served 14.

I also could figure out how to skim the fat off. I ended up getting a spoonfull of the sauce, and tilting it towards the edge of the pan to drain off any fat.   Note: you could probably crock pot this recipe for the final three hours on low if that's easier for any of you.

- **Comment Body:** I read through the notes before cooking this for the first time today. Based on them, I added two bay leaves, about 1/4 cup of tomato paste, and a 2"-square piece of parm rind. Before serving, I admit to skimming off a lot of the fat; I know that the lusciousness of the grease is part of the attraction of this recipe, but I'm not fond of that mouthfeel. I served it with penne (which was too smooth; a textural short pasta would be better) and a lot of parm-regg. It was quite good.

- **Comment Body:** As a person who cannot consume milk protein, this recipe is delicious even when made with *gasp* a non-dairy substitute for the milk. I've found regular almond milk is too thin and will separate with all the acid from the tomato and wine, so I prefer a single serving (5.3 oz) container of plain, unsweetened almond milk greek yogurt like Kite Hill. It thickens and creams like the whole milk would. That said, if you can consume milk, make the original.

- **Comment Body:** I have made this with beef and with turkey, however, I usually make this with ground turkey (94% lean) to accommodate beef allergies, and it is still excellent. I agree with others that the cooking time will be much longer if you actually wait till each added liquid cooks off completely, but this is well worth doing! Because turkey is so lean, you also cannot skimp on the butter or use anything other than whole milk. That being said, even with turkey, this recipe is outstanding!

Add beef in stages, brown well, cook out moisture between additions.  Brown very deeply w/out burning for 10-15 minutes. ALL the flavor is in this step.  Add wine, then milk. Taste, salt, taste, salt (it needs more salt than you think). Cook super low & stir as needed 3-4 hours. You want as little moisture as possible.  Add parm & butter!

I can't verify that the amounts for this recipe in her book are the same as printed here (My copy of the book is quite old) but since I now live most of the time in France, I depend on using the online version here at NYT. I find the sauce needs at least four hours of slow simmering to incorporate all its flavor. Adding a chiffonade of fresh basil when serving doesn't hurt!

Although the original recipe had the wine added before the milk, I've found adding the milk first is better in terms of ensuring the acid from the wine doesn't toughen the milk. If the milk starts to boil/foam too much, just add another quarter cup of milk.   The longer you can simmer this recipe, the better. One time I made it to six hours and that sauce was divine.

Over time, I began to double and then, triple it and freeze it in three cup portions to thaw for a quick dinner with pasta or to use in myriad recipes that call for meat sauce. So incredibly delicious and the aroma while it's cooking is heavenly- right up there with baking bread, pumpkin pie and roasting a turkey. :)

- **Comment Body:** I've been making this sauce for 25 years. It comes out great every time. I can say that it works with ground beef or a mixture of beef, pork and/or veal. I can also say that this sauce is 97.32% as good after 1 hour as it is after 3 hours, so if you're impatient. Noting that it takes about 1 hour to get to step 4, so if you started cooking a bit late, when you get to step 4, you can eat it with minimal reduction in quality after one hour of cooking.

Our then-teenaged daughter was beyond picky and held anything we made with disdain, only wanting mac and cheese, etc. One weekend when my wife was gone, I spent a good part of a day making this with veal. Served it on fresh pasta with all the freshly grated parmesan our daughter wanted. She ate every bit and did everything but lick the pot. I’d never tried something like this and it was worth every moment.

- **Comment Body:** Great base recipe and can tinker as you like - I added some minced garlic with the onion, some ground sage and much less ground oregano (not much - 1/4-2 tspish) and homemade chicken stock for moisture and used light red instead of white wine.  If you let it sit and slowly reduce, you cannot go wrong with classic Bolognese flavor. There will be a layer of grease (also depends on meat) - removal (partial or full) depends on personal preference.

My early efforts, I was too impatient.   This time around, I allowed the extra time to really let the liquids evaporate before moving on to the recipe's next step. I found it made a world of difference.   I also went much heavier on the salt this last time and that, too, helped make the flavors pop a bit.

Wait for the milk and the wine to evaporate. Dice the veggies very small. Use the proper meat blend. The only thing I changed was I had some mushrooms that needed using up so added those to the veggie dice in the beginning. I salt and peppered as I went and used a dry white wine. It is so delicious I'm planning on eating it on toast for breakfast

- **Comment Body:** 2/2021 Evaporating milk then wine takes 45 minutes + 45 minutes BEFORE the 3 hours of simmering, so the total cooking time is about 5 hours. Adding pasta water is key when combining with pasta. Sauce is barely enough for 12 oz. of egg noodles--no way it would work with a pound or more. This is basic comfort food.

- **Comment Body:** I had all the ingredients on hand so I jumped right in and made this..... and then I noticed the simmer time in step 4.  Well, that wasn't going to happen, but I still probably got in a good hour of simmer time before I could wait no longer. Verdict - delicious, regardless.

Followed other's instructions to not get rid of the fat as it does imbue the sauce with unimaginable flavor! I will never make bolognese any other way moving forward.

- **Comment Body:** The first time I made Hazan's bolognese sauce, I got some freshly ground meat from the local butcher - & imported tomatoes & nutmeg. Hours at a low simmer on the stove had the whole house smelling divine. Then it was time to thin the sauce a bit. There was a mug of water by the stove. As I tossed it into the sauce, I wondered where it came from. And that's when I remembered it was *orchid fertilizer*. Y'all, I cried so hard. A true river of tears accompanied the sauce as it went down the drain

- **Comment Body:** Nothing beats Marcella Hazan's bolognese. NOTHING. I've been making this recipe for years and find that doing half pork and half beef gives me the best flavor. Also a heads up: if you're using a dutch oven, expect to be waiting on the evaporation of the milk and wine for at least 30 minutes respectively. You will be locked to your stove for an hour before the necessary 2-3 of simmering!

- **Comment Body:** I adapted this for my instant pot as follows:  I sautéed the veggies and meat on the sauté setting and boiled down most of the milk and wine also on that setting. I added the tomatoes (and a jar of Passata - personal choice) and set it to the slow cooker setting on medium for the 8 hours I would be at work. When I got home I removed the lid, set the sauté function first to medium and then low and cooked off most of the liquid as you would if cooking traditionally. This worked really well!

I make it in big batches (5 to 7 lbs of meat) and freeze it in 3 cup portions in zip lock bags.  It is so handy to have in the freezer.

- **Comment Body:** I’ve made this once before but didn’t chop the carrot or celery so finely, didn’t leave enough time for the milk to simmer, then the wine to simmer, etc. The result was okay, unremarkable. This time around I gave myself a whole day to make this wonderful, and it’s one of the most crave-able dishes I’ve ever made.  I have a two year old that taste-tested along the way and he called it a “sauce treat”, my husband keeps digging leftovers out of the pot. I added parm rinds as the only modification.

- **Comment Body:** This recipe is definitely worth the hype. The prep for it was easy as can be, and then you simply just wait for it to cook. The waiting time is key; if you rush it, the carrots and celery will not be soft enough, and the flavors will not have fully merged. Overall, I cooked it exactly as is. The only note people should know is that I used a 28 oz. can of tomatoes, and that was the right amount! No need to measure it; just use the whole can (and be sure to chop up the tomatoes yourself!).

- **Comment Body:** I made Marcella's Bolognese a lot back in the day. Don't have the cookbook any more. Found some of your instructions confusing. How to tell when milk has "bubbled away" when it's in a morass of seething butter/oil/meat? Ditto with the white wine?  Mine has been simmering for 3 hours with the tomatoes... and there is no chance that it will begin to "dry out" and what? "fat separates from the meat?" These are not clear descriptions of what happens with these ingredients. Do better.

This is usually made the day before service and left on the stove to rest over night without refrigeration. Just turn the flame OFF and cover.  I know it sounds crazy but the sauce has a chance to rest and it is so much better the next day.

- **Comment Body:** This is incredible. Have made it twice now. If you double the batch, the reductions will take twice as long at least. An extra hour can make the difference between a soupy mess and a rich, sticky sauce. The veg and beef give off a lot of liquid. Can’t be rushed!   My only variation: My toddlers hate onions so I used a food processor to make the mirepoix into almost a paste. Sneaky.

Garlic (powder, no less!), sugar and oregano should not be necessary for great sauce if your use quality ingredients. Marcella Hazan is a renowned cook and recipe author. "Not good enough" is never an accurate score for one of her recipes.

I use an equal blend of ground chuck, veal, and pork, which is more traditional.  It's interesting that she doesn't use garlic or herbs in this, but I won't quibble with the master.  I use 3 cloves and dried thyme in mine, which makes it very tasty.

- **Comment Body:** I tasted as I went, once the bolognese was just down to the hours of occasional stirring and checking for sticking to the pan. All along it had little actual flavor (to my tastebuds) for which I blamed my aversion to accidental over-salting. But I soldiered on - and in the last minutes as I served it, added the copious amounts of fresh parmagiana called for in the recipe, which transformed it to a delicious mound of meaty flavor on top of thin tagliatelle. Got raves.

I used 2% milk because that is what I had in the house, and used 1 cup of wine and 1 cup of beef broth instead of 2 cups of wine (did not have enough wine).  The sauce was delicious.  It took a long time to cook down the milk and then the wine/broth, because I had doubled the recipe (I think it took a total of 2 hours to get to the point of adding the tomatoes).  Superb.

- **Comment Body:** I've made this several times with beyond/impossible meat and it's turned out well. They are (I think) lower fat, or at least the fat that's in there doesn't really separate out. But it tastes good, and freezes well too.

- **Comment Body:** This sure is different from her original version in The Classic Italian Cookbook. I've made this recipe hundreds of times (it's now engraved on my brain), and it calls for 2 tablespoons each of diced carrot, celery, and onion.  One-half cup of milk. 1 cup white wine (I usually use ¾ cup with fine results).  Pepper isn't mentioned. It is the purest, most remarkable Bolognese in existence. And if you order it in a restaurant, ask if the beef is cooked in milk. If not, it's not real Bolognese.

- **Comment Body:** Classic.  I do reduce the ratio of carrot in the mirepoix to avoid too much sweetness.  And I prefer all pork and often add minced chicken livers for earthiness - but you can't go wrong.  This recipe is very receptive to tweaking.

- **Comment Body:** The milk, then the  nutmeg (don't skip it), then the wine. The alcohol dissolves and disperses flavor compounds in the nutmeg that milk does not; best not to evaporate it away before adding the spice.

- **Comment Body:** This is a perfect recipe. If you run out of time (or don’t plan ahead), I’ve found that 20 minutes on high pressure in the Instapot can credibly swap for the 3 hours of stovetop bubbling (swirl in butter at the end, briefly set to sauté if liquid ratio too high).

- **Comment Body:** So delicious tossed with pappardelle and topped with fresh parm-reggiano, a definite keeper! I doubled the recipe and used a mix of chuck/pork/veal. The large 28oz can of San Marzano tomatoes was perfect for the double recipe. Sacrilege, I added a couple cloves of minced garlic to the veggies, NOT sorry, yum. Took a good 40 minutes to simmer off the milk and another 40 to simmer off the (good, dry) white wine. Well worth the time to slowly simmer to perfection, thank you Marcella.

- **Comment Body:** I had no idea how hot my gas stove runs until my “laziest of simmers,” even after an hour all the way on low, still had little channels of constant bubbling. Eventually I stacked the grate from the other side of the stove onto top of the grate I was using, doubling the distance from the heat. MUCH better.   At 1 hour’s simmer sauce was great; at 2 hours’, too sweet (added pepper and a little salt); at 3 hours, perfect-tasting and texturally smooth.

I followed the recipe to the letter and I tried to doctor it up as we were having a dinner guest.  It was so bland...I added chopped fresh basil and some red pepper flakes to try to boost the flavor.  And then there's the grease!  It was so gross I just had to drain part of it off...unbelievable.  Needless to say, 20,000+ people don't agree with me,

Added a little extra umami with a tablespoon of porcini powder when adding the meat. I did 2:1:1 beef:pork:veal. Texture and as fantastic and so was the richness. Also don’t skip on using the best pasta you can find.

The only additions/deviations I made were to season with kosher salt and fresh pepper at every stage, added a fair amount of garlic, and added 1/2 cup of reserved pasta water when I tossed the sauce with the pasta.   Really special. I wish I had tripled it so I had batches to freeze.

- **Comment Body:** New to cooking or not, be aware that this is a meat sauce, not a tomato sauce. It is not meant to be liquidy. The sauce should coat the pasta meagerly. It's not "spaghetti sauce" as many Americans think of it. The recipe states that, at the end, no water should be left. That goes for the tomato juices as well. It's not meant to be a "wet" sauce. If you're looking for a liquidy tomato sauce, there are recipes out there that will deliver that.

Added 1/2 cup water with in the 4 hours. NYT YouTube video was very helpful in showing how the sauce should look at every stage. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5wr6RCFYKGA  Added more salt at the end. Combined cooked pappardelle, 1/2 tblsp butter, and 1 cup of sauce. Divided into 2 servings and served with Parmesan. A lot of work but excellent results.

(I'd have used pancetta instead, but didn't have any on hand.) Cooking down, first the milk, and then the wine, took longer than predicted, but, then, I had increased the recipe by 1/3 to have left-over sauce for freezing.  The sauce was absolutely first-rate with fresh fettucini.

- **Comment Body:** This was delicious. You have to stay home and cook this so you can continue to stir and add water every 30 minutes or so, but in winter, I don’t really mind. I added about 3 cups of water over the course of 3-4 hours as the sauce was simmering. I tasted it and added more salt to taste. I used shellbows/lumache, and they carried the thick sauce well. I do wish this could have a little more umami, so maybe I’ll throw in some mushrooms next time. Stick with all the tedious steps. Worth it!

At first, the bubbling will be vigorous, but as the liquid level decreases, the bubbles will become smaller and more intermittent. You should look for the liquid to become thicker and more syrupy. If you see a thick, concentrated residue rather than a liquid, it's a good sign that most of the liquid has evaporated."

Legend has it this dish was invented there.2. A lot of time can be saved arranging potatoes on their ends by taking a nice Yukon Gold, placing it in a wooden spoon (the spoony-end) and slicing till your knife hits the spoon. The tater stays together nicely at the bottom and it's very easy to handle. You can google this.

Brought to the dinner, sprinkled cheese on top and did final baking of about 40 minutes at the meal (removed foil half way through.) Texture was great! I was worried because initially liquid barely covered bottom of pan, but juices came out with baking and it was perfect! Good crusty bits on bottom too. A real keeper of a recipe.

- **User Display Name:** John A.
- **Comment Body:** I've read reference here to soaking the potatoes in water before making the dish- as a shortcut or "timesaver" I suppose- even from a food editor at the Times.  Big mistake. Any of these gratin Dauphinois kind of potato dishes (sliced potatoes baked in cream) need the natural starch of the potato mixed with the cream to thicken it, not to mention the flavor of the potato. Soaking the sliced potatoes washes starch & flavor away and reduces the quality of the finished dish.

- **Comment Body:** I made this dish for Thanksgiving with sweet potatoes (not yams) to wild success. My family practically hoisted me upon their shoulders. When I called my mother a week later, she answered the phone without a hello: "Those sweet potatoes were the best thing I've ever eaten." I said, "Hi, Mom. How's everything?" She said, "God, those sweet potatoes were good." I give my full throated endorsement for this recipe. It can make you feel like a conquering hero.

- **Comment Body:** I would say it serves 6, but it depends on what else you are serving. I made a double batch in an 11x13 pan and it was about 12 one-cup servings. My guests fell on it like starving wolves and ate every scrap, so you should probably err on the side of too much rather than too little. It is THAT delicious. Since my dish was rectangular I put the slices in rows. There was a gap along the edge of the pan, so I pushed the rows together more tightly to make room for another full row.

I used 6 ounces of Gruyere cheese, and half and half instead of the heavy cream.

Great flavor and I will make it correctly next time. I was glad to have help in the kitchen-it's a lot of prep work and the cream was flying when I was placing the creamy potato stacks in the dish. Also, recommend placing the casserole on a baking sheet in the oven.

Use more stock to bring the liquid level to halfway up the casserole walls.You need cream for the rich flavor.  Whole milk won't taste the same.  Still, it would probably be absolutely delicious even with milk.

I added more cream as the amount in the recipe didn't seem enough, probably increased the cream by about 1/3.  The recipe is a bit deceiving however, it has the appearance of something that you slave over for hours but other than the labor of thinly slicing the potatoes, which I did manually, it's quite easy.  Pretty and delicious enough for special occasions!

Next time I make it, I will reserve about a cup of the cream mixture and add it to the gratin during the last part of baking for extra creaminess and moisture.For those who don't have a mandoline due to the cost, look for a Japanese mandoline.  Professional chefs use them because of their durability, ease of use, and low cost.  One brand name is Benriner.  I used mine to slice the potatoes in about 3 minutes.

At this point you could take it out, cover, and store.To finish, the called for final 30 minutes won't cut it, I don't think, since it will have to be brought back up to temperature, so add some extra time.

- **Comment Body:** The reason for the broken sauce might be the high fat content of the heavy cream and cheese combined with the high oven temp.  When I made this, instead of doing it as written, I made a roux with butter and flour, whisked in whole milk, then stirred in the cheese.  The roux helps emulsify everything into a smooth creamy sauce.  It's a little bit more work, but the result was beautiful!

Maybe I shouldn't have packed them in so tightly (per the recipe); I was disappointed that more of the sauce didn't cover more of the potato slices, after all my massaging.  Maybe my onlookers were jealous they weren't getting special treatment!  Also used the Cuisinart on #4 to slice potatoes.  Success!

If you want to make potatoes ahead, try this recipe for mashed potato casserole, which is an exception to the do-not-refrigerate-potatoes rule. The potatoes are mashed with sour cream, and so while they are dense (rather than fluffy), they are also creamy and smooth: http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013923-mashed-potato-casserole

- **Comment Body:** We've been playing around with this recipe for a while now, and we've come up with some additions we really like:  1. We increased the Gruyere from 3 oz. to 4 oz., divided between the sauce and the topping.  2. We added 1/2 cup of grated cheddar to the top of the casserole during the final baking period. Nice caramelization!  3. We added about a teaspoon of smoked paprika to the sauce (this dish LOVES smoked paprika!)  4. We've added a little ground rosemary to the topping.

- **Comment Body:** I made this with Asiago and oregano (what I had on hand). Divine. There wasn’t a scrap left.   Advice of note: don’t rinse or soak your potatoes, coat the dish heavily with butter ( you could tell there was potential for a real mess), and don’t use all the cream (I failed to get a good amount of crisp because the fluid was too high).

Next time I will bake for the first 60 minutes ahead of time, chill it, and when ready to serve it for a meal, put in the oven for the last 30 to 40 minutes. Cover with foil for the first 20 minutes. Will also try half and half instead of the cream.

- **Comment Body:** Agree with Linda, this is a time consuming version of this recipe.  There are a number of hasselback recipes on the web that are quicker.  That said, this recipe coats all the slices nicely with the cheese mixture which other recipes don't do as well.  This recipe would be good for special occasions and/or holidays.  I am adding to the Thankgiving menu this year.

In any case, here's what i got when I served it: the cheese had curdled out of the liquid; the bottoms of the potatoes were undercooked and the tops were almost like crisps; and the flavor was very mild, almost too milky. Put it back in the oven at slightly lower temp and it cooked through.  Very supportive diners that night.

I think that comment is up there in the top comments I've gotten for my food. I used Yukon Gold potatoes but followed the recipe otherwise. Someone said 1 tsp of salt was not nearly enough so I used close to 2 teaspoons and it was on the brink of too salty, but everyone still loved them. I also sliced my finger pretty deeply on the mandoline, so be careful yall.

- **Comment Body:** On the note about the gruyere being bland: I made batches on successive weekends for two different holiday dinners. I have to say, the first batch I could only get my hands on a “cave aged” gruyere, which had a texture closer to the parmesan.  Those potatoes were amazing and didn’t need much salt.   Second batch was a softer, less aged gruyere and the results were noticeably less flavorful. Still tasty, but the mature cheese was remarkable. Worth the investment.

Have made it as specified and a "lighter" version with milk (it doesn't separate like the cream) and a touch of Parmesan, not for caloric reasons because I used what I had on hand. Other than cooking time, it's a delicious recipe and a nice change from standard dauphinois

Also, because I'd used a hand grater on the cheddar and it was a little stringy, I used an immersion blender on the sauce, which I think was a good move.

- **Comment Body:** I made them again, and this time did a better job following the instructions. Since I was making it for 2 people, I used a mini loaf pan and 3-4 smallish russet potatoes. After removing it, I let it sit and it wasn't greasy; maybe it was absorbed into the potatoes. I covered it for 30 min, then uncovered for 30 min, then added cheese and cooked ~20 min. Success. I hand sliced the potatoes since it was for two it worked OK. If it were for a crowd, I would use my food processor.

I have never tasted a good potato on this continent until I started to grow my own in healthy soil and with natural soil enrichments every year. I use European seed potatoes. I keep wondering how North American farmers manage to grow such a poor product engeneerd to death from dead soil cicked up with chemicals.

I used a round 9" round pie pan,formed the potatoes into a flower starting from the outside.

Granted I did use half-n-half and chicken stock instead of heavy cream, but added more cheese than the recipe called for.  It was easy enough to make though, so I would maybe do it again and add some leeks and/or ham or bacon as some have suggested.  It was better reheated the next day.  It did take longer to cook than the 1.5 hours in the recipe.

After reading many of the reviews regarding partially or uncooked potatoes in the final dish, decided to “par cook” in the microwave on high, uncovered for 20 minutes after assembling. Following that the dish went into the fridge after it cooled until about an hour before my guests arrived. Then after coming back to room temp. went into a 400 degree oven, foil covered, for 30 minutes, then 10 minutes foil removed and topped with remaining cheese—Delicious!

The prep is a wee bit labor intensive (active prep was at least 30 min, as I don't have a mandoline and grated the cheese by hand), but none of the steps were difficult. And it was so worth it.

- **Comment Body:** I made this with only aged cheddar since it was all I had on hand and it was delicious. The cream mixture really needs a lot of salt - it tasted very salty to me before I poured it over the potatoes but the finished dish still needed an extra sprinkling. I think this is probably why some commenters find the dish unappetizing.

- **Comment Body:** I badly wanted this recipe to work. But it has failed three times. I try to follow recipe as given, but the result has been poor at best. My problems, 1. The sauce breaks (becomes grainy and greasy) after it comes out of the oven. 2. The potatoes are undercooked at the times given. 3. It is straight-up bland. The crispy bits on top are ok, but everything else, nope. This recipe has 5 star average over 6000 ratings. I’m happy people have success, but the recipe simply hasn’t worked for me.

I was feeding 24 and had some celeriac and turnip in the fridge (the end of my winter farm share) so added those to the doubled recipe.   I baked it in my mother’s 72 year old le creuset casserole dish, just as specified and it came out perfect! Not one potato leftover and everyone raved about it.

- **Comment Body:** I think I may have been mistaken when I assumed that the entire two tablespoons of butter in the ingredients list were meant to be smeared into the baking dish to butter it, as directed. The finished result tasted good but there was a 1/8” lake of melted butter remaining in the bottom of the pan when the potatoes were served which looked very accidental.

Dumped them back in the bowl, mixed them with the cheese, and rearranged them a little less neatly.  Then I started to wonder when I was supposed to put in the salt and pepper and looked more closely - oops.  Out came the potatoes again, salt & pepper added, arranged semi-randomly, and all was well.  They were good just not so beautiful.

I no longer welcome canned soups into my life, so this recipe is a welcome find for me. I made it with goat milk instead of cream, and the result is super savory and tasty. I’ll definitely be making it again, with different cheeses and maybe a combination of cream and goat milk for a little more of a saucy result. Delicious!

Mine were in the oven for 45, 45, and then about 30 minutes. Make sure to taste the cream mixture to make sure you use enough salt and pepper. I did add a small amount of cayenne pepper. Next time I will up it to 1/2 tsp.

- **Comment Body:** EPIC FAIL!! I’ve never had a dish turn so wrong in such a spectacularly public fashion. I cooked the first two steps the day before Thanksgiving. Pulled out the dish the day of, let it come to room temp only to discover that it was not cooked all the way through, so exposed potatoes had turned black. It then took TWO HOURS in the oven and most potatoes were still the consistency of apple slices. My guests were charitable and kind, but it was awful. Next year? Good old fashioned mashed potatoes!

- **Comment Body:** This was gravely disappointing.    The liquid thickened while I was dipping the slices, and I ran out.  I added more cream to finish up the dipping.  Then the "liquid" loosened up when it went into the oven, and mostly submerged the vertical slices so I had almost no crunchy layer at all.  Also, oils from the cheese separated during baking, leaving a greasy oil slick at the bottom of the pan.    This was marginally better as leftovers.

- **Comment Body:** Delicious! On our go-to side list for holidays. Modifications: doubled both cheeses. Notes: ended up over salting, so limit to 1 tsp of coarse kosher in the cream mixture and none on top (cheeses are salty on top). If you are using the mandolin and potatoes are actually 1/8” thin then cooking time is perfect. Did soak the potatoes in cold water as we peeled them so they didn’t brown but you shouldn’t do so any longer since they need the starch to make the gooey sauce as it bakes.

Put each potatoe in a wooden spoon, slice but so that it keeps together in the base. Plenty of butter on top, breadcrumbs and bake in the oven for an hour, basing with more butter. Hasselbackenis a pretty good hotel/restaurant in Stockholm owned partly by Bjorn Ulvaeus from ABBA.

- **Comment Body:** I was lured by the photo and followed the directions as written, packing the potato slices tightly in an oval baking dish.  After 3x30' @400, the potato edges looked beautiful, but the inner section was virtually raw. I had to pull it apart and cook for another hour. In notable contrast, another NYT Hassleback recipe calls for cooking single sliced potatoes @425 for 60-70', which open up naturally during cooking. (Lidey Heuck, #1024487). It seems odd that both recipe temps/times are correct.

I found that it was not as good this way. It took much longer than the final 30 minutes, the potatoes were not as smooth and creamy as when done in one long session and the cream did not cook down as much. I would never do it again this way as I felt you lost the superior flavor and texture of the recipe as is published.

- **Comment Body:** I regret that I made this recipe. It cannot begin to compare to classical French gratins, which are easier to make and to riff on. Mostly it seemed a waste of good ingredients. The top was tough more than "crunchy;" the lower half more gluey than soft and winning. Even with more salt & thyme, a waste of more gruyere & parmesan, it doesn't add up to more than a look for presentation's sake. Not worth it. Back to Julia Child again.

- **Comment Body:** I found simply placing the marinated shrimp on top of the orzo to steam left a slight raw garlic taste, will try again, lightly sauteing (but not fully cooking) the marinated shrimp in the butter and olive oil first to avoid raw garlic taste, removing shrimp, proceeding with the orzo, then finishing by steaming shrimp on orzo at the end. Agree on reducing the amount of liquid to 1-1/2 cups stock. I made quick shrimp stock from the shells removed from shrimp. Nice, light, flavorful dish.

The recipe offers a choice of boiling water or stock--wasn't sure if "boiling" was modifying all the nouns or just water (oh, the dangers of a liberal arts education!).  This recipe will become one of my standard shrimp rotations.

Tossed the toasted orzo with some oregano and thyme, and some fragrant peppercorns. I added a tiny amount of Pecorino Romano at the end as well as chives in lieu of parsley. Hugely successful in the household, will make again... perhaps with a bit of anchovy paste or pine nuts. Perfect for riffing!

- **Comment Body:** Excellent flavor and nice presentation. Substituted Israeli pearl couscous for orzo and cooked a little longer. Used homemade clam broth (one cup), quick broth made from shrimp shells (second cup of liquid). Made a huge difference using flavorful seafood broth. Served in large bowls. Two of us ate entire four serving portion.

### Recipe: Shrimp Scampi with Orzo

- **User Display Name:** Jaclyn
- **Comment Body:** I made this recipe exactly as described and found there was way too much liquid resulting in me having to cook the orzo to death in order to not have a soup.  I would also suggest less red pepper flakes as this was incredibly spicy.

- **Comment Body:** I added a couple of tablespoons of tomato purée to the broth, and cut down the broth to 1.5 cups as suggested here. A large handful of halved cherry tomatoes in the pan with the orzo as it cooked.   More garlic than called for.  A delicious, deep flavour.  Handfuls of rocket and parsley on the finished dish (which was quite wet—like a runny risotto).  Green beans on the side.  It tasted of summer and the Mediterranean, and even my fussiest daughter liked it.  It was lovely, and I will make again

- **User Display Name:** MMM
- **Comment Body:** Didn’t have orzo, made with linguine.  Used quick stock made from shrimp shells and tails.  Diners were delayed, so at halfway point of cooking pasta, had to take it off heat, cover it, and let it sit for 20 minutes in pan before resuming cooking and adding shrimp.  This resulted in pasta that had wonderfully absorbed the garlic and stock flavors but was just al dente.  Huge hit.  Will make it that way again.

- **Comment Body:** Have now prepared again. I tweeked a tiny bit. This time I used seafood broth for cooking liquid. Originally I , too, found the finished product too soupy. Therefore, before adding lemon and parsley and finishing s & p, I removed cover and increased the flame for about a minute to quickly reduce the liquid. I worried this would overlook the shrimp, but at all a problem. The flavors concentrated, and the final dish was savory and wonderful. A dish for 4 barely made it through supper (we are 2!)

Used chicken stock, cooked pasta for 12 minutes then added the shrimp.  Cooked that 2 1/2 minutes, let it rest for a minute, and the chief critic (my bride of 33 years) absolutely raved.  This is a keeper.  10 Oz pasta, 12 large shrimp, and finished with a handful of chopped Italian parsley.  Awesome.

BUT, I live in a rural town and often don’t have access to fresh seafood so I use frozen and it’s still tasty. My kids don’t know the difference! I use shrimp stock to boost the flavor a bit.

Oh, I did toss in a cup of frozen peas along with the shrimp so I could skip making a salad.

More intense flavor as sauces cling in the shredded edges, easier to manage a bite instead of a chew.. the platter stars a few prettily grilled intact specimens for special occasions.. using small pasta such as orzo is the perfect opportunity to save your pennies on smaller shrimp to be chopped.

- **Comment Body:** Excellent! I followed the recipe to a "T" with one exception: even though I was using a medium-sized, covered skillet I found that the shrimp was taking longer than expected to cook. Fortunately, that was an easy problem to solve: I just flipped the shrimp over and in another couple of minutes it was done to perfection. I hate overcooked shrimp, and I think that waiting for the tops to get done while the bottoms were already thoroughly cooked would have been a mistake.

- **Comment Body:** This was so good. My only quibble is with the cooking time for the shrimp. Maybe I misunderstood the recipe, I thought it was saying to put the shrimp in a layer on top of the orzo and let them cook like that undisturbed for 2-4 minutes - having done that they were still pretty much raw. I stirred them into the orzo and cooked for a few minutes more and they cooked just fine.   Aside from that, a very easy and extremely delicious recipe. I will be adding this to my everyday repertoire.

- **Comment Body:** We took the advice to sauté the shrimp (we used spot prawns caught in the San Juan Islands, WA, which probably made a difference to the overall quality of the dish) for a minute prior to adding it at the end, so the garlic wasn’t raw.  Used a small spiral pasta instead of orzo and it worked out just fine.  We loved the extra sauce, it was so good we ate the whole thing in pasta bowls with spoons so none of it would go to waste.  This is one the best NYT recipes I have made, total home run.

I agree with previous posters about adding the garlic to the pan after toasting the orzo to avoid burning it, and to avoid the sogginess noted previously I popped the entire pan under the broiler for a minute to ensure that the shrimp were cooked through (mine were big fat ones).

For seafood stock, I suggest taking the shrimp shell peelings in this recipe, and boil them for 10 minutes, then drain and use that liquid as your stock.

- **Comment Body:** What a luxurious weeknight meal! I used 2 c. of clam broth as the cooking liquid which deepened the shellfish flavor. When covering to cook the orzo, the heat must be set a bit higher than low - something like medium low so it's at a solid simmer which will help reduce the liquid and cook the orzo properly. We paired this with a pan-seared NY strip to make it the ultimate surf & turf, and would highly recommend doing so!

Next time I will decrease the liquid, or actually, I will add a bit more orzo.    Also, this did not make 4 portions. We got two smallish dinners plus 1 small lunch out of it.

- **Comment Body:** Searing aggressively for about  1-1/2 to 2 minutes per side, and finishing cooking in the sauce until an internal temperature of 143-145°F is reached is definitely the way to go. Don't go by time; use temperature to determine when cooked through. The interior should be pink and juicy, not grey. Use an accurate, instant-read thermometer for consistent results every time. Clocks are for telling time. Thermometers are for telling when food is cooked properly.

- **Comment Body:** Sounds good, but the thing is: Pork chops sold today are almost fat free, You can cook them any way you want, and you'd still have tasteless meat (and if well done, then they're really hideous, tasteless cardboard).  Switch to Pork shoulder (aka pork butt), cut it into 1 inch slices / steaks and cook / grill them with some oil, salt and pepper (or cook them according to this recipe but only 2 minutes per side). You'll never touch pork chops again.  PS: Costco has them for about $2/lb

- **Comment Body:** I just saw this but basically cooked the exact same thing Tonite for dinner except with pounded chicken breasts, and it was phenomenal.  Only difference was I used dill instead of parsley, added a few slices of lemon into the reducing sauce, and did not use capers or zest.  I actually thought I should have added capers as we were eating.  Did not even think of doing this with pork though.  Can't wait to try it.

- **Comment Body:** Jane, If you sear the pork chops first, mid- high heat. 4-5 minutes on both sides w/olive oil as noted in the recipe.  They should finish cooking through in the sauce.  Perhaps a few minutes extra if they're very thick cut chops.  Gone are the days of overcooked dried out pork.  Trichinosis isn't much of a work today. Try to purchase good quality Berkshire pork.

- **Comment Body:** There is a danger with seasoning the chops with dried Thyme before frying them - the Thyme is likely to burn and end up adding bitter grains of charcoal to the resulting dish, ruining its taste. Instead, add the dried Thyme to the sauce with the wine and stock. I adjusted the dish slightly - I added medium-dry cider (alcoholic, as always in the UK) instead of wine and added a chopped leaf of fresh Sage instead of dried Thyme to the sauce. I also added the jus from the chops to the sauce. Great!

- **Comment Body:** Just made this - a lovely recipe with a great sauce. Here's a genius addition: chard stems. I had a bunch of them leftover after harvesting my chard and using only the leaves. I cut the stems into 3-4 inch lengths, and simmered them after adding the liquids in Step 2. I covered the pan and let them cook until tender - about 8-10 minutes, then I removed the cover and reduced the sauce. Everything else stayed the same. I served the pork chops on a bed of chard stems with the sauce covering it all.

This is a recipe I will not tinker with.  Cooked the thick chops five minutes on a side so they didn’t toughen up. Might even do four minutes next time.  This is the first caper-lemon sauce I have ever really loved and with the sweet potatoes it was simply incredible!

- **Comment Body:** This dish was super delicious.  My husband raved. I incorporated a lot of tips from other commenters: I dusted the chops with flour before cooking. I fried on high heat for 2 min and 15 seconds per side; I saved the thyme to put in with wine and chicken broth; I did not drain the fat (there wasn't much and it's full of flavor). I saved out some parsley & capers to sprinkle on when serving. Instead of hot sauce, I sprinkled with chili pepper flakes when serving for even more color. Beautiful!

- **Comment Body:** Wonderful recipe. Cooked it as instructed and delicious. Chops need to be from a good butcher, not thin. Take your time to boil down the sauce with the liquid after gently whisking in the flour. I served with a rice and collards recipe — while the rice is at a low simmer put chopped collards on top in the same saucepan and when the rice is done so are the collards — and this was great. I grew up in NC but now live in Northern CA and this dinner made me happy. Thank you for this!

Maybe a slice of crusty bread at the end to catch the last of the sauce.   Preserved lemon zest with the parsley, etc added complexity that fresh zest did not.  Mmm.

- **Comment Body:** Lovely sauce; even better the next day. That being said, I agree with others that two tsp flour is not enough, nor is three. Next time: two tbsp. Also, an eight ounce bone-in pork chop is ca. 1/2 inch thick. The searing time is too long and risks drying out the chop. I reduced the time by half; it was still on the edge of too dry. Instead of medium high heat, I'd suggest high heat for about two minutes on each side.

I used close to 2 TBSP of flour for thickening & cooked it slowly & longer with the pork chops in sauce to make them more tender & flavorful. Added chicken broth as needed.  Used half the lemon juice & half of the capers in the simmering sauce. Saved the lemon zest, parsley & remaining half of the capers & added during the last few minutes of cooking to preserve their delicate flavors. Had to shoo my husband out of the kitchen

Although there are similarities to piccata, the recipe yielded a lovely, robust brown sauce, and the addition of thyme was delightful. I cooked the chops as prescribed, and after warming in the sauce, they were slightly pink. Highly recommend!

No add’l salt @ time recipe says  4: Scored fat  5: used Pinot Gris for sauce since my choice to have w/ dinner. 6: used meat thermometer to 140.  7: left fat & EVOO in pan.

Did not drain the fat, instead used 1/2 the butter listed and browned the shallot and garlic.  I added 1 tbsp of flour so it wasn't gravy, but not as thin if you only used 2 tsp.  Deglazed the pan with wine, stock and thyme.  After it almost reduced, added the chops back to the pan to finish cooking.  Finished as written but didn't add the extra butter to sauce.  yum

In facts it’s probably the least “jollof” tasting jollof I’ve ever had but it’s still delicious  3) recommend cooking on stove as opposed to oven. You will achieve the slight burn to the bottom which provides excellent flavor. I cooked it between 4-5 on electrical stove for 30 min, then left covered 10

- **Comment Body:** Good recipe, but I doubt Ms. Komolafe's claim that smoked paprika substitutes for the caramelized rice that's obtained by stovetop cooking. Iranian cuisine uses caramelization for chelo rice: the delicious browned bottom crust, the "tahdig", is savory-sweet rather than smoky. I'd use a wide non-stick pan instead of the oven in step 4, and after the stock is absorbed, set the heat to low (2/10 on electric heat) and cook lid-on for 30 mins unattended.

I love how spicy , I love how tomato-y it is . It's just so delicious, all of it.  The sweetness of the onions really work well here, I usually make more than what the recipes call for because everyone end up fishing for more onions.   It's honestly a delicious dish. And I love this recipe.

- **Comment Body:** The wording on the rice ingredient isn't precise: parboiled long-grain rice, basmati or jasmine rice.  If I use basmati, do I parboil it? If not, reversing the sequence would be clearer: basmati, jasmine or parboiled type long-grain rice.

- **Comment Body:** Raw chicken will give the rice that 'raw chicken' smell. Rice absorbs the flavors around it, so unless you want that, nah. Whenever I add chicken to a rice dish, I make sure to braise it in its own liquids first (pan, no water, medium heat) until browned. Bone-in preferably. Then I add it right after the tomatoes/peppers/spices, and reduce the heat until the chicken is coated. Then I add the liquid (broth or water), and then the rice, and cook as directed here.

- **Comment Body:** I would swap the turmeric with nutmeg, then add some curry powder and thyme. Also cook on the stove!  Yet to meet anyone who doesn’t like jollof rice. Whenever I have a party and serve it, some of the non-Nigerians want takeaway, the rest are to shy to ask because when I offer, it’s a resounding yes. For the Nigerians, the takeaway is a given. My point is, if you make this dish for a party, the custom is to make enough that your guests can have takeaways.

Perfectly salty and tomatoey and such depth of flavor from the herbs and garlic and chicken broth. Amazing.  Tomorrow I want the leftovers with some sliced avocado and a fried egg on top!  We served ours with some simple lemony herbed grilled chicken thighs and an all frisée salad.  I feel very feted.

I made the full obe ata recipe and halved the rest, using one cup of obe ata in the final dish. The ratio of 1.5 cups rice:1 cup obe ata:1 cup broth yielded perfectly cooked rice, and I’m picky. Out of necessity I did use jalapeño instead of habanero, a whole one gave it a mild spice level. Delicious!!

Vegetable added in along with the rice: sweet green pepper chopped, string beans or green beans, green peas,carrots, chopped, cabbage, chopped. 4 cups of rice are added but only 2 cups of broth, so it seems as if this is parboiled rice, or else more liquic would be added. I cooked a simplified version.

- **Comment Body:** This was wonderful - richly flavored but not too spicy! I made all the obe ata but planned to cook only 1 cup of rice, so I added the tomato paste, turmeric and paprika to the pan before cooking down the puree in Step 2. Used part of the resulting sauce to cook the rice and put the rest in the freezer for later! I used brown jasmine rice and since I was unsure about the timing for the oven, I just made it in a saucepan - it took about 10 minutes longer than usual. Already excited to make again.

It came out fine, but I found that the heat of the pepper obliterated the other flavors that I was looking forward to tasting: turmeric, thyme, bay. I love heat, but I might try this again by seeding the pepper, or adding only half the seeds.

A slow grower it develops into a well branched tree some 3' around & 4' tall. I have repoted w'new organic soil every other year. FRESH Bay leaf is obviously easy to find in any area that stays above freezing but here in Zone 7/8 it's a lovely houseplant!

Very delicious, but I think it would be even better if I took actual half the amount of rice that is in the recipe (that is 1 1/2 cup). I agree with people who said that you can substitute parboiled rice with not parboiled one without changing the recipe but be careful with the liquid ingredients (regular rice may demand more stock)

I use a whole can of paste for a deeper red coloring and tomato flavor. The obe ate gets 2 or 3 habanero peppers. If you have an African store nearby, pick up some dried fish or shrimp powder. Nutmeg also enhances the smoky flavor. I only use jasmine rice.  He does love that browned rice on the bottom!

When fixing the rice used basmati. Beef stock which next time I will use low sodium. Cooked everything in a large deep skillet on gas cooktop. Removed cover after 30 minutes cooking at medium low. Very thin layer of rice was deeply browned which, when mixed with rest of dish gave everything a magnificent flavor. Thanks Ms. Komolafe!

Twice the liquid with 2X the rice would probably be too soupy - maybe make double the obe ata but only use about 3 1/2 c for this recipe and save 1/2 c for some other purpose?  As for cook time, it might take a few minutes longer, but the rice will cook pretty much in the time suggested on the rice package no matter the quantity.

I used homemade vegetable stock and fresh turmeric which was definitely the move. I served it with the Beef Suya (Tofu Suya for me).

- **Comment Body:** To everyone asking "where's the curry" or "how much curry," the term curry doesn't refer to a specific spice blend, but rather to a style of food in some aromatic sauce that goes with rice or bread. In some curries, the flavors are cumin, coriander, turmeric, etc - in this one, they're ginger, garlic, basil, and miso. There are about a million types of curry, and no two taste exactly the same.

I also used bok choy instead of spinach because it’s all I had on hand, and it was great. I added the bok choy about 1 minute before the salmon, which I then cooked for 4 mins. I’ll do the same next time I make this, which will be soon!

Brought liquid up to only 3c total w water.  5) Used 1lb Patagonian scallops - so good in this!

I think the key is caramelizing the miso; all of a sudden at about the 2 minute mark as instructed the pan started to smell wonderfully when that started to happen. If you add the liquid too soon it’s easy to see that this could fall flat.

- **Comment Body:** One of the few recipes I crave enough to make over and over again. After several tries, I've learned the best adjustments are 1) use the whole can of coconut milk, 2) use less water (I just refill the coconut milk can from the tap), and 3) add some heat, like a glug of sriracha. The first two are essential, the third is personal preference.  If your fish comes with skin, make sure to remove it first (or better yet have your fish monger do it).

- **Comment Body:** This 👏 is 👏 amazing 👏. (If for some reason emojis don’t go through, there are claps in there for emphasis.) My boyfriend was so worried about liking this and then couldn’t stop complimenting it! Everything comes together so perfectly. I used light coconut milk (1 c to 2 c water), upped the ginger and garlic for more pungency and was liberal with the fresh herbs at the end. Added broccoli and green beans for additional greens. Is it shameful to lick the bowl?

- **Comment Body:** So delicious! Added some fresh lemongrass I picked up today, plus extra garlic and ginger and it was great! Make sure you really caramelize the miso really well, to the point where it has darkened in colour and has caramelized the bottom of the pan. I find this is closer to five minutes than two. Be careful of the salt with this as the miso is very salty as it is. Really convenient and flavourful dinner!

My changes: I added 1 tbsp. fish sauce, used Thai basil instead of Italian basil, and used 1 cup coconut milk and 1.5 cups water for the liquid.  In addition to adding the herbs and lime juice at the end, I also topped the finished dish with sliced red fresno chile to add some heat.  I served the curry over cilantro rice.  A tasty and fast weeknight dinner.

- **Comment Body:** Just made this for the third time using frozen wild salmon (coho? sockeye? Not king) from Costco. I used a whole can of coconut milk, and replaced the 3 cups of water with a coconut milk can full of shrimp stock I had in the freezer, and added a dash of red pepper flakes. Absolutely delicious. Using the stock made the biggest difference, increasing the depth of flavor to a whole new level. It was very rich with the whole fat coconut milk. I think it would be fine with light.

I used only 2 cups of water & 1/2 coconut cream (which I prefer over coconut milk) and added a dash of crushed red pepper. I tasted it before adding the cream and it reminded me of miso ramen. The coconut milk/cream really brings out the savory/umami flavor in this dish. Recipe calls for basil, I'd recommend thai or holy basil (rather than genovese).

I found it far too mild and milky for my taste, and lacking any of the flavors I was expecting. I added two tablespoons of Thai red curry paste to push it closer to what I hoped this recipe would be. It is more like "aromatic coconut soup with salmon" as currently written.

Because of the extra coconut milk I added only two cups of water but next time I’ll use half the amount of water because it seemed too soupy. With brown rice it worked fine. I added a chopped sweet red pepper to the broth when I heated it to boil and tossed sliced scallions on top along with basil. It was a beautiful dish and presentation.

- **Comment Body:** This is a lovely, easy recipe that makes for a very enjoyable meal. I thought 3 cups of water was a bit much so I cut back to 2 1/2 cups, then reduced quite a bit to get more flavor, next time I’ll try with less, 2 cups. Adding the spinach on top of the salmon pieces makes it difficult to incorporate without breaking up the fish, I transferred the fish pieces to a plate before adding the spinach to the sauce, when done pour over the fish. If you like spice, Thai chile sliced on top is 👍

Next time more garlic and ginger, maybe some jalapeno.  Quick and easy sauce, could have many different proteins.

- **Comment Body:** Tried this dish tonight. Instead of cooking the salmon in the pan, I marinated it and grilled it to lay on top of the dish. Needed more spice/ heat. Will add maybe red chili pepper flakes, a little of the Mexican lime seasoning and add stuff to taste. White wine in place of water. Overall, a clean dish. Love the basil and lime for added favor! Definitely a keeper!

I made this last night, taking into account the comments about the ratio of coconut milk to water: one full can of coconut milk and 1C fish stock instead of water.  At least doubled the ginger and garlic and added three whole dried thai chilies to steep in the liquid while it reduced.  Finished with lime zest along with the called-for basil and cilantro.  This will definitely be in our regular rotation - super easy and so flavorful!

- **Comment Body:** to avoid killing all the wonderful probiotics naturally occurring in miso, I recommend taking a cup of the heated (NOT BOILING) broth into a bowl, whisk in the miso, then pour the miso/broth back into the curry. Try to do this step last after everything has been cooked so the miso keeps all its wonderful health benefits <3

Everything else was on hand, since I make pretty much weekly trips to a local Asia market.  Even a bit of yellow miso, which worked just fine. I had frozen brown rice, so just threw that into the pot. It is a very quick and easy, and reasonably healthy, delicious meal. Wild salmon, spinach, brown rice, ginger, garlic, coconut, fresh herbs? YES!

- **Comment Body:** Love. The miso adds salt, umami, sweetness and thickens the sauce to boot. Makes an easy & delicious coconut curry base that would really accommodate almost anything. Adjustments: tripled the ginger & garlic, substituted bok choy for spinach, reduced water, increased the coconut milk, added Thai chilis and jalapeños, put in three bunches of Thai basil to cook with the fish, added two cooked, cubed sweet potatoes. Cilantro and lime at the end are critical to add freshness & acid to taste.

- **Comment Body:** This is not a good recipe. 3 cups of water is far too much, and produced a thin, diluted, brown-ish broth that was highly unappetizing. Considering the prep time and number of ingredients involved, it is hard to believe the resulting flavor was so lackluster. I would not recommend others make this as-written, and even with modifications, I think the concept if flawed.

Shallots instead of onion  I first put the salmon in the oven and broiled it for about 5 minutes, then took it out and let it rest.  Before I added the salmon to the curry, I let the sauce reduce for 15 minutes on a low heat, it really elevated the flavors and made for a more creamy texture.

I would add another veggie, maybe sliced red peppers. It may need a little kick of heat for some people. You could also vary the fish, IMO.  The question I always have is WHY WHY WHY doesn't the NYTimes add water as an ingredient? I mean, it's an ingredient in this recipe! Yet water is not listed. This bugs me.

It doesn't require prep, it is done on the go.  Proportions will change depending on taste (more or less wine, etc). A touch of vermouth is only done is some parts of the country (I don´t fancy that one as much, is less refreshing in my opinion). Many times simpler is better.

- **Comment Body:** Following up on my note, I tried both the sprite and homemade lemon lime syrup/club soda and liked them both. The sweet vermouth came through with more nuance and complexity than the sprite but both delicious and colorful. Perfect for a fair summer evening.

- **Comment Body:** I made the simple syrup today and let it steep. I used only lemons because I have a tree. To make the drink, I used the proportion of wine and syrup given without sweet vermouth and topped with San Pellegríno. It was delicious. I drank 3 of them and still only had 6 ounces of wine—great for a hot day.  You could certainly use whatever lemon lime soda you have available in the absence of the Spanish one, but the lemony sweet of the syrup was delightful And did not mask the taste of the wine.

- **Comment Body:** I've spent a lot of time in Seville. While this recipe looks fine and delicious, in Seville they use a large tumbler type glass, put in about 1/3 hearty red, fill with club soda or a lemony soda, add a slice of orange and ice. That's it.. A very basic spritz but lovely and refreshing and absolutely no fuss. Of course works with a nice dry inexpensive white wine too.

If you can’t find the Casera in the US, my Spanish friends recommend cutting up “summer fruit”—stone fruit, fresh crushed berries—to add to Tempranillo in a pitcher and offering Wegmans Frizzante Sicilian Lemon Soda so people can adjust their drink to taste.

- **Comment Body:** I make my Spanish sangria with Squirt. It’s the closest thing I have found to Fanta de Limón which is what they used for sangria and tinto de verano in the 90’s when I studied at the University of Seville. We don’t get lemon Fanta in the U.S. (though I foundnit once at a Polish grocer in Chicago in the early 2000’s), and I don’t know where to find Kas.

Then add the garlic and ginger and add 1/2 tsp turmeric, 1/2 tsp coriander and 1/2 tsp cumin and 2 Tbs Sriracha.   Sauté these and then do the rice and other steps and add 3 bay leaves before baking.   I added lime juice to finish it after it baked.    I would also consider adding peas.

- **Comment Body:** Yes, they are different. Green peppers are unripened peppers and have a very distinct taste. Peppers in different stages of ripeness, depending on the variety are yellow, orange and red. The yellow is the sweetest, orange about the same and the red has a very distinct ripened flavor and is the one most often used in Italian cooking.

And I even doubled the garlic, ginger, and scallions, and added Tajin with lime. I was seduced by the one-pot mystique and regret it. I think it would have been good if I'd cooked the rice in the broth in another pot and simmered the rest of the ingredients in the coconut milk.

The measurement provided for scallions is misleading. I used more than a full bunch and barely had the half cup called for. I also added some raisins which did, in fact, add a lovely sweetness - a la an Indian biryani. It was FABULOUS, especially with some sriracha.

HOWEVER, I noticed one thing — if I added hot sauce (we used Frank's), the coconut rice was overwhelmed by the spice and did seem rather bland.   My suggestion: SKIP THE HOT SAUCE! (And I say that as someone who loves spicy food and uses a lot of hot sauce on other things.)

I recommend adding a splash of fish sauce or coco aminos if you have it, for a little extra umami. We also used basmati rice b/c that is what we had on hand. Other than that, we followed the recipe exactly and were so impressed at the high flavor yield. Simply delish! 5 stars!

- **Comment Body:** Super easy and fairly tasty one-pot recipe!  I followed the recipe pretty closely except I didn’t have cilantro. It was decent, but bc of the chicken fat, coconut milk, and nuts, it really needs a little something to cut through the richness. None of my hot sauces were quite right, so I used red curry paste instead (thinned w hot water). Perfect! Next time I’ll use more salt, remove some rendered chicken fat, fry curry paste with aromatics, use cilantro, and finish w a squeeze of lime.

- **Comment Body:** I used sambal oelek for the hot sauce and it was outstanding!  Really good contrast and depth against the coconut milk rice.  The downside to that is those who do not like spicey and left that off thought it was bland, though I was forced to use ground ginger at the last minute.  The cilantro didn't add much value, but I dark roasted my cashews in the oven while I browned the chicken and I think that added a lot of texture and flavor.  Might change out the yellow pepper next time.

- **Comment Body:** I’ve tried this recipe a couple of times with seitan instead of chicken, and it was a huge hit both times. Once was similar to the recipe except for adding more vegetables for color and flavor. The second time also added two teaspoons of a prepared sauce, in this case Panang curry, and it was far better. Note: this recipe really needs a fresh Thai chili.

- **Comment Body:** The green pepper/capsicum is unripe and tastes distinctively different to any ripe capsicums. Yellow, red and a (slightly) weird orange coloured capsicum are all ripe (all start green) and have their own slightly different flavours but are more like each other in taste than any are to green. Varieties can also vary in shape and thickness of the wall. Mostly we can choose blocky or bullshorn shaped capsicums in the markets but if you grow your own you can explore the range of colours and shapes.

- **Comment Body:** I really wanted to love this. I followed the recipe to a tee except I used bone-in skin-on chicken thighs. Came out weirdly gingery yet bland at the same time. Tried to fix it with several different hot sauces, soy, and lime. Nothing made it work. Feels like it wants to be too many things at once and ends up being nothing. Maybe that's a one-pot recipe problem. It would have been better just to make a curry and use a second pot for rice. I don't think I'll try it again.

Prep takes a long time; cooking is simple and fast. One tip: it was still rather liquidy after I took it out of the oven but after it had sat for a bit, the rice absorbed a lot of liquid, making the end results wonderfully creamy!

Throw the whites into sauté with the ginger and garlic, then throw the greens in with the rest of the ingredients. Squeeze lime over the top at the end, and serve with a lime wedge and extra cilantro. Short grain rice is best to make it sticky, but basmati works fine too.

Added some Fly By Jing masala seasoning for some depth 2. 7 cloves garlic, 2 big knobs ginger, half jalapeno in aromatics. Salt this mix too.  3. Once cooked, mixed in raw spinach to wilt under the heat.  4. Saved the cashews for crunchy topping. Also top with more scallion greens and LIME! This dish needs acid/citrus and pairs perfectly with hot sauce. This is the key imo.

Once the coconut milk and chicken broth were in, I added an 8 ounce container of sliced white mushrooms.  This created a dish that reminds me of the flavors in the Thai soup--Tom Kah Gai.

I got 24  beautiful, crunchy, sweet, salty & spicy cookies with a beautiful swirl pattern. I'm making them again tonight!

- **Comment Body:** Re: the swirling. After reading others notes, I came up with my own approach. Before chilling, I warmed up the gochujang sauce to make it a little thinner, pressed the dough down in the bowl a bit, and did about half a tablespoon of drizzle back and forth over the dough. Then I folded the dough in half and repeated three or four times - basically a lamination approach. Chilled for 15 minutes, and proceeded. It worked beautifully, with big thick ribbons of caramel through the cookies.

I also only had a 2 tbsp cookie scoop instead of a 1/4 cup scoop called for and it worked out great - 12.5 min worked for me but I started checking at 11. Make these!

- **Comment Body:** Love it, the cookie had a great flavor profile - especially if you’re someone who has enjoyed miso cookies in the past - this recipe creates similar umami notes. I struggled to mix the caramel in properly without over-mixing. Ultimately, I did over-mix the two components which caused the cookies to spread too large. Next time I would dollop a bit of the caramel on top of each cookie and swirl it in with a offset knife or something, to avoid this issue.

- **Comment Body:** Egg whites make cookies crunchy. Bakers actually remove egg white from recipes to make their cookies chewier; that's why so many cookie recipes with the word "chewy" in their title will call for 1 egg+ 1-2 yolks. This is also why whites are called for in recipes where you want "stiffening" action, like meringues and coconut macaroons (they help dry out and harden the coconut) and even royal icing.

I suspect that is about the brand of gochujang you are using,  I used some from a nearby grocery store because I was out of my usual (which I buy at an Asian market)  and also had this experience. Then I tasted the paste itself and...ick. It really did taste like bbq sauce. So maybe try again with better product?

I did work some into the dough on the second batch - both ways work well.  I made the cookies a little smaller than recommended.  Probably the most important thing I'll alter next time is to make about half as much of the actual gochujang mixture ... a little goes a long way. Very cool recipe!

Also, perhaps spreading out the dough, layering the gochujang sauce, and then pinwheeling cookies would be more aesthetically pleasing; mine turned out not-pretty, but still delicious.

The method I used was patting the dough into a rectangle, spreading the gochujang caramel, rolling it up into a log, chilling it, cutting the log into 16 slices (for regular sized cookies), and gently rolling each slice into a ball. Topped with a sprinkle of flake salt. For those of you wanting to make ahead -- I froze the dough balls and then baked them right from the freezer. Turned out perfectly!

I rolled the dough out flat, refrigerated it to let it firm up, spread on the caramel, then rolled into a log and refrigerated again. I cut thick slices which I rolled into balls, being careful not to mess up the caramel swirl. This technique worked really well, resulting in beautiful dark swirls of chewy gochujang caramel. I made a peanut butter version, even more delicious

- **Comment Body:** These cookies exceeded all expectations and then some! Truly cannot say enough good things. I highly recommend looking up the corresponding YouTube video to get the swirling technique right, as it was very helpful for me. This recipe made 7 large baker style cookies, so I’d recommend doubling if you’re baking for a crowd. I also topped mine with some flaky sea salt. Final note, these were made more beautiful by fully cooling and tasted great even the next day. Thanks for the amazing recipe!

Next time I will experiment with that. Flavor is still delicious! Also, definitely space the cookies far apart...they spread quite a bit.

- **Comment Body:** Oh. My. Word. You must make these! They are like a Smokey snickerdoodle. For those unfamiliar with it gochujang, it is a slow heat in the way that chipotle can be, but a very different flavor. I couldn’t “swirl” the gochujang in as the recipe indicated, but they came out looking just the same and tasted heavenly. This is not a recipe to miss. Maybe just cook half the dough at a time, or run the risk of eating all the cookies at once. Not that I would know anything about that…..

- **Comment Body:** These are ridiculously good cookies! Delicious and unexpected. I’ve made them twice and incorporated a few “lessons learned.” Firstly, swirl the gochujang caramel into the cookie dough before chilling. It will hold the caramel ribbons if done with intention. Secondly, chill much longer than the recipe calls for. First time, 15 minutes…delicious but too thin of a cookie. Second time, 1 hour chill…perfection! They didn’t spread too much and the edges were perfectly crisp, middles chewy! Perfect.

- **Comment Body:** As a Korean chef who lived half of my life in Korea, I never thought about putting gochujang to caramel.  This really balances out the sweetness and saltness, and a little bit of a kick at the end from gochujang. I made my own cinnamon, and gochujang butter icing at the end to cover the half side of my cookie, the way I like it. Came out real nice. This is one of the kind, best cookie recipe I've tried in a while. Thanks for giving me new ideas with this recipe.

Friends also felt that it was the best cookie they had ever had—complimenting the cookie more than my own baking skills, for sure. Simple, and brilliant, that the gochujang and brown sugar are mixed so that you taste them together. I’m already planning to make these several more times this month for more friends and more personal midnight snacks.

- **Comment Body:** Made 9 large cookies with this recipe, which has an absolutely excellent blend of heat and sweetness. I think you can get the aesthetically appealing swirl if you either just dab it on already-scooped dough; or spread and fold like laminating. They do spread dramatically though, so I would either freeze the dough to minimise spread or make them in half the recommended size.

- **Comment Body:** I made a few batches of these with gluten free 1:1 flour. They don't rise and crackle the way Eric Kim's did in the video, and I found the texture of the softer parts of the cookies to be too mealy for my taste (that's the gluten free flour's fault, not the recipe's!). But when I cooked them for longer - like 15 minutes - and then transferred them (parchment paper and all) to a rack to cool, they turned out golden and consistently crispy, and absolutely delicious.

I was extremely apprehensive, but they came out perfect - chewy with crisp edges and a punch of spice at the end. (No hint of garlic or onion in the final cookie). I’m a believer! Next time I’ll try topping with a bit of sea salt or turbinado sugar for a little extra sparkle and crunch. (My toxic trait is that I always want to gild the lily.)

I added the bok choy stems and shallots with liquids; next time add later.  Next time, I will add more ginger to broth and more heat with extra jalapeno or sambal oleck.

- **Comment Body:** This is so good! Like lots of people have suggested, I tried baking the meatballs in the oven, but having done it both ways I prefer doing it as written. Cooking them on the stove gives you the brown bits on the bottom of the pot that lend a depth of flavor to the broth that's missing when you bake. Didn't bother with the egg and panko, meatballs were a bit sticky but stayed together fine. Definitely takes longer than 1/2 hour, took me closer to a full hour.

- **Comment Body:** This is SO good.  I made it twice with the meatballs, and thereafter I now just use diced chicken tossed with this spice blend: The Gourmet Collection Spice & Seasoning Blend, Thai Style Green Curry- Amazon.  Small other alteration- I put the spinach in the bowls with the rice and then pour the soup over. This keeps the spinach bright and fresh for leftovers.

And, frankly, I'd just add sriracha rather than taking the trouble to grate a fresh jalapeno or a couple of Thai green chilies.

I doubled it and regret not making more.  2. Double the aromatics and add lemongrass 3. Add 1/2 cup panko and 1 egg to the meatballs. I froze half of them for next time I make the soup. We'll see how that turns out 3. Add about 1/4 cup sugar 4. Add chili flakes for heat 5. Let simmer for a couple hours 4. I added mushrooms and bok choy at the end Amazing!

- **Comment Body:** Made this last night and I’m a fan. One kid doesn’t like coconut, so I substituted almond milk. I didn’t have time to batch the meatballs, so I baked them at 425 for 20 min. The meatball mixture was very wet, but that made for tender meatballs. I accidentally left out the salt, which was fine. I used 4 c vs 2 c of broth and added an extra 1/2-1 tablespoon of fish sauce. Next time, I will leave a few of the jalapeño seeds in for a little extra kick. I served it over udon noodles.

Only comment that I have is total prep time and cooking is about 1 hour, taking into account grating or chopping ingredients, mixing and cooking. 30 minutes its truly the amount of time that it takes to cook. I removed the jalapeño seeds and white veins next time I will leave some for some added spice.

Handling the meatball mixture is gooey, but they fry up nicely.  Be patient, let them brown throughly before turning.  They came out moist and scrumptious.  I would not call it a brothy soup.  More like a well moistened rice with meatballs.  To add more heat/spice simply use hot chilies for condiments.

I used high pressure for 6 minutes and natural release for 5 mins.  After cooking I combined the remaining stock from the pressure cooker into the stock/coconut milk combination on the stovetop. The meatballs were fully cooked - very hot and tender - and did not need additional time to cook within the soup as the baked or pan-seared meatballs might.

I added an egg and a handful of panko and baked on parchment-lined cookie sheet at 420 for 20 minutes, rotating pan half-way through.  Skip the panko.  The veggies in broth need dimension.  Bok choy would be good.  Maybe some shredded carrot?  Green onions?  More cilantro?

I split the batch and did half chicken and half Impossible ground meat b/c my husband is vegetarian. We all agreed the Impossible meat made a heartier dish.  Either way I will make this again for sure, just not as a school night quick meal unless I have prepped all the components in advance. I like the idea of doing the meatballs in the oven too - less mess!

I add three tablespoons of fish sauce to the chicken (I did it on accident the first time, but loved the flavor so much). Grating everything definitely takes the most time. Maybe one day I’ll try using a food processor, I just hate to use more dishes. Otherwise, this is DELICIOUS!

I also added an extra can of coconut milk (2 can total)! This worked really well and created the right ratio of broth-to-meatballs for my taste, poured over rice. I just added an extra inch of ginger and a bit more fish sauce. I also liked how the amount of broth mellowed out the spice of the jalapeño (I added the whole thing, seeds included.) YUM!!

As many ahead of me have said the 1/2 cup panko and 1 egg does help immensely for binding. Did the bake thing for the meatballs, but next time will go the fry route to check out taste change, if any.

Absolutely agree with others that this was not a 30-min meal - took me more than an hour, start to finish, and I’m not a beginner.

- **Comment Body:** After browning the beef sauté the onions. Then add about 1 to 2 tablespoons of tomato paste and continue to cook until the color starts to go from bright red to rust. Then deglaze with the wine and vinegar. Add one tall spike of fresh rosemary (leaves removed and chopped) and three to four sprigs of thyme. Follow the recipe and finish with two cups of peas two to three minutes before serving.

Also, homemade peasant bread or even some store bought parker house rolls are a wonderful accompaniment.   This is exactly my mother's go-to recipe for beef stew. She's gone now, but I would give anything to eat this with her one more time.

- **Comment Body:** This was delicious.  I cubed a chuck roast which was cheap and flavorful (removing all excess fat).  I added some worchestershire sauce and ketchup at the end to add umami (flavor). After cooking I separated the solids and boiled the liquid a bit to reduce and concentrate, then whisked in a slurry of flour and water to thicken before recombining with meat and veggies.  This stew is a one pot meal.  It doesn't require rice or noodles because of the large amount of potatoes.

- **Comment Body:** I think many of the negative comments were from people who have no idea what an old time stew tasted like. They probably have McDonald's taste buds and there is no changing that. This was a wonderful stew. With that said I also added to it. My choice was worcester sauce from my Brittish background. Adapting a recipe to fit your own taste is a normal procedure. Perhaps if some of these who commented threw in a Quarte pounder they would have felt differently.

I also throw the bones in (along with marrow) to add flavor. If you're making a big pot, shank is about half the price of chuck!

I chopped up the onion & along with a few table spoons of oil and tomato paste,I microwaved it with the herbs in a bowl for about 1 minute on high (a trick I learned from Cooks Illustrated slow cooker recipe book) & then I added this mixture to the pot at the start of step 2 above. Cooked the meat much longer, a/b 5 hrs before adding veggies.

- **Comment Body:** save money and use beef chuck instead of ribeyes/filets.  get an intact chuck roast from the butcher, not pre-cubed "beef for stew".  Cut the meat up yourself into small cubes.  Ribeyes are for grilling, or broiling, not stew.  The collagen breaks down nicely and the chuck meat transforms wonderfully. Of course, if you're wealthy, do as you wish.

There were too many onions for my taste, so I ended up scooping some out before I served it.  I used parsnips instead of potatoes, but other than that, stuck to the recipe. I will try it again and add some thyme, maybe up the red wine, caramelize the onions or roast the veggies in advance to add some depth.

The method is fine, but as others have mentioned, the dish lacks seasoning and depth. I had leftovers, so I upped the salt and added other flavors: one night, herbes de Provence; another, lots of thyme and black pepper. I added red wine and reheated over low heat to infuse the new flavors. The leftovers were better than the original, so if you make this recipe add your own personal touches.

- **Comment Body:** For really tender stew meat, you need big thick chuck roasts cut(trimming to remove sinews and silver skin) into 2"X 2" inch cubes, or close to it.  Cutting against or across the grain.  Never buy any meat labeled stew meat in a grocery store.  Do not brown.  Put meat in a heavy enameled cast iron pot into a 250-300 degree oven for 3-4 hours. Stir half way thru. Browning one inch chunks turns the meat into shoe leather.

I have found  that I like red potatoes better than bakers in the stew. Cooking the beef for an hour first makes all the difference because it just falls apart. Then the beef stew is perfect for this house.

I used Robert Mondavi Cabernet Sauvignon aged in bourbon barrels for under $13 with delicious results. Add 2T tomato paste. Another 3 minutes with the potatoes and mushrooms Another 2 minutes with carrots, squashes, spinach, and onions with spices, garlic, Italian seasonings. Add sauteed onions, frozen peas if desired when done

- **Comment Body:** Flouring the meat before browning thickens the stew; it also adds flavor. So does making the stew a day in advance of serving. We like our stew vegetables soft enough to mash slightly into the gravy, so I put carrots and potatoes in together and cook for an hour when beef is almost tender. If using pasture-raised beef, cooking time may be longer but the flavor is worth the wait. This is an excellent recipe, basically the stew I was raised on.

- **Comment Body:** Don't use "stewing beef".  It is a combination of different cuts of different sizes, the left- overs after the steaks and roasts have been trimmed.  I suggest buying a small roast or steak, like bottom round and cut it yourself into uniformly sized pieces. You know what you're getting and the price is the same.  Different cuts cook at different speeds and have different flavors.

- **Comment Body:** I have made this with the add-ons suggested (more broth, tomato paste, Worcestershire, thyme) and straight on. Both are wonderful. To get the vegetables to desired softness and stew to desired thickness, I extend cooking time by one hour on lowest possible simmer (covered dutch oven open just a crack). Do add carrots first and then potato a little later (if you like your potato tender but not melty). I find a whole onion is a lot and half is perfect. Liberally salt and pepper during last hour.

Then wilted 2 chopped onions and spices (1 T oregano, 1 tsp thyme, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, paprika, 3 bay leaves) in oil in the pan, then added 4 cups beef stock and 2 1/2 c Shiraz wine. Brought to a boil then added back the meat and drippings. Cooked for the 1 1/2 hours then added potatoes, carrots, and red top turnips. Salt to taste. Tastes great. Try it!

I ended up making e a roux at the end to thicken, and stirring in some caramelized onion from a jar to try to liven it up. I don't think I'd make it again, but if I did I would saute onion first, and add garlic as some suggested.

My only issue was that the broth was a bit too thin at the end of the cooking, so I thickened it with a slurry of seasoned flour and stock. That did the trick. I’ll definitely be adding this to my regular rotation.

- **Comment Body:** Almost any stew can be adapted to the slow cooker. I find it best to brown the meat first, then put everything together in the pot--but you don't really have to. Vegetables can cook the same amount of time as the meat. You may want to reduce liquid; there will be little to no evaporation. If you don't flour and brown the meat first, you may want to thicken the stew at the end. A flour & water or cornstarch & water slurry will do the trick--stir in and cook 1/2 hour longer.

This recipe reminds me of how she used to make it. Basic but comforting to come home from school to. We didn’t use lots of spices. Just good old salt and pepper. While there’s nothing wrong with adjusting to your taste, there’s no need to be negative. This is a basic recipe. Nothing fancy, just good old fashioned stew.

I cut the amount of potatoes in half so that I can scoop some of the pumpkin up with the stew as a starch.  It is always impressive when you take a pumpkin out of the oven, open the lid, then start serving from it!  Be sure to place the pumpkin in a deep baking pan in case you scrape the bottom layer too thin when hollowing the gourd and get a little leakage. This also keeps the pumpkin stable.  Enjoy!

I also cooked the meat longer than suggested and simmered longer than suggested to keep the meat tender!

- **Comment Body:** Taken from NYT article: "Mastering The Art Of Beef Stew"  The ideal accompaniment would be dry, intense and structured enough to stand up to the rich beef, but not powerfully fruity or oaky. A red from the Northern Rhône Valley, like a Cornas or a Hermitage. You could try an aged Barolo or Brunello di Montalcino, or older Bandol. A good cabernet sauvignon from the Santa Cruz Mountains or a restrained Napa cabernet.  ERIC ASIMOV

The secret is to use the saved broth/wine stock and use it again the second time around giving it a deeper flavor.

You simply add a bit more salt if you want to bring out the flavor more. Sometimes If I have time I let the meat cook a bit longer so it gets buttery soft and flakes apart. This recipe is exactly as advertised in the name. This is my favorite go to stew recipe, hands down.

Try it also with big-chunk smashed reds. I found that cutting potatoes into 3/4 inch cubes interferes with testing which red wine to serve with the beef stew.

- **Comment Body:** After browning the beef sauté the onions. Then add about 1 to 2 tablespoons of tomato paste and continue to cook until the color starts to go from bright red to rust. Then deglaze with the wine and vinegar. Add one tall spike of fresh rosemary (leaves removed and chopped) and three to four sprigs of thyme. Follow the recipe and finish with two cups of peas two to three minutes before serving.

- **Comment Body:** This is an easy (albeit somewhat time-consuming) recipe.  I think it's silly for people to comment by in effect providing a completely alternative recipe they like better - once you're adding more ingredients than there are in the original list, you're simply making something else.  Which is fine.  So make something else!

The best beef stew I’ve ever had. It really doesn’t need all the extras suggested in the comments - sometimes simplicity is beauty.

Consider adding a few sprigs of your favorite herbs and/or garlic and larger chucks of beef (remember they will shrink in 1/2) and also cut the carrots & potatoes larger to prevent them from tasting mushy, oily and overcooked.

I don't find the flavors too bland as some comments stated, although I accidentally made with regular beef broth (not low sodium) so I may have some more salt flavoring than the original. I am eating this with homemade rosemary rolls.

Also added a handful of quartered button mushrooms that I had sitting in the fridge (that I briefly sautéed before adding). Turned out pretty well, but it's missing something--I'm really trying to replicate my grandmother's stew, but haven't gotten it quite right yet.

- **Comment Body:** The dish could benefit from more flavor; without the red wine component, I imagine it couldn't be much better than a meal served on Wagon Train or The Rifleman. I recommend adding salt and pepper to your meat before coating it with flour to enhance the taste. Sautéing your vegetables, particularly the onion, instead of just adding them to the pot of liquid and meat - would help to bring out their unique flavors. Also, including Rosemary, Sage, or Thyme would improve this dish considerably.

I boil 15-20 small pearl onions for ten minutes with some salt before adding them the drained onions to the pot.  For peas, I add a bag of bright green frozen peas straight from the freezer and let the stew return to simmer; usually 5 minutes or so.

After reading the suggestions I did tweak the recipe a bit by adding tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce (a few dashes), oregano, thyme and fresh rosemary. I also am a fiend for garlic so I sautéed about 4 small cloves after the beef was done browning and before I added the wine and vinegar. I also made a slurry at the end to thicken it just a tad. I would suggest some good dipping bread smothered in butter to go with it!

I really think this makes it flavorful on its own.  2.  Used 2 onions and a bit more carrot (large instead of medium) just for personal preference.  3.  Added a bunch of garlic  4.  At the end added just a little swig of Worcestershire sauce and a teaspoon'ish of soy sauce.  5.  Finally, I thickened with a slurry of flour/water strained (it was fairly thin)

Don't waste the time doing the "as is", unless your taste buds haven't evolved since you migrated from Ireland in early 20th century. Instead, follow the suggestions in the comments: herbes de provence; tomato paste; shallot; garlic (extra); worcestershire sauce; thyme; peas; and balsamic vinegar. If you do those things, it comes out superb, balanced, and to-die-for.

- **Comment Body:** I like the background notes of a mirepoix, so I sweat that after deglazing the pan post browning the beef. To up the umami (and as a reflection of living in Australia!), I also add a bit of Vegemite and a splash of fish sauce, along with Worcestershire sauce as others have done.   As others have said, the beauty of the stew is such that this is a classic backbone of the recipe, and you can customise it any way you like.

- **Comment Body:** I sautéed the onions and carrots (with salt and pepper) prior to mixing with the beef.  I also let the stew boil with an open cover after the potatoes were added to allow it to reduce a bit.  Many people note a lack of flavor - I suspect it has a lot to do with the beef stock you choose to use.  The flour as others have noted chars during the browning of the beef and adds some flavors to the broth when it is deglazed.  It is classic beef stew and it was fabulous.

- **Comment Body:** This likely has been noted already (since there are over a thousand comments), but about 10 years ago, Cooks Illustrated pointed out that the addition of anchovy filets or paste gives stews like this the umami boost they generally lack.  And it works without imparting any fishiness.

- **Comment Body:** Or pour it all into the crock pot and let it cook on low all day!  So much easier!  Beef stew is the perfect crock pot meal.  Just brown the meat first and everything else goes in together, with a little tapioca or cornstarch to thicken the gravy.  I add a tablespoon of molassas to enhance the color, and a can of diced tomotos too.  I often frozen green beans for the last 30 minutes or so.

- **Comment Body:** Honestly, this stew was just okay. I definitely expected it to be a lot better based on all of the reviews. If it weren't for the red wine, though, it wouldn't have had much flavor. The potatoes need MUCH longer to cook and I would probably not use baker potatoes again. If I were to make this recipe again, I would definitely saute the onions first and probably add some herbes de provence. It's a good starter recipe though.

I used Robert Mondavi Cabernet Sauvignon aged in bourbon barrels for under $13 with delicious results.  Add 2T tomato paste.   Another 3 minutes with the potatoes and mushrooms   Another 2 minutes with carrots, squashes, spinach, and onions with spices, garlic, Italian seasonings. Add sauteed onions, frozen peas if desired when done

Came out extremely tasty and great to throw in the freezer for easy lunches and dinners during the work week. Thanks for the recipe!

We didn't have any beef broth in the pantry so I subbed it out with vegetable stock and seasoned it with some fennel, basil, seasoned salt, and rosemary. I also browned the beef in some bacon fat in a separate pan before adding it to the stew to simmer and it turned out fabulously.

I added dried porcini mushrooms, 1 lb of white mushrooms, browned, 2T Herbs de Provence as others have mentioned, and a bouquet garni of several twigs of thyme and 2 rosemary. I also used a full bodied ale instead of wine. The stew was a spiritual experience, so good. Served over noodles, with a slice of homemade Rosemary bread. I have enough to freeze for later in the cold weather.

- **Comment Body:** I did listen to comments especially the witty  PDeCo.  My recent "discovery" is the beautiful white turnip, which I add instead of potato.  With that substitution, the stew freezes nicely.  Because turnip is such a hard root vegetable, I add in quartered chunks 1/2 hour after the meat begins to simmer. Two cups of cubed butternut squash added along with the onions and carrot dissolves into the stew for a sweetened and thickened touch.  Finally, I have learned NOT to overcook my stew.

Added salt and put in the oven for almost 2 hours then added in veg as directed.

### Recipe: Old-Fashioned Beef Stew

- **Comment ID:** 128309989
- **User Display Name:** Diane
- **Comment Body:** This is pretty much how I make stew, all my now long life. I learned this from my mother, and she from her mother. The only thing I do differently, is to sauté the onions, plus garlic, in the beginning. They cook to almost nothing, and add so much flavor. I also add Herbs de Provence, which my mother never did. Winter comfort food.

- **Comment Body:** As well as the obligatory Carrots I always add Parsnip and Celeriac to my beef stews. Also a good tablespoon of Mixed Herbs adds a lovely back note to the flavour too. Basically a stew should be free reign to add what you like. In Staffordshire UK they call a stew ‘Lobby’. That’s because you lobbed in the pot whatever you had in stock!

Finely crush 6-8 gingersnaps and mix with a small amount of water. Add gradualy, and stir in,  will thicken as it simmers. Repeat if not  thick to your taste

- **Comment Body:** For those complaining about blandness, not everything is supposed to be like Thai food. This is comfort food and it's supposed to feel good around your tongue and down your throat. It's not bland it's just that it's not highly spicy. Don't go but leave it in your mouth for a few seconds to taste the different mold flavors of the potatoes carrots meat. You will find it's not as bland as you think.

No red wine, so used the broth instead.  Mistakenly used Balsamic Vinegar vs. red wine vinegar.  Very happy with results. Made for a delicious fond, along with some broth to deglaze the pan. Added some celery, as I had some fresh in the fridge.  Looking forward to making this again.

As for it keeping for 3 days, well, I guess technically it does, but it might be undrinkable by then: the longer it sits, the bitterer it gets. In Brazil, we make it and serve it, since no one likes "limonada azeda"!

Also, just as a curiosity, the sweetened condensed milk as a sweetener is something of a regional variation within Brazil. Most brazilians would tell you that the difference between regular lemonade vs "swiss" lemonade is squeezing the limes vs blending whole limes.

Because other reviewers said the lemon made it bitter, squeezed lemon juice over the entire pan before putting it in the oven. Also added a few chunks of lemon flesh, but avoided the pith/ peel. Truth be told, I looked at the ingredient list, barely read the recipe, and didn't measure anything, and it turned out great. This recipe is easy to riff off of and is very forgiving.

The vegetables were more steamed than roasted.  No browning or charring, just hot limp vegetables.  Feta was nice and warm.  I will try again but maybe spread it over two sheet pans, increase the temp, and perhaps crumble and sprinkle feta over it and broil for a few seconds.

### Recipe: Sheet Pan Baked Feta with Broccolini, Tomatoes and Lemon

- **Comment ID:** 108407960
- **User Display Name:** David
- **Comment Body:** We prepared this almost exactly per the instructions (used two small bunches of broccolini and ⅔ of a large red onion.  Delicious!  Next time I might follow the suggestion of others to use preserved lemon -- the lemon slices were still too tart and hard to really eat.  And it took a bit more time to cook than suggested.  Served over orzo.  Will definitely make again!

- **Comment Body:** Made this as close to the original recipe as possible - only subbing (pandemic adjustments) the broccolini with a mix of broccoli & cauliflower florets and some fresh green beans. Added a handful of kalamata olives too. Just a lovely, delicious, easy summer recipe. Very appreciated in this household!

- **Comment Body:** I see a lot of people made substitutions, which sound interesting and I might try next time, but I’m here to say that if you follow the recipe exactly it’s wonderful. However, if you are using this as your main course, with nothing else other than farro/orzo, it is enough for four people. Three, at most (two, if you’re greedy like me!).

- **Comment Body:** Made this with couscous and it was easy, quick and tasty! Truly a 30 minute meal. But I agree with others about the feta...unless you’re eating it right out of the oven the feta goes from soft and creamy to cold and solid. Next time I’ll crumble the feta unbaked right before serving to ensure some creaminess.

- **Comment Body:** We’ve made this after every grocery trip since it was first published, so about every two weeks during the pandemic. On the lemon debate, I add the slices to the sheet pan, then discard them before serving, but each plate gets a lemon quarter to squeeze over. I usually can’t help mucking around with recipes, but after at least a dozen outings I have yet to stray on this one.

- **Comment Body:** We’ve made this about 10 times now. I’ve made only 3 changes. (1) used thin skinned lemons (Meyers) or preserved lemons. (2) added sliced red peppers. (3) added more broccolini because we love it cooked this way. The basil adds nothing & costs too much. Don’t crowd the pan so everything can brown vs. steaming. And we’ve settled on roasted potatoes as the best side vs. grains.

Last night, I used broccoli, small fingerling potatoes cut in small triangles, cubed eggplant and Flavor Bomb cherry tomatoes. Along with spices, lemon slices, red onion and cilantro, I swapped dairy feta for Violife vegan feta.  All the spices remain the same.  The only difference is the vegan feta is placed on top of the vegetables after they have cooked and cooled for about 5 minutes to avoid melting.  Delicious

Second time, I subbed shrimp in for tomatoes (had shrimp to cook, ran out of tomatoes) and used broccolini. Ate this version over Bibb lettuce and YUM! This a no-fail, worth turning on the oven, kitchen staple, totally delicious, gorgeous, and filling meal. Keep the lemon, cumin, pepper flake, or basil, but everything else is riffable.

- **Comment Body:** This dish might benefit from roasting tomatoes separately then tossing in at the end. The tomatoes left a lot of liquid in the pan causing the onions & broccoli to get steamed versus browned. The extra time to brown things causes the feta to stiffen too much. A bit more research might improve this recipe.

Next time, I’ll use 2 blocks, as the feta added so much flavor & we have enough left for another dinner. I couldn't find Broccolini & used a big head of Broccoli instead. It worked out just as well. BTW...If you’re using Broccolini, I’d recommend using 2 bunches. I also didn't have basil, but it seemed to not matter, & used the entire lemon (sliced) on the pan. Served w/Orzo & crusty bread for dipping.

After 17 minutes, the vegetables and feta were perfect! The combination of flavors is incredible, and thinly-sliced sweet peppers added even more flavor and color. I can't wait to make this again!  By the way, I lined the sheet pan with heavy duty aluminum foil and didn't need to wash it afterward.

Something about the lemon slices and cumin combination really elevates the dish to taste much more complex than it was to cook. I can throw this together so quickly, and it's quick to clean up too, perfect for weeknights.  Pro tip -- use a larger baking tray than you think you need so that you don't crowd the pieces too much. If you find it getting crowded, split it up into 2 trays and rotate them halfway!

I then place on a cookie sheet (it makes enough for two cookie sheets), place the feta cheese throughout, and bake. I serve it with garlic bread

But this version is in its own class as the best of them all. It also helped me appreciate Nosrat's lessons about salt. She is a genius.  Best of all? It just tastes like chicken.

There was no sign of mushiness from the marinade, and the chicken was extremely tasty and juicy.  I roasted it on a rack set over a roasting pan in which I put some cut-up potatoes and carrots and a handful of whole, peeled shallots.  The chicken juices and the residual buttermilk gave the veggies a nice flavor as well.  I'll definitely make this again!

- **Comment Body:** Best roast chicken I’ve ever made/had/seen!! Prepared this according to Samin a few times now and I’ve learned 2 days marinating is better than 1. And if you like a very crispy chicken, I’ve refrained from turning the temp down until it had ~10 min of cooking time left.

### Recipe: Buttermilk-Brined Roast Chicken

- **User Display Name:** MarciaSF
- **Comment Body:** Easy enough and yielded a really moist chicken.  I don't know if it's significantly better than my go-to Zuni Cafe roast chicken recipe which uses a dry brine, but was interesting to try.  Do yourself a favor and line your pan with foil or make sure you've really scraped off most of the buttermilk.  What puddled in the pan beneath the chicken really burned and glued itself to the roasting pan.  Dish guy/husband was not thrilled.

- **Comment Body:** I've roasted many chickens but this is the best!  I stuffed the cavity with a small Meyer lemon. While the chicken rested after roasting, poured the pan juices into a fat separator then added chicken broth. Meanwhile deglazed the iron skillet with dry vermouth. Then added defatted juices and simmered until rich in color. Delicious.

- **Comment Body:** I've roasted a lot of chickens in my day, this one is now my go-to. A few years ago I was at the celebrated Le Coq Roti in Paris and had an amazing piece of chicken. I asked the waiter what the secret was to getting it so moist and flavourful and he said he could not divulge this information but then leaned over and whispered "buttermilk". 12 hours or more in the buttermilk is ideal but I've done it for as little as 6 and the results were still great.

We have just finished our 5th chicken prepared this way, and have 2 nice birds waiting in the freezer who will meet the same end.   I've roasted birds in the 5 lb range and just add a few minutes to each stage and check the temp at the end. We have twice let the bird go 2 days in the buttermilk, by happenstance, and they are just as good if not better.

- **Comment Body:** ** Safety Alert** In reference to comments regarding “leftover” buttermilk or marinade: If it’s the 2 cups that are “left over” from the quart you bought, yes. Use it for cake, biscuits, etc. But don’t use leftover marinade with raw chicken juices in it for anything. That's why you wash everything (with soap) after handling raw chicken. It will be on the pan, your spoon, your hands, etc.  And DON’T make ranch dressing  or biscuits with it. The word “leftover” was referring to 2 different things.

I recommend a salad situation on the side: extra buttermilk with herbs and pepper for the dressing, and toss old baguette cubes in the chicken fat and bake for the best croutons ever.  Toss with lots of fresh herbs, snap peas, lettuce.  Roast the chicken on top of radishes if you're feeling bougie. Such a banger. 10/10

- **Comment Body:** Added a homemade preserved lemon in the cavity, a bed of sliced onion under the chicken, and multicolored whole baby carrots on the sides. The flavors were outrageously good; white meat was the juiciest ever!  Baked in my shallow round le creuset; cleanup was a breeze.  I recommend watching the 4th episode of the chef’s Netflix series (salt fat acid heat) to see how she salts the bird before marinating. It seems like a lot but the final result was not salty.

She says if you have Morton's (blue canister), which is twice as salty by volume, you should use half as much (thus 1T in this recipe instead of 2). Would be nice if this recipe included that nuance! May be the reason some people are finding it too salty.

- **Comment Body:** Hi Alan, you can try using a pre-heated oven safe skillet (cast iron is a good choice). Put the skillet in the hot oven for 15-20 minutes to pre-heat, then take it out and place the chicken on the hot pan. (It should sizzle) Compared to putting the chicken in a cold roasting pan, this method gives a head start on cooking the dark meat and should give a more even result. Good luck!!

- **Comment Body:** Delicious.  The only (tiny) change I would suggest is to place two 3/4 inch slices of yellow onion in the skillet before placing the chicken on top of them.  The onion acts like a rack, allowing the oil to drip away, and gives a nice flavor to the oysters.  I've also done this with pieces of white bread - but I seldom have white bread, and brown bread is too sweet.

Makes the breast cooler so it does not cook quite as fast.  I've made a version of this before - buttermilk marinated chicken is a staple in the plains/southwest.  Easy, fun, and great for beginners as well as those who are more advanced cooks/chefs.

- **Comment Body:** PS to my previous note: Last two times I made this I dared a tiny tweak & stirred a tsp. of Ethiopian Berbere spice* into the buttermilk before marinating "da boid"--even better! *Readily available online, or use whatever combo of granulated garlic, ground ginger, "sweet"--not hot or smoked!--paprika, ground New Mexico chiles, etc., pleases you.

- **User Display Name:** Sue L
- **Comment Body:** This is--bar none--the only roast chicken method I'll ever need: It's infallible, whether you use a whole chicken and regular oven, a Cornish hen in the former or toaster-oven, or a poussin or chicken part of your choice* in toaster-oven. Unless you're a 100% novice, you needn't bother with all the oven-turning, although lowering the temp from 425 to 400° is fine. Just keep a watchful eye--and then gobble!  *Avoid breasts, though--even bone-in, skin-on, they'll dry out.

- **Comment Body:** This turned out so delicious.  I had rosemary and thyme, so added some of both under and over the skin.  I also added a couple of bay leaves inside the cavity.  I had neglected to salt the bird before dropping it in the buttermilk, so I tossed a bit of kosher salt and pepper over the top before I popped it into the oven, which actually added a little extra crunch to the skin.  Oh my god.  I can't wait to make this again.

And I agree there is definitely a food safety issue with using the marinade. Buttermilk is cheap and keeps for a long time in the fridge.

- **Comment Body:** I have cooked this chicken many times. A few points to consider (maybe already previously posted): Do NOT use table salt, it will be terribly salty. And keep in mind that most grocery store chickens have already been "plumped" with saline solution. I buy organic chickens which are much smaller-3-4 pounds, and they do cook faster-yep they look like little tweety birds. The skin is always beautiful although not crunchy, however the meat is perfect.

While the chicken is resting after roasting, pour the pan juices into a fat separator then added chicken broth. Meanwhile deglazed the iron skillet with dry vermouth. Then added defatted juices and simmered until rich in color. Delicious.

Anyway, the chicken did brown nicely, was tender and juicy, but the flavor underwhelmed me. I also did not like the flavor the buttermilk imparted. I will go back to the roasting method my Armenian grandmother taught me: salt, pepper on top and inside; paprika on top; celery, parsley, garlic inside; and basted with lots of butter.

- **Comment Body:** Using thighs? Marinate, then drain & dab while they come to room temp. Heat oven & cast iron pan to 425. Put the thighs in the pan & then pan in oven. Rotate pan & put into opposite corners every 10 minutes. Don't cook to internal temp, cook to skin crispiness - about 45 minutes. They come out 212 degrees or higher which is nuts but by some crazy magic, the chicken is juicy beyond description. During clean up, heat your pan and deglaze it to get as much of those magical juices as you can!

- **Comment Body:** No, but I would just use a vegan buttermilk recipe (I found several). I think it's basically lemon juice added to your favorite non dairy replacement (look up the ratio of xx milk to acid/lemon juice). I would think soy milk would be the most nutral. The acid in the lemon juice is what helps to tenderize the meat.

- **Comment Body:** Brilliant recipe.  Instant Pot question:  please don't.  This comes out super in your oven.  Rotating the pan as instructed gives more even browning.  As noted, the skin is irresistible to gobble down.  VERY tender and delicious chicken.  Oh:  I find it easier to use a 2-gallon Ziploc bag, and since I'm unlikely to use the rest of the buttermilk before it goes bad, I put the whole quart in the bag with the chicken and salt.

- **Comment Body:** If you've never roasted a chicken before, go ahead and follow this recipe. It's fine. Will it be the best roast chicken you'll ever make? Hardly. There's absolutely no difference in the taste of the skin because of the buttermilk; it's the 425 degree heat that makes it so crispy. If you want a recipe that doesn't use spices or a lot of work, this one will work. And FYI, there is no need to cut off the wing parts. Just put the whole thing in the marinade and oven.

Don’t know if others agree, but I found it richer than regular roast chicken, and thus more filling. Easy and luxurious. An A .

- **Comment Body:** I respectfully disagree... we raise chickens (freedom rangers which coincidentally free range graze) and this recipe is amazing with our chicken. So much that we give out this recipe, along with a basic dry salt brine for roasting, with our all of our chickens. The key in my opinion is to brine for the full 24 hours, and to liberally salt the skin before you put the chicken in the buttermilk.

- **Comment Body:** This recipe deserves all the 5 star ratings it has and more. Made as is, except only marinated for 12 hours instead of 24 (ran out of steam the night before and only prepped in the morning). The roasting positions are genius, yields the fall of the bone juicy dark meat while keeping the breast meat moist. This was my first time ever roasting a whole chicken and this recipe was incredibly easy to put together.

- **Comment Body:** I love this recipe. I put the chicken in the buttermilk the night before, and realized the next morning I had forgotten the salt! I added it to the bag, squished it around, and let it marinate for about seven hours. It still turned out great! I also tucked butter and rosemary under the skin and put half a lemon in the cavity, and the drippings made delicious gravy. This is a keeper.

- **Comment Body:** I took the suggestion of the person who said to lay thin slices of potato underneath - do it!  I used three large-ish pieces, 2 legs and a breast, and cooked to a temperature of almost 180, which was good (no pink meat).  I used the leftover juices to make a gravy by adding a bit of flour and then some heavy cream at the end.  I marinated for about 7 hours and it was great.

I scraped it off a few hours early and let it air out in the fridge starting at about noon, then took it out an hour before cooking as instructed. Came out absolutely delicious!

- **Comment Body:** If you pasteurize the used buttermilk before you bake with it, it’s fine.  Just heat it at 150 on the stovetop for 10 minutes or so, or scald it.  Either way.    Also, you can keep the leftover buttermilk and use it to batter fish or whatnot, or you can use it to make a tasty cream of potato soup.  Plenty of uses.

I used a cast iron skillet, but didn’t preheat it - no smoke detectors were harmed in the roasting of this chicken. This is hands down the easiest, moistest chicken - browns and crisps wonderfully, and leaves a lovely residual schmaltzy buttermilk gravy all on its own. I only had 8 hours to marinate, and it was lovely.

They were still good, but not as delicious as the 4lb \-.  Also, use full fat buttermilk. used full and light - the full is tastier and, let’s be honest, you’re eating the skin anyway, so just live your best life.

Measure for measure, Morton’s Coarse kosher salt contains more salt than does the Diamond Crystal kosher salt brand.   According to 177MilkStreet.com, 1 teaspoon of Morton’s = 4.8 grams of salt, whereas 1 teaspoon Diamond = 2.8 grams.

I salted & rested for 30 minutes before putting in the buttermilk brine for about 24 hours, taking from the fridge an hour before, & then roasting - I used my roasting pan instead of a skillet so I did not orient the chicken quite like the instructions. What I did not think about was the flavor. While this is good, it could use the addition of garlic or herbs as others have suggested. Will make it again.

I can't say it was appreciably better then just roasting the fresh chicken with a rub of olive oil and herbs (and using the buttermilk for something else).  Maybe I'll try the buttermilk brine again sometime with a lesser chicken.

- **Comment Body:** I'm not an experienced cook.  I followed the recipe exactly, but instead of the last 30 minute cooking time I removed the chicken from the oven at the 20 minute mark.  An instant read thermometer placed in the breast meat gave a temp of 185.  Despite the high breast temperature, the breast meat was moist and delicious when eaten.  However the drumsticks and thighs were pink. I obviously should have cooked it longer and not have been concerned myself with the breast temp.  Any suggestions?

I love a simple dry brine with salt and sugar, letting the bird dry out for 24 hours and then tucking in some herbs and rubbing with a little butter or olive oil; this method consistently makes a flavorful and moist bird. But, I thought I would give this a go given the rave reviews. This buttermilk roast chicken was definitely moist, but I didn't find there to be great depth of flavor.

I flipped it a few times and followed the recipe as instructed and it was perfect- my only note is that it took another 30 minutes to get it to 160 degrees. Sitting out for 30 it cooked the rest to 165. I used a 7 lb Capon. My mother can't tolerate salt so I used half of what was called for and still found it very tender and salty.

Reduced the amount added to buttermilk to 1T.)  I used my shallow, round LeCreuset pan.  I put it in the half to heat for a half hour before adding the chicken.  The chicken was beautifully browned, very moist.  Great recipe.  Thanks to Samin Nosrat!

- **Comment Body:** whoa, you are going to have so much fat, but I'll bet it would be delicious...just roast it in a pan with sides to hold the fat that will render.  Good luck!  I would look up roasting times for a duck and see if they coincide.

- **Comment Body:** Re failure to brown:  Try using the Convection setting.  If you do, Use 400 degrees, not 425 degrees, and check temps sooner in case you have to shorten cooking time, often an issue when using Convection setting.   Good Luck!

- **Comment Body:** Kate's makes real buttermilk.Needs to be an article by a food scientist comparing the cultured version to the real version. Has to be different in the acid content and effect in cooking/baking. Your comment -which my mom also recalls- "buttermilk was sweet...", makes one think it is was not acidic; so would it work as we all expect buttermilk to? Kate's is assertive and acidic, would not be possible to drink as you recall doing. Someone needs to do some splainin'!

Better results with my "Lemon Can Chicken", ala Stephen Rachlin, but with lemon juice instead of beer, no marinating, same tenderness, much more flavor.

Buttermilk straight from the carton for the biscuits would be better. I'm not worried about any bacteria surviving the gravy making process -- they won't.

Oven at 425 with cast iron pan in to pre-heat.  Shook off buttermilk.  Put pan on stove on medium and cooked skin side down for 3ish-4ish minutes just to crisp skin a bit.  Flipped it over.  Pepper on top and herbes de provence.  In the oven.  Our power went out and I over-cooked a bit but still moist and great-tasting.  A keeper, easy, and adaptable.

As others have noted, it does not result in a crispy skin, but for me, the taste and tenderness of the meat more than compensates for this.

- **Comment Body:** I didn't use any salt (I use little salt in general). The buttermilk gave the chicken a wonderful texture. Browned well. Next time I'll add spices -- maybe sage.  Small chickens are available in my area from farmer's markets. They eat in the fields, not grain fed. The source of chicken might have contributed to the success of the recipe -- these outdoor, grass-fed chickens are very lean with a good (stronger than usual) taste. Will surely make this again. I liked it!

Samin’s buttermilk chicken has been the height of our meals since the shut down — the appearance as it comes out of the oven deeply golden, every part cooked perfectly — moist and full of flavor. We raise our own roasting chickens each summer and last eve cooked up our biggest,  a 6 1/4 pounder. Thanks for making this time a little less harsh!

If you want something amazingly flavorful please try Colu Henry's Roast Chicken With Maple Butter and Rosemary here, Bittman's Simplest Roast Chicken (also here) or Ina Garten's Perfect Roast Chicken.

I’m one of those cooks who usually can’t resist adding my own touches, (worked as a chef for 35 years) but, I followed others advice and didn’t succumb to the temptation. So interesting the instructions for oven positioning. After eating BOTH wings, the rest went into chicken and dumplings, enriched by the beautiful broth made from the carcass.  Really can’t say enough about how good this is.

Took it out at 160 and it rose to 165 while resting. Perfectly moist, done, and delicious. I roasted in a Pyrex pan so clean up was easy. I added a few potatoes in 1 inch cubs at the start scattered around the bird. They were so delicious. I poured the pan juices into a bowl to spoon over chicken and potatoes.

We'll definitely be adding this recipe to the fold!

The simplicity of the ingredients hide the fact that the end result is AMAZINGLY juicy, tender, well-seasoned chicken with earth shatteringly crisp skin that is to die for. Honestly it reminded me of rotisserie chicken.   One thing I will say is that we spatchcocked the chicken after marinating and it didn't necessarily reduce the cook time but gave us really good results.

Is there anything I can do with the buttermilk/salt/poultry effluvia? Seems a shame to rinse it down the sink.

- **Comment Body:** They are good but nothing to rave about. I might look for higher quality toasted sesame oil if I make these again. I did NOT add the oil to the mix, just greased the glass pan and toasted seeds. My standard receipe uses vanilla extract but not this one, so i used 16 oz of large marshmellows instead of the 12 oz this mix calls for. Also, the plastic bag the cereal comes in makes a great nonstick surface to press down the warm mix into a pan. Just cut it into a large square

- **Comment Body:** If you up the recipe by 1/3, you can use a whole 16oz bag of marshmallows (the bags I found only came in 10 or 16oz). This also uses close to the whole box of Rice Krispies and a whole stick of butter.   This makes a great amount for a group as you can make it in a rectangular pan (like a 13x9) instead of the square one. I used a glass one I had with a lid, and it was perfect.

- **Comment Body:** Very good. Had to substitute spinach for arugula and am eager to try when I have arugula. Otherwise all worked well according to the recipe. I have a tip for the dill: you can freeze fresh dill. Just snip it as you would for a recipe and spread on a sheet of plastic wrap, with wide margins. Roll the plastic up like a jelly roll and close the ends with twist ties. It's easy to remove just what you need for a dish.  It's almost as good as fresh and certainly better than dried.

I also use baby spinach in place of arugula. Throw it UNDER the chicken & potatoes after you take the pan out of the oven and it just wilts and absorbs the marinade and chicken juices. Mmm.

- **Comment Body:** Have made this wonderful recipe many times. I always seem to find another little tweak for it every time I make it. One thing that's good is to mix about a tablespoon of chopped dill into the garlic yogurt sauce and add a good squeeze of lemon juice. I always use Greek yogurt because there is no reason not to that I can discern, and it's the only kind of yogurt I have at hand. I serve this yogurt/garlic/dill sauce on the side rather than spoon it over the crispy chicken skin.

- **Comment Body:** Sublime! I substituted a baking sheet for a sheet pan. The lack of a ridge on the sheet meant that oil dripped to the bottom of the oven, causing a grease fire which I extinguished with 2.5 to 3 cups of water (this amount may vary based on the size of your oven and the intensity of the fire). I found that the fire added a delightful smokiness to the potatoes while the water used to extinguish it created steam in the oven, resulting in deliciously moist chicken. Would recommend!

However, on the second occasion I made some adjustments: I used a combination of skinless, boneless breasts and thighs. I used medium potatoes, and cut them into wedges (eighths), which made it easy to arrange the potatoes around the chicken. (The wedges also crisped and browned nicely, which was harder to achieve with potato slices.) And I added the dill and lemon juice to the garlicky yogurt. Easy, delicious, impressive--a winner!

I used 12 oz of arugula and spread it as a serving bed for the potatoes, leeks and chicken.  The pan drippings made a nice dressing for the greens.  The yogurt sauce could also be doubled or tripled.  1/3 cup over 4 servings is only one heaping tbsp each.  I added some dill to the sauce.With 2 tbsp of harissa this was quite spicy, but we loved it.

Based on all the comments, I 1) divided the recipe between two sheet pans for nice browning and crisping, 2) added the leeks when there were about 15 minutes left, 3) added some dill and lemon juice to the delicious yogurt sauce (perfect accompaniment), 4) served the chicken and potatoes on top of the arugula.

- **Comment Body:** I had only a harissa spice blend from the excellent World Spice here in Seattle. I tossed a couple of tablespoons of that with some kosher salt over the chicken thighs in the morning and let them dry out in the fridge all day. I think the dry spices plus the drying out in the fridge made the chicken skin extra crispy. Also aggressively spacing the ingredients in the sheet pan. I used two to ensure crisping and browning. This is a perfect recipe. We all loved it.

I took others' advice and put the leeks on during the last 20" (as well as the fresh spinach).I chopped up cucumber, the dill and good kosher salt with the yogurt -- and made LOTS of it.Thus is a great recipe!

I wanted more sauce, so used a 6-oz. container of yogurt and 2 garlic cloves; I also added some dill to the sauce. The leeks got too browned, so I now add them about 15-20 minutes before the dish is done. Dish also works just fine with breasts. I used srirachi (nice and spicy); want to try it with David Tanis's recipe for harissa next time.

- **Comment Body:** Amazing flavor, but the potatoes were so limp and absorbed so much of the chicken fat that I found them unpleasantly unctuous (and I roasted them an extra 15 minutes). I'll definitely try this again (maybe even this week), but I'm inclined to turn it into a two pan recipe by roasting the potatoes on a separate sheet and adding a tbsp or two of the chicken fat at some point to get that wonderful depth.

I have used thigh/leg quarters on a per person basis which seems to come out about right.  It does need to be cooked a bit longer than stated altho with a convection oven the time is more accurate.  For those who don't like this much heat, use jarred chili sauce and drain before placing on the baking pan.  I also served it atop the arugula to let the chicken juices flavor the dish.

I like spice so I added an extra 2 tbs of harissa.  I also added more cumin, I used at least 1 teaspoon.  Do not crowd chicken if you want crispy potatoes.  I  only marinated for 30 min and was happy with results.  I would consider using sweet potatoes instead of potatoes for nutritional value.  I would also add a few cloves of roughly chopped garlic with the leeks.

Also used convection setting and cooked for 15 min, tossed potatoes, then 20 minutes more.  2-3 people.  (We were 2 but ate all because it was so good!)

Tonight I cut potatoes in chunks, boiled 5 minutes then drained and set aside. The recipe calls for roasting chicken pieces 15 minutes, then adding the prepared leeks. At this time I lightly tossed the potatoes with a bit of oil and also added them as well. All roasted another 30 minutes. End result was much improved and worth the extra step with the potatoes.

I also added a liberal amount of sweet paprika to everything, which added both color and punch.

- **Comment Body:** I followed ALL of the tips: Put arugula under the chicken so it coats with pan juices; add 1 tbsp chopped dill, squeeze of lemon and some zest to greek yoghurt and serve it on the side; add leeks in last 15 minutes, stirring them into the bottom so they don't blacken. I use sriracha, but have cooked it without for the heat-intolerant. Either way is good. I agree the chicken weight is off or I am using hugely muscular chicken thighs. Six for 4 people. No need to adjust other amounts.

- **Comment Body:** we love savory with sweet, so I used yams instead of yukon golds. also, I marinated the chicken overnight w/a combination of harissa, plain yogurt and a mediterranean spice mix (cumin, garlic, sumac, urfa, dill, spearmint & lemon). After reading others' reviews I made the following adjustments as well: marinated chicken, not the yams; roasted starch & chicken on two pans; started the yams 15 minutes before the chicken, added the leeks 20 minutes before the chicken was done. we devoured it!

- **Comment Body:** This is the second time making this recipe and it was even better this time.  I put the chicken, potatoes and leeks on the bed of arugula and dill, and sprinkled the whole thing with the o.o. and lemon, and served the yogurt/garlic mixture on the side.  It was a total winner at our dinner party. Can't wait to do it again.

- **Comment Body:** I've made this now about 5 times, and usually just remember to start the marinade 30 minutes before. It's always wonderful- the combination of the chicken and potatoes in the intense sauce, with the leeks, arugula and yogurt on top tastes so complete. Tonight, it was with roasted cauliflower and roasted cubed rutabaga, which worked well with the intense flavors of the harisa and cumin.. this is a real keeper.

- **Comment Body:** Doubled the recipe excepting the yogurt saice which I tripled. Do not marinate the potatoes, toss them with extra harissa sauce just prior to cooking. Extend the cooking time by ~5 minutes. As others suggest, add the leeks in the last twenty minutes, put the dill in the yogurt sauce, add sweet potatoes along with the regular potatoes, and serve it on the fresh arugala after cooking (OK so it's a 2 dish meal). Was enough for six people with a couple of lunches left over. Delicious and easy.

- **Comment Body:** I made this with skinless, boneless chicken thighs and siracha and it was very good. Next time around I will reduce the amount of potatoes (a bit too heavy) and increase the leeks, lemon zest, and yogurt sauce which is delicious. I'll also cut the potatoes smaller - while they cooked through, they were not at all crispy. House smelled great though!

- **Comment Body:** I was so excited to make this this week and was NOT disappointed.  I couldn't get fresh Dill so I left that out. I also somehow lost my sheet pan (seriously.. only me) and used a roasting pan. STILL delicious. The yogurt sauce is magical. I doubled the marinade and I also doubled the yogurt sauce and subbed in sriracha instead of harissa. This is definitely a show stopper. Great for a dinner party and actually fairly affordable. I used a large pack of chicken thighs.  Amazing. Thank you NYT

- **Comment Body:** I was blown away by this recipe and have made it many times since.  So easy to make but also such great flavors (the lemon zest in the leeks- so good!).  I follow it pretty much to the letter and have almost no issues.  If you put the pan too high up in the oven the leeks start to burn, but moving them around once or twice does the trick.  The first time I made this I lived in a smaller town and couldn't find harissa.  Sriracha was NOT as good- a little too vinegar forward.

I eat a lot of chicken, and have been trying new recipes for the variety. I used bone-in, skin on breasts, and sriracha instead of Harissa. Instead of serving it in the pan, I deboned the chicken into bite sized pieces and made a chicken salad of sorts using the yogurt and arugula/dill mixture.

- **Comment Body:** I was also confused about that, so I just pushed the potatoes around a bit.  I did not put the chicken above the potatoes.  I found the same recipe, credited to Melissa,  in a google search on a non-NYT site, and the directions said to cut the potatoes in 1.5" chunks, instead of slicing them, which worked better.  I think slices would have overcooked.

- **Comment Body:** I never write reviews, but this dish is so good and so reliable that it warrants one. I marinate the chicken and potatoes for about an hour, draining the excess liquid before placing them on the sheet pan. I agree with other commenters who suggest using the arugula as a bed on a serving platter and spooning everything else on top, so the leaves gently wilt. I like to stir in some lemon juice to my yogurt sauce, but to each their own. If I could give this 10 stars, I would.

Just turned the leftovers into a lunch salad: I dressed the remaining bunch of arugula with a vinaigrette of olive oil, champagne vinegar and pomegranate molasses. Then piled the potatoes, chicken, leeks, and yogurt sauce on top.   The sweetness of the pomegranate molasses brightened it up. Will make extras for next time too.

Rarely do I make the yogurt sauce (though it is delicious), I don’t usually add the dill (though also delicious), I like it better sans cumin. Sometimes we add carrots along with the potatoes for a more complete meal. One tip - when adding the leeks make sure they’re on the pan instead of on the chicken. They are amazing when caramelize in the drippings.

Each time I’ve had to take the chicken off to prevent overcooking and let the potatoes continue. I’ve also added chunks of red onion and/or zucchini slices to this which were great additions. I have made it thrice because it is fantastic and the result greater than the sum of its parts.

I'll be playing with that for some time to come.If you have whole cumin seed in your pantry, it's definitely worth the little bit of extra effort to freshly toast and coarsely grind some for this recipe. You can safely increase the amount of cumin if you do this. Freshly toasted cumin is so mellow and sweet!

- **Comment Body:** Simply outstanding. I used whole legs which made a nice "fancy" presentation. Also, instead of ground cumin, I used whole cumin seeds which gave it a slightly nutty + exotic flavor.  I also ended up taking the arugula back off the top and tossing it in the bowl I'd used for the leeks to pick up all the leftover bits. I then served the chicken and potatoes on top of the arugula salad so it got all nice and wilted.   I could make this daily and die happy. Thanks Melissa Clark!

But we find that using bone-in thighs with skin makes a huge difference...from really good (using boneless, skinless thighs) to absolutely fantastic! The chicken skin provides fat that makes the potato slices extra crispy and flavorful. Well worth the extra calories.

- **Comment Body:** Great recipe. I don't like a pure yogurt so I substituted with Melissa Clark's tahini yogurt sauce from a lamb meatball recipe. It was a perfect compliment to the harissa.

- **Comment Body:** I just made this for friends, and it was outstanding. It was very easy to make earlier in the day, and then simple to bake while we were enjoying wine before dinner. I served the chicken and potatoes over the arugula, and all the flavors came together very nicely. I made 4 1/2 pounds of chicken and 4x the marinade recipe, I used Greek yogurt but cut it with some milk, and it was a really bright, flavorful meal. I'll definitely make this one again

- **Comment Body:** I have made this several times and this recipe is a keeper. I use Sriracha and put the chicken in a bag with the honey, olive oil and cumin. I do not put the potatoes in the Sriracha marinade. It has a nice, easy kick and the sauce provided a good balance. I do not have good luck finding leeks so I roast regular onions with the potatoes. I have let the chicken sit much longer than 8 hours and it was still delicious. My partner loved the sauce.

- **Comment Body:** I love this recipe! I use Trader Joe's Harissa, and season and cook the potatoes (I add brussel sprouts) separately. I also make a tzatziki sauce to go with it, but the yogurt sauce listed here is great too if you want a lighter flavor. I like to finish it off in the broiler for an extra char. I followed the others' recommendations and plated the hot food on top of the arugula, so it was perfectly wilted. A quick and easy recipe that I'll surely make again.

- **Comment Body:** Great recipe. My personal preferences / adjustments were: - grating the garlic seemed unnecessary - easier to mince or make a paste in a hand blender and mix it in. I’d also use more garlic (3 cloves) if you want the yogurt flavor to be less yogurty - less oil - not sure why all that is necessary, skip it as a drizzle too - just use lemon juice - again, no need to grate - chicken amount seemed odd so I just went with what I had and adjusted the other ingredients accordingly - use more sriracha

Used chopped boneless skinless chicken breast-- briefly marinated-- and used Greek yogurt thinned with lemon juice as the finisher (raw garlic is a non starter here). Just harissa potatoes and lemon yogurt is a winner. Next time I'd roast potatoes for 15 min before adding chopped chicken breast and leeks.

- **Comment Body:** My mods added to effort, but worth it, imo...  whenever I do chicken thighs I “pre-braise” at 300 degrees, covered, for about an hour.  Otherwise they’re never done to my liking.  Anyway, did that with the marinated thighs, then separated the juices from the rendered fat and tossed the potatoes with the fat and roasted them separately.  I used the juices to baste the thighs and leeks.  When potatoes were browned, added them to thigh/leek pan to finish the process.

- **Comment Body:** Excellent recipe!! I had arugula in the fridge that needed to be used, and not much kitchen time. Used sliced shallots & onion (no leeks on hand) and dried dill (same reason). Used sriacha instead of harissa. Otherwise, followed the recipe. Next time, I'll be sure to use fresh dill and try the harissa (with luck it will keep forever like sriacha?). My favorite Bulgarian-style yogurt (White Mountain) was perfect - just enough tang. Delicious!!

I used chicken breast instead of thighs (just had them on hand)- 425 for about 25 minutes, adding the sliced leeks around the 10 minute mark. Made my own harissa paste (harissa powder plus olive oil and garlic). Served on top of the arugula with the yogurt sauce (extra garlic, no dill (store was out) and I used Greek yogurt), squeezed a bit of fresh lemon. This is going in our regular rotation.

Followed other reviewers and added lemon juice and dill to the yogurt sauce (used plain greek yogurt). Also added some smashed garlic cloves in with the leeks. Total cook time for me (with a mix of thighs and drumsticks) was 40 minutes. Did just chicken and potatoes for 30, added the leeks+garlic for the last 10. Serve everything over bed of arugula. Will make again!

The easy garlic sauce is the chef's kiss of the dish. Used gochujang instead of harissa because the tub was staring at me, bereft, from the refrigerator shelf. I heated the sheet pan before adding the potatoes (put in the potatoes 10 minutes before, thanks all) and they got nicely crispy. Also followed others in putting in the leeks 15 minutes before.

I took the suggestion of some other readers and put the baby spinach under the chicken at the end, also mixed the lemon and dill directly into the yogurt (served on the side), and put the potatoes in at the end of the marinade. I used tiny little new potatoes, so did not need to slice or wedge -- perfect!

I put the leeks in for 15 minutes at the end; they were soft and still had lots of flavor, not overcooked. I seasoned the yogurt with dill and lemon. This is a perfect, casual, dinner party option.

Next time I honestly might just use only fennel and have a baked potato for the side if I'm craving a potato. While the potato was great in the dish, the fennel had this wonderful artichoke like texture and nice nuttiness. I also chopped up the fennel tops and blended them into the yogurt as a sub for dill.

I used the chicken cilantro mini wontons from Trader Joe’s. It was delicious. It is a great way to use up leftover or slightly past due tomatoes and basil. It also is one of the juiciest meals ever. It made an exquisite “sauce” that was designed to be sopped up with good bread. Long live the juice.

It is a mildly spicy, oil-based condiment that is deep red and contains chile pieces, Szechuan peppercorns, and scallion cooked until deeply savory.  It adds a hit of umami and heat.  Note Lao Gan Ma brand carries many different sauces: Spicy Chili Crisp is what you seek.

### Recipe: Dumpling Tomato Salad with Chile Crisp Vinaigrette

- **User Display Name:** Mahiwema
- **Comment Body:** I made this the other night, when I had almost no energy left to think about dinner. It was very good, and so easy. Next time I’ll dial back the chili crisp, and maybe add a chopped up peach. Peaches go well with tomatoes and basil, and they’d add a nice sweet element to the dish.

I bought veggie dumplings at Trader Joes as others recommended and because I didn't have time to make a 40 mile round trip to HMart, which would have been my preference. I made my own chili crisp, which was great. Nothing negative about this recipe. I will note that if you're not going to eat the entire dish at one time to leave the dumplings out as they will get soggy sitting in the dressing.

On my second try I substituted Doubanjiang for the chili crisp because I dislike chili crisp’s gritty texture. I also wanted it to be more like a salad so I let the dumplings cool before tossing with tomatoes, crunchy romaine, cucumber and a bit of cilantro along with the basil. I highly recommend Bibigo chicken cilantro wantons for this recipe.  They can be found at Costco.

- **Comment Body:** This was just a bougie version of dumplings that we eat all the time, at home and at restaurants, here in Japan and probably throughout most of Asia. The "vinaigrette" is literally a combination of the things you see on any ramen shop counter; everyone eats their dumplings with a combination of soy sauce, vinegar, and chili oil (though typically just straight oil, no crunchy bits). All this recipe did was eliminate a second plate for a salad!

Don't set aside tomatoes for long, if at all, because you will have a soup. If there is a next time  for me I will steam the dumplings/pot stickers first and they can cool down. Then cut up tomatoes and quite immediately add the dumplings and wash all with  the dressing.

- **Comment Body:** As I've mentioned in previous NYT Lasagna recipes, a great hack for the lasagna pasta is simply placing the noodles in a large deep tray and pouring hot tap water over them.  Leave them immersed for ten minutes, every so often re-distributing them from top to bottom.  The result is perfectly pliable, undamaged noodles, ready for assembly in your lasagna pan, or the same tray you used for the hot tap water bath.  A great hack.

While the onions cook down, they leave an underlying flavor that we found unpleasant. The béchamel is a lot of work and calories without much extra flavor. Overall, with all the cheese and dairy, I expected this to taste more indulgent than it did. Homemade noodles turned out well and I liked the ricotta mix. Overall, 5 hours of work and kind of disappointing.

I ended using all the bechamel sauce, all the tomato sauce, and about 3/4's of the ricotta mixture. The result was delicious, but a bit too dry. Needs more tomato sauce in my opinion. Otherwise, a great, albeit time-consuming, recipe for anyone willing to make the effort.

It would be helpful if, first, the oven temperature is noted up top so it's not a scavenger hunt to find it. And second, this note, found in step 15, came too late--"If using store-bought or dried pasta, you can skip the noodle layer between the ricotta and tomato sauce as needed to prevent the lasagna from stretching higher than the top of the pan."

The lasagna only had four layers but it was enough.  I used imported dry lasagna noodles and frozen chopped spinach.  I added an egg to the ricotta mixture because it seemed very dry.  I used more sauce than suggested because we like it saucy. I think the secret ingredient is the bechemal. The end result was a rich, juicy, cheesy lasagna.   This recipe is a keeper!!!

If you're going to assemble it but not bake it, I would assemble it on Mother's Day Eve (after dinner) to go in the oven the following day for lunch. If you're going to make it ahead of time the no-boil noodles should do well since they'll have extra time to soak up liquid.

I used no boil noodles and the suggestion of another reader softening the pasta on my cookie sheet adding boiling water for 10 minutes or so. Also used a jar of Raos' marinara instead of making my own. Added the nutmeg which was delicious. My pan while 13 X 9 is not deep enough, had to order a deeper pan to experience all the pasta layers for next time. Superb

### Recipe: The Big Lasagna

- **Comment ID:** 106784586
- **User Display Name:** jessica
- **Comment Body:** First, I would encourage people planning to make this recipe to READ THE INSTRUCTIONS multiple times, especially if you're making your own noodles.  There are many steps!  I made it last night and the only things I did differently were to use wild ramps in place of the spinach and herbs (we already did our weekly shopping) and I ended up using 48 oz of sauce.  This lasagna was really good, but it was (I thought) very labor intensive, while not as mind blowing as I was expecting.

We were going to order something (can't remember what), but then we noticed that *every single person* who came in to eat there or take out was ordering the lasagna, so of course we ordered it too. It was by far the best lasagna either of us had ever had. I tried to ask what was in it that made it so good, but I spoke no Italian and the chef spoke no English.  The one word I understood was, "Besciamella."

- **Comment Body:** This recipe was a hit! I made every component according to the recipe and the end result was delicious. I highly recommend making the fresh pasta - the noodles are so much better than store-bought. I do recommend getting a head start the day before by making the tomato sauce, ricotta mixture and béchamel. Taste and season each component as suggested. I added a few more fresh herbs from the garden, including oregano to the tomato sauce and basil, Italian parsley and thyme to the ricotta mixture.

- **Comment Body:** This is an interesting combination of southern style ("Neapolitan") lasagna and northern style ("Bolognese") style. It has the besciamella of the north and the ricotta filling of the south. I make something very similar but with mozzarella instead of besciamella, which is how it's usually done in Campania. I made this as a vegetarian alternative for a dinner party a few years ago and it was a huge hit. I had two meat eaters arguing over who got to take the left-overs!

- **Comment Body:** I never leave reviews because who cares about my opinion, but you do today.  this is the best lasagna I've ever had. I think the people who are saying it doesn't have flavor are doing two things wrong. First, use fresh spinach. I know the recipe says you can use frozen but it doesn't have the same flavor. Use fresh and salt that bbb.  Second, salt as you go. The béchamel especially needs to be salted every  layer. The ricotta could use a dash of salt for each layer to.

- **Comment Body:** I combined some of the layers, even using a lasagna pan with high sides, as using dry noodles.  Combined ricotta and marinara layers, eliminated final Bechamel layered in pasta, and just placed the remaining Bechamel on top (as instructed).  I made the ricotta mixture, Bechamel, and marinara the day before.  I would not recommend making the Bechamel in advance. Trying to bring it back to a workable consistency was very difficult.  Great lasagna but definitely would half the recipe next time.

Great skillets, but note, if you find one, due to the selection of the teak handle, you cannot put them into the oven.  My father was an industrial designer and designed/started Copco.

I had to make 2 batches for crowd I was feeding - first one used 6 T butter, second batch 4T. Four was plenty. Used balsamic instead of honey. Will make again and again !

My wife - hates "cabbage-y" things - was astonished by how good it was. In my family, this counts as a success.  However: - This took much more than 20 minutes, more like 40. - I rounded up on the portions (I live in Europe and buy in grams). Nonetheless, there weren't any leftovers. Feeds four? Feeds two adults and two toddlers. Well.

Don’t skimp on the lemon zest and don’t be afraid of some bigger chunks of it after chopping — fried in the butter and honey they are a delightful contrast to the rest of the dish. Don’t overdo the Parmesan at the end, a light sprinkle does the job.

Next time I would double the Brussels sprouts and roast them instead of frying (my pan isn't big enough to properly fry that many sprouts!), try reducing the amount of butter by half (there was so much butter pooled at the bottom of my bowl when we finished it off!), then add the roasted sprouts into the pan to toss with the gnocchi at the very end. We didn't add the Parm because I was lazy and didn't bring it to the table, and didn't miss it one bit!

I follow the recipe exactly, with the exception of the steaming. Peppery goodness!

Cover skillet, put on med-hi heat for 5 minutes. Uncover and cook 2-3 minutes longer. Fullproof and creates sprouts that are browned on the cut side and green on the outside.

I love the texture the little gnocchi pellets (I use the shelf-stable ones) get after crisping up in the oil and bathing in the brown butter. My Brussels sprouts were enormous, so I cut them in half as directed during the searing step to maximize surface area, then chopped them into bite-sized pieces while the gnocchi cooked. I also like to add a small squeeze of lemon just before serving for acid.

I zested the whole lemon but only added 1 TBSP of zest and you couldn't really taste it.  Next time I will add more

- **Comment Body:** Recipe is great, though I find I can get away with about half the butter (I love me some butter, but the dish feels a bit greasy with the full amount). Though frying the gnocchi dry is delicious, I also like steaming the gnocchi with a splash of water for 1-2min after tossing them into the skillet. This allows them to plump a bit (stretching the package a little farther!) and get fluffy in the centers before you crisp the exterior.

### Recipe: Crisp Gnocchi with Brussels Sprouts and Brown Butter

- **Comment ID:** 105347544
- **User Display Name:** Liz
- **Comment Body:** Absolutely delightful. Browning the sprouts, gnocchi (I used Target shelf-stable mini gnocchi), and butter all took a little longer than stated, but I just watched the color and let them have the time they needed. Still very doable on a weeknight. It looks like a ton of butter when first added, but evaporation and absorption of the gnocchi took care of it. The finished dish is so good. Rich, crispy-chewy gnocchi and bright, browned sprouts. Added a teeny squeeze of lemon. Will make again!!

- **Comment Body:** Revelation - gnocchi can be crisped in the oven! Did this because I wanted to double recipe and crisp them all at same time. Put them and Brussels sprouts on baking sheet in oven, flipped the gnocchi and crisped on both sides.  Them finished recipe in pan.  Added the balsamic and it was delicious.

- **Comment Body:** So love this recipe, it has become a family favorite even though I have made some adjustments. We now cook the brussels sprouts in 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 2 tablespoons of butter and season. Once they’re sufficiently brown on one side we remove them and place them on an aluminum lined pan in oven at 4:25. And we continue to cook the gnocchi in the pan with remaining ingredients to sufficiently crisps and combine the two. We find it uses less fat and taste just as delicious!

Trader Joe’s frozen cauliflower gnocchi browned nicely in the skillet, without any water ( the package calls for water but this recipe does not - will never incorporate water again!). Thought the browned butter, honey, garlic and red pepper added up so well. Chopping aside this dish comes together fast.

Roasted the Brussels with EVOO, salt and pepper at 425 for 20 min. Removed from oven and topped with zested lemon. Browned the butter, then added some salt and the honey. Sauted my gnocchi with some EVOO for about 8-10 minutes, then tossed with all the components. Super delicious!!!! Will make again.

I have made several times with the following changes: roast the vegetables in the oven (my fav combo is Brussel sprouts and butternut squash), cut the butter to 3 or 4 Tbs, and add toasted walnuts.  I put most of the lemon zest in the oven with the Brussels and toss rest with the butter and gnocchi.

Admittedly, our sprouts were exceptionally large, but that's what came in the box (and the recipe didn't caution against large sprouts). Time to "unsave."

- **Comment Body:** I had one eyebrow raised the first time I made this and was floored by how well it worked. Adding prosciutto or diced Black Forest ham would probably layer another notch of flavor, but I haven’t tried it because this recipe is off the hook good as written. Be sure your sprouts are just barely tender before moving on to the gnocchi; don’t overcook them. If the sprouts are very large, quarter them or they’ll turn bitter. If you’re a wine person, Gruner Veltliner pairs nicely.

In response to my husband's dislike of the "hard" (overcooked?) gnocchi from the first time, I put them in simmering water for one minute before draining them well and panfrying them in butter. Perfect for us. Will serve adjusted recipe to guests.

- **Comment Body:** Oven roasted the Brussel sprouts in oil with lemon peels. Leftover Portobello mushrooms marinated in garlic and balsamic vinegar added another layer of umami and texture.  Used TJ's cauliflower gnocchi.  The key is to go straight from frozen to hot pan - it does take 15-20 minutes on fairly high heat in a large frying pan for gnocchi to get crispy.  But a very satisfying and quick meal!

But my husband has been advised by his doctor to avoid potatoes so I tried Trader Joes frozen Cauliflower Gnocchi which were recommended by a number of commenters.  What a disappointment.  Instead of crispy exteriors with pillowy interiors they were just mushy. They tasted good, but...yuck.  Does anyone have any hints for making them better?

Came together much faster to prep the gnocchi at the same time and the Brussel sprouts came out perfect. Searing and coating in brown butter might be our favorite way to cook gnocchi now - loved the crunchy outside and pillowy soft inside. Will try with other veggie combos.

Also I used chicken thighs as it was the only thing I had in the fridge. Frankly the outcome was a little gross, between the fattiness of the thighs and the creaminess of the sauce. I know, none of this is the fault of the recipe, but I guess my advice is don't use thighs and get a boyfriend who doesn't hover over you while you cook.

Added the tomato paste and after a few minutes deglazed with a splash of vodka. once that cooked off, I added the broth and followed the rest of recipe, adding the mushrooms along with the chicken in that step.

- **Comment Body:** Great recipe The principles used in this recipe can be applied to others. Pound chicken cutlet. Make sure meat is dry. Coat in flour and shake off excess. Sauté in olive oil. Add liquid and spices. Put on low to thicken. For chicken Marsala, add mushrooms and use Marsala wine instead of milk/chicken stock. For chicken piccata, add white wine and lemon juice. Throw in some capers.

- **Comment Body:** I also have been making this for decades - original, as I learned it, called for garlic, mustard and sour cream, trust me to die for - but the basic principle is that the meat is almost done as it is fried and that the sauce thickens from the flour used on golden-browning the meat. You could do this with different kinds and cuts of meat - cubed pork tenderloin, veal scallopini, boneless thighs, duck breast, etc. - and with different flavors and liquids - stock, heavy cream - for the sauce.

- **Comment Body:** A German pancake is a regular easy main for dinner for my spouse and me. My recipe has no sugar and two eggs; adding a third egg as in this recipe gives it more poof and a bit more custard. Mixing with a whisk is easier than using a blender that requires a scrape or two to incorporate all the flour. We find the pancake comes out of the pan more easily if it's rested for a couple of minutes after it comes out of the oven: it shrinks away from the pan and doesn't collapse.

Using bread or high gluten flour seems to give better results also. The last five minutes at 300 degrees seemed a waste of effort - my oven barely drops 10 degrees in 5 minutes. I cook 20 minutes at 425 degrees, shut off the oven and let it sit 5 minutes while I set the table. Perfect every time.

(Turned off oven when getting very brown on the top edge & didn't want it to burn.)Served with maple syrup & powdered sugar.Oven pancakes have such great flavor & texture bc of the high egg/low flour ratio.

A big family favorite -- one of sons would make  an entire one for himself on school holidays (at age 8 I would hear him in the kitchen).

I've tried asparagus and capers, mushrooms and Parmesan, lemon and sugar... nearly anything you can dream up can be added for a quick meal.

- **Comment Body:** Just finished eating this- best one I've made. I new Ms. Fabricant was a respected food writer so I trusted her recipe. Made it EXACTLY per the recipe and it was fabulous. The only change I made was that I only have a 9" cast iron skillet, not a 10", but it doesn't seem to have made much difference. I would recommend blending a full minute on low, scraping down, and blending 15 - 20 seconds on high before pouring into hot pan. Definitely goes in the "Winners" file.

What was different was that we started with a small, hot iron skillet and put that on a burner, adding butter, brown sugar, cinnamon and apple slices. We didn't go so far as to clarify the apples, and poured the batter in the pan and popped that into a 500º oven.  Enormously popular!

- **Comment Body:** This is the best version of this I've tried as a basic Dutch Baby recipe. I do add a few pinches of salt. It puffs up reliably every time. The classic topping is lemon and powdered sugar. Omit the nutmeg and add pepper, then cook in muffin tins and you have perfect Yorkshire Puddings--or at least ones like my ex Mother in law in Wiltshire use to make. I spent decades and several  oven fires trying to make those damn things and finally did it by adapting this recipe.

I'm very new to cooking and baking so I followed the instructions literally, which say to remove the pan "as soon as the butter has melted." The pan and butter were not nearly hot enough. It should say "once the butter is sizzling, but before it is browned." Other than that, it's an amazing, easy recipe.

Just pack the dry ingredients in a Ziploc bag; they'll almost surely have some butter and some milk on hand.  It's always a crap shoot with my friends if they have a decent cast iron skillet (my go-to for Dutch Baby) so I have been known to bring my own just in case.  And a jar of really good preserves.  But talk about appreciative hosts!

If you use 4 tablespoons, you’re Dutch Baby will be flat; It’s too heavy. Just use enough butter to coat the bottom of your 10” cast iron skillet (~1 tablespoon melted on the stovetop) and you will have a fluffy Dutch Baby.

The difference between this and Yorkshire is butter instead of beef fat, a little less milk and add a breakfast topping!  If you add sausage links to it, its called Toad in the hole in England.I think to keep it Breakfast related it should have some Apples or Pears baked into it.

I can still hear my grandmother (whose Yorkshires always puffed up higher than anyone else's) yelling as she opened the oven door: "Wahoo...it's another oven buster."   I think it was her cigarette ash that always fell into the batter as she whipped it by hand with a wooden spoon.

Use one of those cupcake baking trays, with a good tablespoon of your fat in each and place in the oven. Once the fat has melted and come up to temp. fill with the batter. It's gotta sizzle. Then pop back in the oven to cook. Serve with roast chicken or beef, all the standard Sunday roast veggies, and thick stock gravy. Perfect.

When you get up in the morning take the batter out of the refrigerator and let come to room temperature again. Beat the batter until light and foamy.  Then follow recipe. I do like my oven at 400 not 425.  Once I tried making the recipe in the morning and the results were dramatically less puffy.

I heated up the milk on the stove--very slightly.  I put the eggs in a bowl of just warm (not too warm) water.  This worked well.

- **Comment Body:** Yes, but you will have to play around with the temperatures (making them a little lower) and keep a very close eye on them in your first couple tries to get the timing down. However, as a long fan of Dutch pancakes, I have to warn you that you're cutting down on the fun. The crispy edges slowly turn into an almost pillow-like souffle that soaks up syrups and sauces like a dream. As a smaller pancake, it's going to be more consistent, like a Yorkshire pudding.

Sauteé a chopped apple in 2 tbsp butter, add a pinch of cinnamon, 2 tbsp of Amaretto, and 2 tbsp of real maple syrup, for a wonderful topping. Add sliced almonds if desired. Dust with snowy confectioner's sugar if kids are at the table.  This is a top 10 favorite recipe in my house. Everyone loves it!

Also much better to mix dry and wet ingredients separately like you do with any batter and combine together thoroughly by hand just prior to adding to the hot pan.

- **Comment Body:** I made this a few times and it always was good but there was something missing. Then I figured it out:  Heat the pan WITHOUT butter, while the oven is warming up to 425. Then, when you take it out you can throw the butter on and it’ll melt in seconds. This makes for a much more buttery, fluffy treat.   I also was generous with the nutmeg and powdered sugar—was delicious and didn’t need any other toppings.   Lastly, before turning the oven down to 300 I opened the oven to let out some hot air. Mm

The best way to avoid burning the butter in the pan (which is in the oven -- and which you forgot about, and which goes from not yet ready to ruined in about 2 seconds), is to melt the butter in that same pan ON THE STOVE! And then, pour the batter in, and put the whole thing in the PRE-HEATED oven. Done.

I also use a cast iron skillet and it seemed to also rise higher than my oven-rated nonstick Calphalon skillet.  Following this esay-peasy directions to the letter yields a beautiful, light tender pancake every time. One important caveat: DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN TO PEEK!

- **Comment Body:** Just made this and it was perfect!   Heated pan in oven and added butter to the hot pan before adding the batter.  Added some apple with cinnamon sugar on top after it came out of the oven.  So easy, so satisfying.  Really assisted in turning my mood around.

- **Comment Body:** To keep flour from getting stuck on the sides of the blender, I blend milk and eggs, then spoon half the flour, sugar and nutmeg (I weigh dry ingredients into a small bowl, 60g AP flour) in the center of the liquids, whizz it for a moment, and then add the other half, also into the center of the liquid.

I've adjusted the amounts as follows: 4 eggs 3/4 cup flour 3/4 cup milk 1 1/2 tbsp sugar ... and the rest I kept the same.  use BREAD flour.   also pre-heated skillet, tilt pan to coat pan with butter, then add batter all at once and return to oven. for 15 to 20 min, until puffed and golden brown.

Or if I happen upon a double yolked egg!  I top with turbinado suger after baking.  This photo, however, just not do the dish justice!!!   Much more beautiful....

- **Comment Body:** I fell in love with these in the 70s at The Original Pancake House in Eugene OR, while a student at UO. I've tried many recipes over the years & experimented with cooking in frying pans, cake pans, deep dish pie plates and paella pans. This version using my trusty cast iron skillet, nailed it. Since I used a 12" skillet, I increased the recipe to 5 eggs, 2/3 c. flour, 2/3 c. milk & added a pinch of salt with the nutmeg. Best recipe ever, especially with homemade lemon syrup.

- **Comment Body:** I love this recipe. Easy, foolproof, and best of all, delicious. From my experience with this recipe, the comment from Betsy Rich was spot on. The ingredients must be at room temperature to get the most dramatic rise. Also, like Helen commented, if you let it rest in the cast iron skillet a few minutes, it comes out with no problems. I lowered my oven temperature to 400 Fahrenheit and baked 18 minutes, then turn oven off and let it coast another 3 minutes. Turns out perfectly. Enjoy

- **Comment Body:** This is the first time I made this, so I have nothing to compare it to.  I forgot the milk until it was already in the oven. I watched it carefully, and initially cooked it for 10 min. before I turned the oven down.  It would probably be fluffier with the milk, but we enjoyed the pancake.  It had an egg flavor and puffed up beautifully.  The edges were a little crisp(in a good way).If I didn't know I had made a mistake,  I would still make it again in the same way. I will make it again correctly

- **Comment Body:** I make this all the time. It is perfection.   Don’t try to use less butter. The butter is what gives you the flaky goodness, it’s helping cook the batter on all sides. I’ve seen notable decreases in quality when omitting a tablespoon.    I don’t want my butter solids to burn, so instead of preheating WITH butter in skillet, heat your skillet in the oven first and only when oven is preheated to temp, take your pan out, add butter, which will melt within 30 seconds, add batter.

- **Comment Body:** I use either a glass pie pan or a ceramic pie plate that I preheat for about 5 minutes in the hot oven before adding butter to keep the pancake from sticking. Even in a gas-fuel oven, I get beautiful, symmetrical, poufed pancakes. We find that a good squeeze of lemon juice (or even bottled) with a dusting of powdered sugar is the best topping. You can increase the eggs, flour, and milk proportionately for a thick, custardy pancake, but I like them thinner, more like crepes with a three-egg mix.

- **Comment Body:** These are highly addictive. Be warned! I find having a properly 425F pre-heated cast iron skillet essential. It doesn’t matter then if your ingredients are room temp or taken from the fridge, the thermal inertia of the skillet will take care of making your Baby reach for the sky. We love the sweet version for breakfast in which I use just a bit of brown sugar, cardamom and a pinch of salt in the batter, then we overload the pancake with berries, sprinkle a little bit of maple syrup and mint.

The recipe is so fast that even if you mess up you can make a replacement very quickly. FYI, I warm the milk slightly in the microwave and it brings other ingredients to room temp.

I sauté a mix of veggies, whatever is handy, but our favorites are onions, broccoli, pepper and tomato. I dice a few slices of bacon and cook in the skillet. Remove the bacon bits, mixing them with the veg, leaving the fat to cook the pancake. I bake the pancake halfway, then add the veggies & bacon and lots of cheese (Swiss or Gouda are our favorites).

- **Comment Body:** I don’t use a blender. I use a whisk. My ingredients don’t have to be room temperature. I mix the wet ingredients first and I add the flour last a little at a time as I whisk. I usually add 1tsp of vanilla and 1tsp of lemon zest. You can add blueberries but drop them in the skillet last after you’ve poured the batter in. It then becomes a fruit toad-in-the-hole. I also serve it sautéed apples sometimes.   My recipe uses 3tbsp unsalted butter, and I bake at 400°F for 20 minutes.

- **Comment Body:** I have used lots of different dutch baby recipes over the years, but this one is the best I have found so far.  The trick I learned from this recipe that makes a big difference in the outcome is turning down the heat for the last part of the bake; this allows the inside of the dutch baby to cook and solidify without overcooking it or over-browning the outside. Also, the nutmeg is a nice addition!  My suggestions - Add some quality vanilla extract for some extra flavor, and always use good butter

Pancake won't puff as much but no one seems to care because it tastes so good.

- **Comment Body:** They are perfectly safe to eat. A little bit of science: only 1 in 20,000 eggs possibly carry salmonella; salmonella is destroyed at 160*F; cakes are set at 200-210*F; and the internal temp of the lava cake reaches that magic number of 160*F.  Also, if you are basing this concern on being told not to eat raw cookie dough because of eggs, the truth is people were getting sick from the flour in the cookie dough, not the eggs. So you can have your cake and eat it too!

My son was very particular which family and friends would have these for dessert only A Listers would get them.   Very easy to make and bake  I line the ramekin with buter and flour and find that they work best when quickly turned out after removing them from the oven.

- **Comment Body:** I made this last night and successfully converted it to be both gluten and dairy free. I was nervous but it came out perfectly! I subbed in coconut oil for butter and gluten free flour for the flour. Same quantities. I also used coconut sugar instead of regular sugar and subbed fiore de sicilia for vanilla.  Very forgiving recipe. Delicious, easy and impressive. I used small ovenproof bowls since I did not have actual ramekins. Served with a dollop of coconut yoghurt.

- **Comment Body:** Frankly I'm surprised at disappointed by the lack of fact checking by NYT. This cake not only tastes nothing like authentic lava (trust me I know, I've been to prime lava spots all over Europe), the recommended baking temperature is not even close to getting it as hot as lava.   Delicious for a chocolate cake though!

The 2nd time, I subbed 1/2 of the vanilla for pure almond extract, and I replaced the ramekin dusting of granulated sugar with cocoa powder.  Also - in case anyone without the fancy, traditional white ramekins happens to use pyrex/anchor glass food storage - the small 1 cup containers are oven-safe.  That's what I baked mine in!

Had ramekins as I fancied myself an accomplished dinner party host in the Before Times. Appreciated another reviewers tip that if you’re using 6oz ramekins it’s about 125g of batter per. That’s spot-on. Added a touch of cinnamon with the chocolate. Baked precisely 8 minutes per other’s comments. Perfection! Bonus - have the second ramekin for tomorrow night’s post-birthday cake.

So of course one of the first things I bought after college on my own at 22 was ramekins! I still have the Nigella Lawson Choco Hot Pots recipe saved, which is very similar to this one. But seriously, I use ramekins all. the. time. They are great sized prep bowls, for cracking eggs into, for small children. Creme brulee, lava cakes, and I've even used larger sized for individual shepherd's pie or potpie

- **Comment Body:** I refrigerated the batter in a mixing bowl for a few hours... then transferred to the 10 oz ramekin. I waited 30 minutes for it to get closer to room temp, and cooked it for 14 minutes.  I should have refrigerated it IN the ramekin. The batter developed a crust on top, and mixing it before transferring would have broken the fluffiness achieved from whisking it. Also, would have waited longer for it to come to room temp.  It was too runny, and didn't hold its shape when turned out.

I’ve over baked, under baked and a few times, gotten it just right. I’ve baked right away and I’ve made it ahead. With ice cream and whipped cream. Every time it’s delicious!

- **Comment Body:** I half the sugar and use any old oven safe bowl I have lying around. No ramekins. Hasn’t been an issue yet.  Last time I made this, I separated the batter in half since this recipe could really feed 3-4. Found my bf eating the refrigerated batter the next day. He thought I had made chocolate fudge. Honestly, it wasn’t bad.  My only issue with this recipe is that it’s so quick and easy to make, I find myself whipping it up late at night and then not sleeping after all that chocolate and sugar :’)

- **Comment Body:** Had an assortment of ramekins none of which matched from my late grandmother. Got rid of them all to cut down on clutter.  Bought new ramekins because you have to have them even if you have forgotten why.  Now I know why.   Had some release issues so I guess I will have to make them again!    These are very rich and we could only eat half a serving.  I think that means I need to buy some very small ramekins.  Oh grandma....

- **Comment Body:** This was a delicious and easy recipe!! I doubled the recipe and made 4 individual servings. The batter had been refrigerated for 2 hours so it took about 12 minutes to bake. If you make individual servings, I'd recommend taking each serving out of the oven as it's ready, so each serving has the perfect lava interior.

They came out well in muffin tins, anyway, baked for 7 minutes. Rave reviews.

I think I owned some many moves ago but I tend to swing wildly between minimalism and maximalism so there you go. I blatantly flouted the recipe notes and used chocolate chips instead of bar chocolate. Also, my husband was really mad at me for something not worth mentioning here so I really had to knock this out of the park. Well, I’m happy to report that he loves me again thanks to this cake. 10/10.

The longer they bake the more cake and less Lava will come out. It is a great dessert for a Valentines dinner for two.  Prepare the batter early, them pop them in the oven when you are ready to have dessert.

To see if they’re done, I tap the middle and if there’s a little bounce they’re likely ready. I only cook them 12-14 minutes as instructed.

They come in handy but not only the kitchen; for example, our cat has claimed one as her personal water bowl. Ramekins portion a menu option so it is less fussy to serve. Many a dessert or casserole can be made in them. A humble food is elevated to simple elegance just because it is served in a personal lovely ramekin!

- **Comment Body:** Just finished this with my husband.  Made it in 2 ramekins (which I have had since my late 20’s as I was a subscriber to Gourmet magazine - a moment of silence in remembrance-).  Followed the 400 degrees for 9 min recommendation from here but think it could have gone to 10.  Used the flour/oil baking Pam spray and they came out beautifully when inverted.    Thinking of using Grand Marnier instead of vanilla next time and serve with mandarin orange segments.

- **Comment Body:** SO good, and we had all the ingredients at hand. Except..no 10 oz ramekin. I'm 49, so you know how that is, ha. I baked it in a parchment lined mini springform pan (10 oz), worked fine. Our 1950s oven is always 475 degrees , but 14 minutes with door propped open with a heat diffuser worked. I think the key is to keep checking, since it goes from perfect to overbaked quickly. You can tell by pressing gently on the cake when the sides are firmer and just the center is a little liquid-y.

However, ramekins are great as stands for potted poinsettias that are too small to reach the tops of the Christmas motif planters. They're also great as stools for stacking things.

I use them for mise en place, serving sauces or garnishes and for plating. Very useful tools.   Found the baking time to not be long enough, as the first attempt was too wobbly and broke at the top despite getting too browned at the top. Needed 2-3 more minutes at a lower temperature.

I buttered and sugared three, thinking there would be too much batter for two, but the divided batter came to just the right spot on two of them, leaving me with an empty buttered and sugared ramekin. What to do?  I swiped my finger across the inside of the tasty sugared ceramic and licked it clean. Trust your ramekins.

Buy a dozen or more.  Eat several with a nice cafe.  Return to airport.  Enjoy the flight home. You will be home in under 24h with something truly wonderful.

I make a lot of breads and rolls, and I usually ignore the mixer instructions and just mix and knead by hand.  That's worked well in the past, but I'm concerned that the mixer might be important to this process.  Are there alternate instructions for hand mixing?  And yes, although perhaps not necessary, a video showing the rolling out and forming of the croissants would be delightful!

- **Comment Body:** The first day is very time intensive because of all the resting that needs to be done. I start around 9:30 and was done for the day around 3:30 to which you let it rest overnight. Day two all that needs to be done is cut/proof/bake. This all together takes 3-4 hours depending on how fast you can shape. So I would recommend starting before 1 on the first day and starting as early as you can on the second.

I noticed there is only 1 book fold and 1 letter fold.  That's only 2 turns.  There should be 3.  I don't 1 book fold and 1 letter fold will give you the same# of layers.

This allowed the butter to evenly disperse before adding the moisture and then was able to knead it into a smooth ball. Hope this helps!

- **Comment Body:** I'm also frustrated by NYT's frequent assumption that everyone has a stand mixer. Here, the key thing is that you need to develop strong, cohesive gluten without adding extra flour to achieve elasticity. You can do that with prolonged, vigorous hand-stirring (w/ a Danish dough whisk, if you have one), but probably best to avoid kneading & the temptation to add extra flour, unless you're comfortable handling slack doughs.

Put in fridge/freezer if dough gets warm, whether you’re finished the turn or not! 4. Proofing croissants may take FOUR TO SIX hours - wait for the puffy jiggle!

I usually make these in the fall or winter so the overnight temperatures mimic the refrigerator. Finally, I am 72 years old and don't have a scale and make do with measuring.

Everything that could go wrong went wrong--I let the butter get too cold, then too warm, had it come oozing out of the sides, etc. But Claire's recipe is forgiving. At the end of the day they still tasted AMAZING and I even got the super flaky crunch. Would not change anything, and they'll only get better with more practice!

Someone asked what to do with the little scraps, because, after taking all this trouble, it is a shame to waste any.    I rolled the scraps into a rectangle, sprinkled it with cinnamon sugar, rolled it up into a loose log.  Then, using dental floss, I cut one-inch thick tiny cinnamon rolls.  Baked at 375 F for twenty minutes, they were delightful with a schmear of cream cheese frosting.

If I try this again, I will need to chill the dough a lot more frequently.   For a beginner like me, this recipe along with the video was not that easy to follow, but not too complicated either. I don't like how the video doesn't give measurements making it a lot harder to use for reference.   I messed up a bit but they taste great. I'll try again in the winter!

I grated the cold butter into the dry ingredients before adding the water and milk and mixed by hand until the dough came together. Then I let it rest for 10 minutes before turning the dough onto the counter and kneading for 15 minutes. It’s fairly low hydration and not at all sticky, a dream to work with! Followed all other steps exactly.

My only complaint was that they were just too big. Even I, a croissant aficionado, couldn’t eat a whole one  at one sitting. So the second time I followed the recipe exactly until Step 16. Instead of rolling a 14x17 inch slab I rolled a 12x20 inch slab. The next day I  cut into 32 3x5” triangles. I baked 20 min turning 1/2 way. I had 32 delicious mini croissants!

I had minimal hope with how they'd turn out, mainly because a lot of things went wrong throughout the process. My butter leaked out the sides, the dough peeled at some parts during rolling, and some of them proofed awkwardly. However, they ended up tasting and looking amazing.

The dough is in the fridge, but doesn't seem to be rising the way it should.  I used  King Arthur bread flour and to get the first gathering, I had to add quite a bit more liquid. Added the butter, and it seemed smooth enough to let rise.  I'd rather throw this out (or bake it as something else) before I start to laminate.  I'm a seasoned cook.

### Recipe: Chocolate Chip Cookies

- **Comment ID:** 16530651
- **User Display Name:** William Wroblicka
- **Comment Body:** I think this recipe is unnecessarily fussy. The difference between the two kinds of flours is their protein content -- bread flour has 12.7% (per King Arthur Flour's website), cake flour has 9.4%, and all-purpose flour has 11.7%. The amounts of flour called for in the recipe are equal by weight, so the protein content of the combined bread and cake flours is 11.05%, which is practically the same as all-purpose flour. So I just used plain, old AP flour and the cookies turned out fine.

Place about 2/3 of butter in a skillet, melt and then lightly brown the butter. Pour browned butter over cold butter in mixing bowl and mix until cold butter is melted. Mix in sugars (1/2 Lt brown and 1/2 Dk brown), salt, eggs and vanilla. Mix thoroughly, then allow to sit for 3 minutes. Mix 30 seconds, then repeat twice. Then continue with recipe. Sugars develop beautifully!

I have adapted the recipe over the years, including pre-scooping the cookies onto a wax paper-lined cookie sheet and refrigerating them prior to baking.  I find it much easier to do it this way than trying to scoop cold dough.  I bake what I want and put the rest in a zip-lock bag to bake later.  These cookies are the best the day you bake them.

However, the longer the dough rested in the fridge the better it tasted. I baked it at 6 hours, 24 & 48 hours. Let me tell ya, it tasted the best after it has rested for 48.

All purpose flour is what I use for this recipe and it's perfect! However, tonight I used the cake and bread flour as the recipe suggested. What a mistake! The cookie was on the heavier side and it's more cakey. My kids wondered what happened and demanded the original cookie. Will definitely be sticking to all purpose flour from now on.

However these are big cookies and can hold a lot of fillings. I use 3 types of chocolate, white chocolate and walnuts, but I think  pecans would be better.Do not over bake, I found that on a good baking sheet with a good silicon sheet, that 14 to 15 min is perfect for a nice soft cookie.

I followed it with the exception of some recommendations from readers:  used a mixture of bittersweet, semisweet, and white chocolate; before chilling for 36 hours, I formed smaller than golfball-size balls and placed them in a large covered bowl (cannot imagine how hard it would be to work with the chilled, unformed dough); baked them on parchment lined baking sheets for 10 minutes before sprinkling a tiny pinch of flaked sea salt, then baked 5 minutes more.

- **Comment Body:** Make 50 gram cookies (just under 2 ounces; a bit smaller than a golf ball), cook for 15 minutes. Flat disks work better than chips; the chocolate melts into layers. Use 10 ounces bittersweet and 10 ounces semisweet chocolate disks for a more complex flavor. The cookies should be puffy and starting to brown when you take them out of the oven. Using parchment paper makes it easy to transfer cookies from baking sheet to rack to cool further; let them cool completely before removing from parchment.

The butter calms down after about a week's cure.-Hand rolling ping pong ball sized before chilling works best, throw them in a large muffin tin for more edge crumb and chewy goodness.

- **Comment Body:** Sure, it's a little more time consuming than other cookies, but if you want to make friends and be super popular, do it exactly as the recipe is written. However, I use Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate chips. They are disc shaped and they are not as sweet as other chips.  This is an amazing, perfect and special cookie and should not be altered.  Call me ridiculous,but I think of it as a work of art.  If you think it's too fussy and time consuming, just stick with Toll House.

- **Comment Body:** I went for "normal" size cookies, using a tablespoon size scoop (so old it is not numbered as they are now). The recipe made 7 dozen cookies. That would change the calculus considerably. Those are giant cookies! I used all-purpose Southern flour for the cake flour (White Lily).

- **Comment Body:** I've made these cookies many times, and I do not think I'll ever use another recipe for the go-to chocolate chip. Using both kinds of flours is a must. I have made the cookies multiple times with all-purpose flour and multiple times with the bread/cake flours. The AP flour cookies turn out fine, but never great; always have good flavor, but pretty hard. With the bread/cake flours they have perfect give in the middle and crunch around the edges; suddenly they go from fine to amazing.

- **Comment Body:** I thought these cookies were pretty good overall, however I had a slight problem with how much salt the recipe says to put in the dough. I put the 1.5 teaspoons of salt in the dough and found that the cookies when baked had a salty aftertaste. I recommend putting 1 teaspoon of salt in the dough for a less salty cookie. I don't know if other people like their cookies slightly salty, but I would just like to put this out there for people who are making this recipe for the first time.

This is my second kudo to the recipe so I won't do another, but I just also want to add, I've done them with bread/cake/all all purpose, dark brown, light brown, Costco vanilla, Trader Joe vanilla, and they have always always come out awesome.

- **Comment Body:** An awesome cookie with some tweaks. Following the advice of other bakers, use AP flour, reduce sugars by about 1/4 cup, use high quality butter - Kerigold or Kate's and DEFINITELY roll dough into golf ball sized balls BEFORE chilling. This makes about 4 dozen 2 1/2 inch cookies.   I think the recipe calls for way too much chocolate. A 12 ounce bag of 60% cacao chips or chunks is just the right amount for ample and well-distributed chips. I add 1 cup chopped pecans or walnuts.

- **Comment Body:** Having made these 3 times now does not make me an expert, but I'm getting better! I found if I use coarse salt, it will not sift through in the sifting process and is left behind in the sifter, so I use regular salt. I use a 10-oz bag of Ghirardelli 60% cacao chips and a 10-oz bag of Nestles triple chips (white, milk, and dark). Even my 95-year-old Dad, who has lost his appetite and much weight, can pack away 3 of these at a time and has gained nearly 4 pounds this last month! Thank you Jacques!

- **Comment Body:** Beating the butter and sugar for a good amount of time allows the sugar to disperse and dissolve evenly into the butter. It also puts air into it creating a fluffier texture. I always cream butter and sugar in recipes until the color completely changes and it becomes the texture of almost whipped cream.

- **Comment Body:** I've always loved the Toll House nestles. These are decidedly better, different. Portion shown gives a 5 - 6" cookie, so I half the amount. I love chop walnuts added for the slightly bitter counterpoint. Add the nuts just before baking and assemble @ room temp. the loosest possible pile of dough, chocolate, etc. w/ a bit of course salt on top- it all melts together. I've frozen them and bake a few at a time. Once baked they hold up for about 2 hours, next day not as good!  Large napkin indeed!

The combo of big chunks and tiny splinters of chocolate are amazing in this recipe. (Plus this chocolate is super affordable and delicious). Also - I’ve seen these tips mentioned in other reviews but worth seconding. Just use 17 oz all purpose flour, no need for 2 kinds of flour. Scoop the cookies before refrigerating.

- **Comment Body:** If I could add more stars to the rating, I would! I used 17 oz. of all-purpose flour. The cookies were shaped and refrigerated at least 36 hours before baking and at least 6 hours before being served. They were still a bit crunchy on the outside and chewy within - just the way I like a cookie to be.  Somewhere I read that gently compressing the cookies with a spatula the moment they are removed from the oven helps to retain the soft center. A brilliant trick which I will repeat again and again!

The difference between the two kinds of flours is their protein content -- bread flour has 12.7% (per King Arthur Flour's website), cake flour has 9.4%, and all-purpose flour has 11.7%. The amounts of flour called for in the recipe are equal by weight, so the protein content of the combined bread and cake flours is 11.05%, which is practically the same as all-purpose flour. So I just used plain, old AP flour and the cookies turned out fine."

- **Comment Body:** These are well worth the wait. The sea salt on top really brings out the flavor. I also portion out the dough and put it in the freezer after the original 36 hour refrigeration - they are great immediately, but better at 36 hours.  Hint, to make your own Cake Flour use 1 cup minus 1 tbsp AP flour plus 1 tbsp corn starch OR potato starch. Using the cake flour gives a more tender crumb. If you are watching our cholesterol, you can substitute 1/2 the butter with full fat greek yogurt using a scale.

- **Comment Body:** Hi Mariebl, if you brown the butter and let it re-solidify, you will have a puffier cookie due to their increase air you will be able to whip into the batter by using the creaming method. Using liquified butter directly after browning will result in a thinner, chewier cookie as it will partially melt some of the sugars, creating larger crystals and of course, not adding air through creaming.

I used only 15 ounces of chocolate chips and thought it was far too many, so I would suggest eye-balling that to your own preferences, as the dough was already quite rich. My fav cookie!

I worked at a bakery-cafe chain that uses the same temp for their cookies, and find that it helps develop a beautifully done crust and a soft bite in the middle. As a bonus, it allows for a decreased risk of accidental overbaking. For those who like cookies to be overbaked, ignore this note!

My notes: protein content of the 2 combined flours is similar to all-purp flour, so just use the AP. Also, the nearly two 12-oz bags of choc chips is too much IMHO. A single 12oz bag is perfect. Also, if you do the jumbo size cookies recommenced and freeze them, do disk-shape; in a giant ball, frozen, interior doesn’t bake thru. Finally, they are fine with just 2 hrs refrigeration time.

What was very helpful was forming the dough with my trusty Vollrath Size 40 scooper, THEN covering and putting in the fridge to firm up. That way, you can just pop them onto cookie sheets.

### Recipe: Chocolate Chip Cookies

- **User Display Name:** Best. Ever. Limit over-eating these by freezing dough
- **Comment Body:** Amazing recipe. I promote healthier eating for my job, but I absolutely love cookies! In this case, they are totally worth every bit of salt, sugar and fat... To prevent annihilating my body, I only bake half the recipe and freeze dough for future treats. I freeze them pre-salted and ready to bake. Freeze balls on a cookie sheet and, once frozen, keep in plastic zipper bag. I know that this is not revolutionary, but it bears repeating as a suggestion for tempering cookie monsters like me.

- **Comment Body:** I've been baking these 1-2 times a year ever since the recipe came out (2009?), and they are sensational. I just call them the "New York Times Cookies," and friends and family light up whenever I say I'm about to make a batch. At least 48 hours of chilling and 18 minutes seems to work best for the baking time. Longer than that and they get a bit too brittle. Pop one in the microwave for 5 seconds if any survive the first wave. It will become moist & tender again.

- **Comment Body:** I added 2 cups of chopped, toasted pecans to the batter. Then, instead of refrigerating the whole batch and trying to scoop cold dough, I laid a piece of plastic wrap out and placed about a quarter of the batch on it then formed a log and rolled it to about 1-1/4" thick x 15" long. I put these rolls in the refrigerator overnight then sliced pieces about 1" thick. I took a quarter cup of demerara sugar mixed with a quarter cup of coarse sea salt and pressed the dough in. Then bake

- **Comment Body:** Hi Mara,  Your issue isn't really related to your flour amounts (though it's always good to be as precise as possible when baking), it's with the butter. If you melted your butter in the microwave instead of creaming it with the sugar, you probably ended up with something more like a cookie batter than a dough. That explains why it isn't really scoopable. Creaming the butter allows you to add air to the mixture and mix the solids together without having the liquify the butter.

- **Comment Body:** The most compliments are always for three kinds of CC cookie: (1) this recipe (flatter, caramelized sugary-crisp crust with chewy interior); (2) the bakery-style chunk from Cooks' Illustrated's "The New Best Recipe" (fat, thick, doughier cookie); and (3) the toll-house recipe (standard).  I used AP flour, Ghiradelli 60% dark, and note that (1) it is difficult to cut through cold logs as your chocolate gets chunkier, and (2) a 45g/cookie is perfectly-sized.

Place about 2/3 of butter in a skillet, melt and then lightly brown the butter. Pour browned butter over cold butter in mixing bowl and mix until cold butter is melted. Mix in sugars (1/2 Lt brown and 1/2 Dk brown), salt, eggs and vanilla. Mix thoroughly, then allow to sit for 3 minutes. Mix 30 seconds, then repeat twice. Then continue with recipe. Sugars develop beautifully!

I’ve baked them immediately and at different hour increments and the flavors really start to emerge beautifully after 36 hours. I will also say that the cake and bread flour mixture produces better results than all purpose. The only thing I change is using slightly less chocolate and forming them into balls before refrigerating.

- **Comment Body:** Addendum:  These cookies are MUCH better Day #1: delicate crispness of exterior is lost when stored--even just 24 hrs. in vacuum-sealed container. Since contrast between crisp exterior/chewy interior = unique selling proposition, I recommend baking only what you can eat Day #1 & refrigerating/freezing remaining dough for future use. I baked some chilled 24 hrs. & some chilled 48 hrs. w/o clear difference in texture/flavor. Saltiness fine w/ Diamond Crystal kosher & Maldon.

- **Comment Body:** Love these cookies but had difficulty with scooping the dough after the 24 hour refrigeration. I came up with another method that doesn't change the results but is so much easier. After mixing ingredients scoop the cookies immediately onto parchment covered cookie sheets, pressing into round discs - refrigerate for 3-24 hours before baking. There is no change in flavor or texture and the cookies have a much better shape. I also see no difference if refrigerated 3 or 24 hours.

- **Comment Body:** These are the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever made - ever. I do one additional step to help the center of the cookie get and stay chewy.  When I remove the cookies from the oven I give the cookie sheet a rap on the counter to help deflate any ‘rise’ from baking. Then let the cookies cool on the sheets until set. I use that same technique on my oatmeal cookies, or any other cookie that I want to be chewy. It’s quick and effective.

(I will try another batch with cake flour, just to see the difference.) I baked after 36 hours — again, delicious. Listen to the wise people here who pre-rolled or pre-portioned the dough! It was a feat of strength to work the cold dough out of the bowl.

I have made one change:   The cookies are too large for my family.  I divide the dough before I chill it into balls weighing 7/8 ounces.  This results in 4 times as many cookies.  This is the perfect size for me and my family.  I then freeze the balls and bake them as I need them.  No need to defrost before baking.

Warning though- these are cookies for true chocolate lovers, as they are really like puddles of chocolate held together by dough. 100% delicious, but if you're not a fan of rich chocolate and would prefer more dough and less of an overload, it's probably not the recipe for you. For chocaholics, though, it's perfection.

(although they also make beautiful discs.) for me the chips offer a more contained chocolate experience where the discs offer a more equal distribution of chocolate:dough.

As I could not find chocolate disks or Valrhona feves, I mixed half chocolate chips and half chopped-up chocolate bar, and that was fine. Additionally, subbing flax eggs and vegan butter ended up being very good -- the flax taste is imperceptible in the recipe. (Omnivores ate all my cookies.) Just be careful when whipping vegan butter if you haven't before -- it separates more quickly than dairy butter.

Cake flour is unnecessary; I got similar results with just 3 1/3 cups of all purpose flour, instead of the 2 types.  2. Any salt is fine, eg table salt.   3. Chocolate chips work like a charm. I also round down to ~1lb, depending on how much I have on hand.   4. Freezes well in golf ball sized portions, for <3 or 4 months. No need to thaw.

- **Comment Body:** I sincerely disagree about the two flours. Did an experiment where I made two batches. One all AP, one with both. Cured for 36 hours, baked, and tested. All who tasted chose both flours as their favorite. I keep cake flour on hand at all time just for this recipe which I make at least three times a month.

My mother was an excellent cook who would try anything, but she was not a baker, so that is something I have had to learn by experience. Love the good tips.  Does the white dot or the red dot make a note private?

(Creaming butter with a mixer, measuring flour correctly, etc.)This recipie has almost a caramel flavor and texture that developed from the refrigeration. I notice a significant difference compared to typical chocolate chip cookie recipes. (Ex: tolhouse.)

- **Comment Body:** Oh and another note: definitely let these cookies cool maybe 30 mins after sliding them out of the oven. Eaten fresh off the oven, their edges will be much too crisp, the centers too moist. When cooled, the crisp along the edges will have mellowed to a delightful firmness, and the centers become satisfyingly chewy. So good.

After resting the dough I bring it to room temp and scoop out dough balls with an ice cream scoop. I bake some and then freeze the rest of the scooped cookie dough so I can take it out a few pieces at a time and bake it off when I have cookie craving.

- **Comment Body:** I have made it three times and love it. Yesterday’s batch was the best. I made a half recipe and used 6 ounces of bittersweet chocolate and 4 ounces of Valrhona Dulcey Feves, which have a butterscotch flavor. I put the whole batch in a 9”x9” pan, chilled them for one hour and baked for 30 minutes. The result is divine. Also I used AP flour in place of the bread flour (but still used cake flour). This made the cookies very light. I did not salt the top as it seemed salty enough. Really good!

Only issue is the capacity of my 5 qt stand mixer bowl could not handle the addition of the choc chips, ended up mixing the final 15 ounces or so by hand - not fun. So next time, I plan on using 2 bowls and making 2 batches simultaneously instead of straight doubling the recipe.

- **Comment Body:** Classic cookies w/ crisp exterior & chewy interior.  Re timing w/ (weighed) 3.5-ounce mounds: 18 min. was perfect after 24 hrs. in fridge.  Re salt: Setting indiv. palates aside, brands of coarse salt (including kosher salt) differ in Na+ content, which may account for differences in saltiness. 1/4 tsp. Diamond Crystal = 280 mg. Na+ vs. Morton 480 mg. Re quantity of chocolate: choc : cookie ratio is high (1 lb. might be more balanced) but I'm not complaining. Used El Rey Gran Saman 70% discs.

I used AP and regular chocolate chips and they turned out great (though I don't doubt that chocolate disks work well--just more expensive). I rolled the dough out to about 1 inch thickness before chilling and then broke off pieces--worked well if you are okay with a varied aesthetic.

I followed recepies instructions except for the sea salt only used on part of the batches.  I made dough and chilled over night.  Large metal spoon is a must to break lose dough from bowl. I let the dough set room temp about hour then began rolling. I also rolled smaller balls, ping pong size.  Set them on baking sheets about 4 dozen cookies and baked 14 minutes.  Yum. Keeper.

The 3.5 oz cookies were gigantic, so I also tried making a half-size version. The 1.8 oz size was still a generously-sized cookie, but not so overwhelming. This size cooked in ~13 minutes in my oven. These will definitely be my go-to cookies from here on out! Thank you!

Delicately crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle, even five days after baking. Don't be daunted by the two kinds of flour (and don't substitute them), mix that butter and sugar until fluffy and observe the 24-36-hour chill time (don't cut corners). I let mine sit at room temp for two hours so I could scoop. Still good.

I made it with all-purpose flour (measured by weight), normal semisweet chocolate chips, and no salt on top, and they were still super delicious with a great texture.  Also, instead of refrigerating the dough and scooping it cold, roll it out into balls while it’s warm, stick them in the freezer for however long you want, and have cookies whenever—not just 1-3 days after making the dough.

- **Comment Body:** Also a tip on the chocolate disks - I used Ghiradelli's Grand Chocolate Chips (60% Cocoa of course) from a basic grocery store and they are the perfect sized chocolate disks. And the disk shape does make all the difference. It creates these thin layers of chocolate that spread throughout the cookie and almost make a swirl. The chocolate disk makes the cookie.

After reading through much of the comment section, I decided to give it a go and make them exactly as directed. These cookies are truly the gold standard. Perfectly golden, crisp edges and delightfully soft, gooey interior. I measured ingredients by weight rather than volume, and weighed each one to exactly 3.5 oz, baked for the full 20 minutes. Tastes like a hug.

This is the batch that disappointed:" too greasy, too thin." The remainder I baked after 36 hours. Some kind of magic happened with the longer rest. These were far better. Great recipe if you are patient and willing to wait the full 36 hours.

Place about 2/3 of butter in a skillet, melt and then lightly brown the butter. Pour browned butter over cold butter in mixing bowl and mix until cold butter is melted. Mix in sugars (1/2 Lt brown and 1/2 Dk brown), salt, eggs and vanilla. Mix thoroughly, then allow to sit for 3 minutes. Mix 30 seconds, then repeat twice. Then continue with recipe. Sugars develop beautifully! 597

I used a mixture of Trader Joe's semisweet chocolate chunks + Guittard's 63% dark chocolate chips with sea salt sprinkled on top. I baked for ~18-19 min and the result is beautiful, crisp cookies on the outside and soft on the inside. I recommend for novice bakers!

She didn't seem to mind! I bought a new scale for the occasion.  It gave me confidence, especially around the flours. 8.5 oz of cake flour is indeed more in volume than the same weight of bread flour. Similarly, it was great to weigh the 10oz. brown sugar rather than the old "well packed cup, etc".

- **Comment Body:** It’s a little more complicated, and you’ll have to plan ahead: after assembling the dough, you must chill it for at least 24 hours before baking it, and preferably up to 36. This allows the dry ingredients time to soak up the wet ones, which results in a firmer dough. a marvelously chewy, chocolate-rich cookie. good chocolate and sea salt is not an option. a stand mixer makes it easy work.

- **Comment Body:** For whatever this is worth…I generally make this recipe (which yields about 16 or so equal in weight, balls of cookie dough) and bake only six cookies. The remaining go in the freezer. The last batch of dough was made in May. I thawed and baked as needed during the Summer. Today, October 11th, almost 5 months later, I baked the last two and they tasted as good as the initial six.   While the recipe says dough can be refrigerated for up to 72 hours, long term freezing has no impact on the result.

- **Comment Body:** You can sub cake flour by adding cornstarch (if that's accessible) to regular all purpose flour (I think bleached would be closer - cake flour is usually bleached). Google for exact measurements.  Not sure about a bread flour sub though - if you know of a flour that is higher in protein, that would be the one to use.  However, many people in these reviews have said they only used all all purpose and the cookies came out fine (I've always followed the recipe, but I'm nerdy that way).

- **Comment Body:** Unbelievable cookie. Just so so good. Used all purpose flour as well, did a mix of bittersweet chunks and chocolate chips and the result was awesome. Little less than 20oz, probably more like 15oz. Also didn’t use a sifter to mix dry ingredients, just a fork. Definite tip to roll into balls (careful not to make them too big) and store in bowls wrapped in Saran rap in your fridge. I did just 2 without chilling them and they were great. Excited to see how they are after 24 and 48 hours.

- **Comment Body:** Instead of making the big cookies, I scooped the dough with a 1½" scoop, which baked to 2½".  I scooped out 5 doz onto ½sheet, covered & chilled. Since they're smaller, reduce time to 12 minutes.  I baked 1 doz the first day, per recipe baked 18 mins in my Breville convection oven, hard as concrete. After dough in fridge 48 hrs, baked 2 doz 12 min, really nice! Will bake last 2doz tomorrow. Used White Lily self-rising flour (accidental purchase), omitted baking soda, powder, salt. Worked great!

On the very off-chance that anyone else is trying to make them in Germany, where all the flour types are different, I used half 405 flour and for the other half, a 50/50 mix of 550 and 1050 flour. I brought them to a party and someone described them as the "platonic ideal of a chocolate chip cookie.“

- **User Display Name:** Ocotillo
- **Comment Body:** For what it’s worth, cake flour is “a soft, low-protein flour that is very finely milled and strongly bleached with chlorine dioxide or chlorine gas. The chlorine treatment turns out to cause the starch granules to absorb water and swell more readily in high-sugar batters and produce a stronger starch gel. It also causes fats to bind more readily to the starch granule surface, which many help disperse the fat phase more evenly.” On Food and Cooking, by Harold McGee, 2004 revised edition

In that case it would be about 3 2/3 cups...

The first time I baked these, I checked them at 15 minutes ( still longer than the avg. of 12 most cookies bake at)and they were a smoldering, inedible mess. Next time, I cut down to 12 minutes and they were still a bit overdone. Finally arrived at a perfect time of 10 minutes. I know ovens and tastes vary, but I'm pretty sure that in more than 50 years of baking I've not seen a cookie recipe that calls for 18-20 minutes!

Resting the dough is ESSENTIAL, though.     The only true mods I have made: sometimes I like to add a little lemon extract when I use dark chocolate to bring out some other flavors in the chocolate. I've also reduced the amount of white sugar and used chocolate chips (they were still fantastic). The heart and soul of this recipe is the flours.

- **Comment Body:** I think this recipe is unnecessarily fussy. The difference between the two kinds of flours is their protein content -- bread flour has 12.7% (per King Arthur Flour's website), cake flour has 9.4%, and all-purpose flour has 11.7%. The amounts of flour called for in the recipe are equal by weight, so the protein content of the combined bread and cake flours is 11.05%, which is practically the same as all-purpose flour. So I just used plain, old AP flour and the cookies turned out fine.

I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and a Theo 82% chocolate bar. I made 6 and froze the rest of the dough in the 3.5 oz balls for later use.

I got into the habit of adding an extra egg yolk every time I made them (a tip from CI). I form the dough into a thick log before refrigerating, then use a bench scraper to cut the log into slices that I weigh, then shape into balls.  I sprinkle the surface with Maldon salt flakes.  Chewy, substantial, sophisticated, delicious!

I’ve made this recipe for years, adhering to it faithfully, but I have noticed that while the cookies bake up chewy, they stale and turn hard and crumbly much quicker than others, often within 24 hours. Now if you have hungry guests that polish them off quickly, but they don’t do well for, say, Christmas cookie platters.

I roll mine into a log and leave it in the fridge, slicing 1/2" and baking right away after a sprinkle of maldon salt (don't skip this step).  The results are uniform and thick, chewy chocolate chip cookies.

In blind tastings with my family, no one could tell the difference or AP was preferred slightly. * Brown the butter for a nice nuttiness.  Increase butter to 3 sticks and use 3 eggs instead of 2. Cook the butter over medium heat until it stops hissing, then set aside and let it cool for ten minutes before adding.

- **Comment Body:** I’ve been in search of the perfect Chocolate chip cookie and this may be it! Great crisp edge texture and perfect flavor. I refrigerated the dough around 45 hours- great! I varied the recipe two ways following suggestions : First, I rolled the dough into 4 parts before refrigerating- they were about 2” in diameter. They were easy to cut and bake. Second, I did not want 18x 5” cookies! I like a 3” cookie size. So I sliced my dough about 2/3” thick before baking and baked them 15 minutes. Perfect!

- **Comment Body:** Unfortunately the most helpful comment on this thread by William is not true. Using different types of flours makes a big difference because they're made from different types of wheat. That's how the protein ratios differ. You can get by with AP flour, but there is a clear distinction in the taste. I sometime mix all three flours while trying to keep the protein ratio around 9% or AP flour levels. The world is your oyster!

Trust me, it's not too many chocolate chips. And don't skimp on quality of chips. The Ghirardelli 60% cacao discs put these cookies far above all other chocolate chip cookies!

- **Comment Body:** The coarse salt is mandatory! It just balances out the sweet in the cookie in the most perfect way. But make sure to use unsalted butter otherwise you will find it way too salty.    I was making these with my niece and nephew.  No way they were going to wait 24 hours to bake them.  We did 10 minutes freezer and 20 minutes refrigerator.  They came out delicious.

- **Comment Body:** The thing that makes the most difference is the aging the of dough in the refrigerator. Do not skip this step. I have used All Purpose flour (always King Arthur) or the recommended combo of cake and bread flour, both work well, but you don't get the chew or the caramel tones/richness unless you wait at least a couple of days before cooking. After aging, the dough freezes well and I recommend making into balls that can be cooked into a batch of fresh cookies whenever needed, without the wait.

- **Comment Body:** Hands down, my favorite recipe here. I use AP and cake flour in mine. I also add half dark and half semi sweet chocolate. I roll my batter in logs about an inch and a half to two inches thick. Wrap in saran wrap and store in fridge. When time to cook, simply cut logs into one inch disks and cook. So easy. I have found that I like the batter better after at least a week in fridge. I have gone up to a month and all points in between. I feel it allows for a creamier cookie.

Use the tall green shoots from the garlic instead of scallions to add flavor and greenery to any number of dishes. The roots that grow swirl in a lovely pattern in the bottom of the vase, and the bulb will continue to produce shoots for weeks.

- **Comment Body:** YiaYia, a mortar and pestle crushes the garlic, releasing its flavors and oils, but a food processor just cuts it up finely, and the hard sides of the garlic are still intact, albeit smaller.  But, little of the garlic’s flavor is released when it is simply cut into small pieces, so if you don’t have a mortar and pestle, it’s better to crush the garlic with the flat side of a heavy knife, and then mince it.

Cook approximately 10 minutes, stirring frequently, adding more water towards end if needed as noodles absorb the water and soften. Add favorite sauce - or transfer as recommended in this recipe and toss till you are happy with the finish.

On a well supported cutting board, smash garlic cloves with the flat side of a chef's knife - making sure to: hold the handle of the knife over the edge of the board; center the blade over the garlic (lest you send the clove flying across the kitchen); and give the side of the blade a nice hard whack. 2.  Gather smashed cloves into what will look almost like a pile of pulp, and mince away.  Easy; fast; efficient - and a great way to channel aggression.

- **Comment Body:** I found a garlic "rocker" on Amazon while browsing kitchen utensils. I's a bent bar shape with small holes in the center. You press down and rock back and forth on a garlic clove and it pushes the garlic through the holes, releasing the most intense garlic flavor. It's much like a press, but without the messy clean up and frustration of getting all the garlic out of the press. It cleans up in about 15 seconds. I'll never mince garlic again!

I told my Roman-born husband it was like Vietnamese carbonara. We added lots of black pepper (like the crab dish has). Anyone tried it w/ bottarga instead of cheese?

A recipe calling for 20 cloves should really have some notes about adjusting based on what garlic you're using. Notes here talk about too much garlic flavour, or not enough. 20 cloves of one garlic or another will make a huge difference

Using a mortar and pestle is an absolute must, the garlic becomes creamier and less harsh, making for a much more cohesive sauce. This recipe is in my opinion wonderful with the smashed garlic but underwhelming with knife-minced garlic.

- **Comment Body:** Delightful. Told my kids it was Vietnamese garlic and oil. No cheese for me but the kids went for it. Would like a bit of heat next time add a teaspoon of chili flake or a fresh chili. Definitely a keeper.

- **Comment Body:** 20 cloves of garlic? For that many, recipe writers need to get with the fact that people with access to a farmer's market or home garden are using hard-neck garlic a lot these days. The cloves of a hard-neck can be four times larger than the soft-neck garlic which is sold in grocery stores. When using one or two cloves, it's easy to estimate an adjustment, but with 20, a person could go very wrong! Instead of 20 cloves, how about an approximate weight?

- **Comment Body:** I was going to say this too! Why would anyone not use a microplane?Though twenty is a lot for that method, it's a true. A great trick for getting garlic smell off fingers is to rub them on anything made of stainless steel under running water. I use the metal handle of my microplane--magic!

- **Comment Body:** I used the trusty food processor to mince the garlic in about 6 seconds. Believe me, the power of the garlic was not diminished because it wasn’t crushed. I find it sautés better cubed than crushed - far less browning and burned bits and it doesn’t clump. Just my option but if you don’t feel like mincing 20 cloves don’t feel that your final product will suffer for it.

- **User Display Name:** Carla
- **Comment Body:** The author of this article suggests adding raw shell-on shrimp at the beginning of the cooking process. WHY shell-on? I find nothing quite as annoying as having to plunge my hands into a beautifully cooked dish to remove shrimp shells. It destroys the dish, my hands, and any pleasure that might come from eating the shrimp. Food preparation should result in something that can be eaten and enjoyed with a modicum of fuss. Shell-on shrimp mixed with noodles, garlic, butter and cheese is not that.

- **Comment Body:** Made this last night  - was a hit!  I used two tweaks I discovered on YouTube for this dish: 1. Bucatini noodles are thicker and have a great chewy mouth feel 2.  Added a ladle-full of pasta water to the minced garlic in the wok to parboil it a bit, and boiled it away.  Then added the butter, and finally the sauces.  This tamps down the garlic bite  - I love garlic, but too much garlic doesn't love me

- **Comment Body:** Honestly I don't get all the garlic talk. Either you like it or you don't. Either you have a preferred way of preparing it or not. If garlic isn't your thing, maybe not make this recipe. Just saying. I am always recalculating recipes to serve two, so I used ten cloves of garlic. Perfect for our taste. We visited Thanh Long in SF for the roast crab. Now I'm sorry I didn't pay more attention to the noodles! This recipe is a winner!

- **Comment Body:** I cooked it with a few adjustments and would change somethings if I make it again. I smashed the garlic then minced it. Got great garlic flavor. I added about 1 tbs of minced, fresh ginger. I added 1 tsp brown sugar and 2 tsp sambal too. It tasted like it was missing something so I added a few splashes of mirin at the end. I will add double the sauce ingredients (except garlic/ginger) next time and make less pasta as the overwhelming flavor was garlic. It was imbalanced— it was begging for acid.

Next time I make it (probably tonight) I'll drain the pasta with a pitcher under the sieve to catch the pasta water. The pasta goes all straight into the sauce, and the pasta water is easily poured into the pan as needed.

Just perfect.  I have followed the career of Lopez-Alt for some time, and he is amazing.  Whatever he says, I'll make!!

Next time I may add pasta water to sauce before adding cooked pasta. Give it more liquid to emulsify the cheese.  Tomorrow I'm going to sauté mushrooms, add some jamon and jazz this dish up.  Add cracked pepper too.

- **Comment Body:** Amazing! If you don’t like this, you didn’t go it right.  Made single serving by dividing by 4. I will stress you need to undercook your pasta. My cheese clumped but I turned the heat up and added more and more pasta water and stirred until it turned into the gorgeously creamy sauce in the picture.   had no oyster sauce so I doubled the soy and fish sauce. I am amazed that, even with 5 cloves garlic in 1 portion, the garlic flavor was subtle. Creamy smooth and umami.

I have even used Banza for an easy complete meal. Made as written, tastes like the best "pasta roni" ever. With simple adjustments to the recipe you can change the flavor profile to fit any meal. Like sesame oil and extra fish sauce for a more asian feel or extra cheese and roasted garlic for a more italian feel. The possibilities are endless! A Must try!

I just got through eating a bowl and I loved every bite but it's too much garlic. I am all garlic now, my whole body is garlic and my mind and emotions and soul.

It needed a little more salt and a little heat so we added a pinch of red pepper. I made a super simple stirfry of shrimp and broccoli with garlic and soy sauce (blanched broccoli for 1 min first) and mixed it in when the noodles were done. Will definitely repeat with fresh garlic.

- **Comment Body:** Yum!!!! Much tastier than the ingredient list would seem.  I cut the recipe in half, but next time I think I'll keep the full amount of the sauce and just cut the pasta amount in half.  I did the smash-then-mince thing with the garlic, because I don't own a mortar & pestle, and it worked perfectly well.  Additional ideas for toppings/mix-ins next time:  mixed seafood (Trader Joe's sells this frozen, ready to cook), shelled edamame, cut up broccoli, halved grape tomatoes, or sliced bok choy.

- **Comment Body:** Now that I'm older and the arthritis in my hands is an issue I've needed to make adjustments.  Garlic and ginger that comes in a tube is easy to use and adds a nice flavor.  It may not be the same as smashing, dicing or grating fresh bulbs or roots but better than nothing.

Am I the only one who was expecting more of an umami bomb? I just got garlic. I didn’t really taste anything else. I followed the recipe as written and…I’m totally bummed.

Kikkoman Soy Sauce instead of oyster sauce  Worcestershire Sauce instead of Light Soy Sauce  Coriander instead of spring onions for freshness Felt it needed:  - a bit of lemon juice (very little),  - crushed dry chilli for heat,  - fresh black pepper, - extra cheese. Would be interesting to try with the smallest bit of numbing oil.

I feel like maybe it’s because of the amount of pasta- 1lb seems like it may have been too much for the amount of sauce. Not sure I’ll ever make again, but if I do, I’m going to cut the amount of spaghetti in half.

I have cooked the noodles according to the recipe and while it works it makes a mess.  So now I just boil them in a deep pot as I normally would and after I drain them I drop them back in the deep pot and add the garlic sauce.  I reserve some of the water just in case.  Much easier and less messy and comes out exactly the same!

Enter Dorot frozen garlic cubes, found at Trader Joe’s. Not as good as fresh garlic, but much much better than the jars of chopped garlic. You can keep it in the freezer for those moments when you realize you’ve run out of fresh garlic and the pot is already on the stove.

If the fish is a fresh catch, or whole, you can simply use this coconut/turmeric mixture to marinate or brush on fish for grilling. Less sauce but flavor will be absorbed. Serve golden grilled fish with spicy sea food dipping sauce made of fresh chilly/garlic/lime juice/sugar/a little fish sauce, and you'll be in heaven.

- **Comment Body:** WOW!!! I have made several of the NYT'S fish preparations, and I have to say, this one is AMAZING! I used halibut, and let the cherry tomatoes get a head start with 10-12 mins in the oven before adding the fish. I did not cut them in half, and there wasn't any splatter. I also did not broil at the end, as my Le Crueset and casserole pans say not to broil or use high heat above 450. I don't like to use a sheet pan for things with sauce as it spreads, and  hard to get all the luscious sauce after.

Marinated the chicken for 4 hours with half the sauce and reserved the other half to spoon on later. Good times with pearl couscous and steamed broccoli!

### Recipe: Coconut Fish and Tomato Bake

- **Comment ID:** 127469977
- **User Display Name:** Liesel
- **Comment Body:** No splatter tip!   1- Choose grape tomatoes and you can bake them whole. These tomatoes have a lower water content and meatier flesh, compared to cherry tomatoes. They get a lengthwise no-mess split. Cherry tomatoes pop and splatter due to the higher water content, thinner walls, and shape.   2- Cooking in a baking dish raises the sauce level around the tomato, which also helps.   I made the dish with salmon and Juliet grape roma tomatoes from my garden. I served it over jasmine rice.

Then baked for 15 mins. I didn’t have cilantro so I used Thai Basil that I am growing in my garden. I served it with coconut brown rice. I used the remaining coconut milk for the rice.

- **Comment Body:** I had fun with this. Used Pacific cod, not mentioned as an alternative but terrific, and added crimini mushrooms. They soaked up the sauce wonderfully.  The next day, having finished the fish but not the veg and sauce, I took several leftover anchovies out of the fridge, mashed them, added them to the veggies and heated it all up. Wonderful! This suggests that fish sauce might be a good addition to the dish as well, if you are using a whitefish. Not sure salmon would work with that variant.

- **Comment Body:** So good and easy. Based on others' comments, I just put the sauce in a Pyrex baking dish, added the fish and tomatoes, and baked it all together (I don't bother with the final broil). I make the full amount of sauce but less fish, and its nice to have the sauce for rice. After making this a couple times I stopped marinating in advance and there's no difference. (I've read that marinating does very little). I think this would work great with tofu instead of fish. Aleppo pepper is great in this.

Then I pack a glass pyrex dish with fresh spinach and drop the tomatoes on top. The fish (grouper) with sauce gets added on top of that and 20 minutes in the oven at 425 (no broiler) presents a perfectly cooked dish. I serve it with fresh sourdough baguette.

- **User Display Name:** Bob Rosen
- **Comment Body:** I'm surprised at the medium-high heat recommended for caramelizing the shallots. In my experience, shallots are much more sensitive to cooking temperature than onions — and are prone to burn if cooked too quickly. I'd suggest turning the heat down just as soon as the shallots have begun to sizzle a bit — otherwise they'll be burned well before they've fully caramelized.

I’d try with a smaller amount Of anchovies — even just 1 or 2 — and work your way up. Cooked like this they somehow both disappear into subtlety while exploding with savoriness. I used to think I hated anchovies, but I don’t anymore thanks to Alison.

- **Comment Body:** Anchovies are a concentrated umami source. The closest substitute is fish sauce, as Andrew points out: see Harold McGee's "On Food and Cooking". The Romans' fish sauce was called Garum: after it went out of fashion, anchovies replaced it - both are fermented fish products.  If you're vegan, use fermented soybean paste or miso, which are more intense than soy sauce. (Olives and capers are nice, but lack umami, which is due to savory amino acids, primarily glutamate, from a protein source.)

The flavors were extraordinary, quite unlike any pasta dish that I have ever had.  I love anchovies, but in this dish I could not taste them at all.  But they do add a certain umami that adds to the depth of flavor of the sauce.  I’ll definitely be making this again!

### Recipe: Caramelized Shallot Pasta

- **User Display Name:** Bobbie R.
- **Comment Body:** As an inexperienced cook/foodie who’s never had an anchovy, I thought that this pasta dish was a little bit strange, but solidly good. I went back for a second helping, as did my boyfriend who remarked that it reminded him of Chinese food (huh?). But just now for a light lunch I decided to have some toast with the leftover shallot jam and a fried egg on top, and oh my GOD. It was so delicious!! This leftover paste is going to change my life. Probably a permanent staple in my fridge now.

- **Comment Body:** Great recipe. Some suggested edits:  - As others said, cook shallots on low otherwise they will burn before getting a deep rich caramelization - I felt it needed something acidic to brighten up the dish.  Adding some capers with the brine to the shallots right before adding the pasta did the trick

- **Comment Body:** This was just awful.  For so many reasons.  The shallots disappeared in the thick sauce.  The quantity of anchovies was proportionally too great (and I love anchovies).  The red pepper flakes did not add enough heat.  The oil from the anchovies made the whole thing too oily.  The tomato paste - even after cooking - still tasted like tomato paste.  People must not know what a good pasta sauce is if they think this is one of the best of the year.  Blech.

- **Comment Body:** If you really can't bring yourself to use anchovies (or don't have any in the pantry), olives in some form are the obvious choice.  But how about some good balsamic vinegar?  (It goes well with all both shallots and tomato.)  Or to go with a completely different (but still complementary) flavor profile, mushrooms?  Tempeh?  A little bit of sopressata cut in tiny cubes?  A big handful of basil?  Sage?  Think about different ways to complement and work off the shallots.

- **Comment Body:** meh. this was fine, but I found the taste of the shallots to be overwhelmed by the tomato paste, and the anchovies were very subtle. If I make this again, I'd use 50% more shallots. I do like that it uses a whole can of tomato paste - and it keeps very well in the fridge and freezer and is a versatile thing to add to other foods where you might be adding tomato paste. but probably would not go through the effort to make a slightly dressed up tomato paste during non pandemic lockdown times.

My only suggestion is to turn one the heat a bit when caramelizing shallots so that they don’t burn. I’m an advanced cook so was able to correct this pretty early on. I also would suggest adding a bit of pasta water to half the sauce to help it spread better. I found it a bit dry to spread on the pasta.

Was still very tasty but a little less fishy. 2) I toasted some homemade breadcrumbs and added to the garlic clove and parsley at end. This gave a nice texture to the dish that it initially lacked. I also added a bit of Locatelli Romano at the table. Took a great recipe to my husband's new favorite.

The mix also needs more cooking time than two minutes after adding the tomato paste - no wonder people complain. Experienced cooks will know to make these modifications, but for those who follow the recipe exactly, this recipe needs better guidance.

I turned it down to medium and had to add water to prevent scorching, and that took more like 7 minutes. Next time I will be frying at a lower temp.   Also I used the whole batch of shallot paste with a full pound of pasta and it came out fine.

There has never been much error among all of the trials, but here are a couple of lessons learned: low and slow is best when caramelizing the shallots; do not get hung up on "is this considered a large or small shallot?" because an extra shallot or two is perfectly fine (and delicious); do not skip the fresh parsley & garlic mixture on top; and finally, a soft boiled egg right under that garnish of parsley & garlic is a truly heavenly addition.

A lot of work for a big disappointment.

It tasted mostly of the tins the ingredients came in and required an aggressive hand with seasoning at the end to make up for its one-dimensionality. There was no pleasure—no brightness—in this sauce. It was flat and dull. I used high-quality Italian tomato paste (DOP-certified, even) and nice anchovies and I felt like I wasted them. I love all of these ingredients, I went to culinary school; I did not mess up the recipe.

This is an entertainment worthy dish and really shows you how a few quality ingredients can really shine. We did add a light sprinkle of Parmesan on top of the garlic parsley mixture - delicious!!!

- **Comment Body:** If you have dried anchovies, you can grind it into powder which will help with blending the flavors into the dish. Anchovies do not have a strong fishy taste and are a great addition to this dish.   But if you're looking for a substitute, you can use kombu (dried kelp) sold in Asian grocery stores. Anchovies and kombu are typically used for creating the base for numerous Asian dishes. Just break off a small piece and cook out the flavor. Take out the kelp after you're done cooking.

I have also used the leftover sauce in recipes calling for tomato paste (like the Bon Appetit recipe for carmelized cabbage) and it makes everything better.

Sliced garlic thick so it wouldn’t burn. Used a generous amount of olive oil so the shallots fried. Used fettuccine - would use spaghetti next time. Used 6 Oz can of tomato paste - would recommend 4.5 oz next time. Used 2 cups pasta water to thin out the tomato paste - may not need that much if you use 4.5 oz. MUST make the parsley/garlic/salt mix - so good.

- **Comment Body:** This recipe is great, but as a person who really isn't into fish, I have to caution likeminded folks that the anchovy was very prominent for me, despite other commenters apparently not tasting it much. I was kinda bummed by how fishy it ended up being for me. Otherwise delicious, though, so it'll be worth it for me to try it out again using miso instead.   Even better with a drizzle of lemon juice before serving.

It was by no means difficult, but I wouldn’t say it was worth the effort.  Maybe I’ll give it another shot, but it wasn’t as interesting or, to be honest, as flavorful as I’d hoped.  Teetered on bland, and that’s unexpected given how “big” the ingredients are.

Perhaps my six shallots, which I considered large, weren't large enough?  (Here's where an estimate of the amount, either in cups or grams, would be helpful).  I found it really bland and uninteresting, and the five star rating really has me wondering what I did wrong.

- **Comment Body:** Some of us are allergic to anchovies! It’s not an aversion for everyone. Sometimes it’s trying to recapture the flavor of something that sounds amazing without having an anaphylactic reaction. So, that being said this recipe is amazing even just skipping them but benefits from some mushroom paste which I offended use to substitute for anchovies since I can’t have sea vegetables either which eliminates a lot of Miso pastes. Just in case that’s helpful for anyone else with an iodine allergy. ☺️

- **Comment Body:** I made this  as written and it was inedible. Shallots cooked on medium-high for 20 minutes don't just caramelize, they burn and taste acrid. A whole can of anchovies doesn't stay in the background, it becomes the foreground.  A whole 6 oz can of tomato paste is asking for heartburn. Adding flaky salt (on top of the anchovies) is asking for a stroke. Do the shallots at low heat and cut all the other ingredients by at least half and you'll have a reasonable sauce and live longer.

I used fresh pasta but for once I wish I used boxed in this case to have a bit more of an al dente texture. I finished it off by serving in the pot and drizzling with really good olive oil.

My advice is use more shallots than recommended so that you have tons of leftovers to play with. Do not skimp on the anchovies either, they melt into the other ingredients with no fishy taste just beautiful umami flavor. I followed the recipe almost religiously except that I added more olive oil if I thought the shallots were cooking to quick on medium high heat.

In any case this is a great question and worthy of expert discussion in many kitchen/culinary cases.

I finally found parsley and have been buying a shallot or two every time I saw them so I could eventually make this pasta. I found all the cooking times to be spot-on and even with layering salt and pepper I still could have used more salt at the end which is why the parsley, flake salt and garlic make so much sense.  Can’t wait to make again

The jammy texture and hint of sweetness strangely reminded me of pad Thai even though the flavors are very different. Next time I’ll add a bit more crushed red pepper.  If you, like me, question at the outset whether a full quarter cup of olive oil is necessary, I think it is.

Also add garlic in the last five minutes  to prevent burning.  Terrific with cauliflower steaks, started on a skillet on the stove top and finished in the oven.  Also really, really good with baked spaghetti squash.

Also, not every recipe is nor should be for everyone. Why people insist on making a dish with ingredients they don't like or don't eat is beyond me. Don't like anchovies? Then you can leave them out. But that's not the dish. You can sub olives for capers in a piccata. Will still be great. But again, not the dish.

I use the whole small can of tomato paste and add the garlic after the shallots are carmelized, so it doesn’t burn. And I use a pound of pasta and all the sauce. Don’t skip the pasta water step, it gives the sauce a velvety texture.   I don’t think it tastes fishy (I use Cento anchovies and drain the oil), but miso paste might be a good umami substitute.

### Recipe: Caramelized Shallot Pasta

- **Comment ID:** 111897219
- **User Display Name:** Alexandra
- **Comment Body:** This is a lot of shallots. Be prepped for your eyes to bleed like mine have been for the last two hours after cutting and sweating them. But this makes a delicious and frankly very easy pasta dish. Idk why some think it’s gods gift but it’s certainly good. Anyways, don’t sub the anchovies... that’s ridiculous. Make something else if you don’t like chovies. And don’t skip the pasta water, also important. A whole box of pasta or 1lb requires the whole sauce.

- **Comment Body:** Made this as per the recipe and was completely blown away by the flavours. Husband said that it was one of the best pasta dishes he has ever tasted. I wasn't sure about the size of shallots to use but I bought a bag of 500g (I'm based in Germany) and used the entire lot as I couldn't be bothered with leftovers. It seemed like a lot in the beginning but it reduced quite a bit in the caramelization process and turned out perfectly.

- **Comment Body:** This dish was a huge hit! So much so I made it twice within 4 days by request. I couldn’t find anchovies that weren’t in hot pepper so I used anchovy paste (1 Tbs) and it was great. The other change...I used all of the sauce for my 10oz. of pasta. I think only using half would’ve been too little.

Alison Roman is a great food person and this recipe is now in my regular rotation.  In fact, I will make it tomorrow evening . . . again.  No changes at all to the recipe ingredients; only I cook the shallots on a little lower flame.  Perfect

My grocery receipt said 0.7 lbs shallots for a mixed bag of 6, so 0.7 - 1 lb should be perfect.   Here’s my lil cost breakdown bc i couldn’t resist : $2.50 pappardelle pasta $1.25 shallots  $1.5 anchovies $0.50 fresh parsley  $1 spanish olive oil  $1 tomato paste $0.25 garlic  that’s 8 delicious dollars right there. go make it.

As for my Nonna (grandma), she had no issue keeping pasta sauce (reduced tomato) with meat (!) for 2 weeks! As long as it didn't get mould, it was perfectly fine to serve for the family (our family didn't get food poisoning) so in the end use your best judgement! :)

I pureed a can of diced tomatoes and used those instead, and just reduced them down as far as I could. I had to add more spices than normal, but it turned out surprisingly well.  I definitely prefer the original version, but if you really have to, this worked pretty all right.

Fantastic!!!  The cornmeal adds a very sophisticated "Italian" character to it, very slight crunch, and amazing flavor.  Topped with coarse sugar before baking.  Did this in a motorhome convection oven for 50 minutes.  Perfect dessert with whipped cream, flavored with a few pureed berries and sugar/vanilla.  So easy!

Added lemon zest and sliced slivered almonds.  Next time I would toss the plums in the lemon juice, lemon zest, sugar, almonds, and cinnamon, because the cinnamon and the zest clumped up when sprinkled.  Will also experiment with other fruits.

It can be made with any neutral vegetable oil too. Use any kind of nice fruit or berries, just make sure that they are firm, otherwise they can release too much juice during baking. Also, grease the the round or square pan, line the bottom with parchment and grease that one too. No springform required, but it's nice if you have one.

It freezes PHENOMENALLY well--her usual tactic is to wait until it's cool, then into the fridge, THEN when it's really cool you wrap it first in plastic wrap and then in foil REALLY well, like you're launching it into space, and then into the freezer.  Also works for leftover torte.  If you have more than 1 springform pan make 2 and freeze one for Emergency Company Cake.

It's a delicious, homey dessert you can bake in just about anything - though a springform pan does make for a somewhat ritzier presentation - and top with whatever fruit is in season. My Polish mother made it in a rectangular metal pan all summer long (mmm...placek!), though the household favorite WAS the Italian/prune plum iteration. She used grated lemon rind and 1 t. vanilla in the batter, tightly-spaced skin-side down fruit, and ground cloves instead of cinnamon atop.

I used a 9" pan and increased the recipe for the batter to 1 1/2 times.  Perfect.It only took 45 minutes to cook.  It would have burned if I'd left it an hour like it said.  I could smell it and tested with a toothpick and stopped at 45 minutes when it came out clean.

It blends much more smoothly that way.---I use whole wheat pastry flour, which is so finely ground that texture is the same but you have more fiber

But the possibility of using some flavorful liquids to soak the dried fruits (rum, brandy, triple sec, port, fruit juice) adds some intriguing possibilities. Soak the fruit for at least 4 hrs. and drain before using. This could turn into a great winter dessert...

- **Comment Body:** An additional quarter cup of almond meal (or flour) is useful if you have particularly juicy fruit. (I used some very fine apricots from Frog Hollow Farm.) Otherwise they tend to sink to the bottom. Additional sugar sprinkled on top of the fruit is a good idea if using abricots--vanilla sugar is ideal. Great recipe; thank you, New York Times.

- **Comment Body:** What I did differently from the above basic recipe was:Cut  plums into slivers, perhaps 8-10 slices out of a large plum.  Tumble them in a bowl where,  prepared in advance:  brown sugar, saigon cinnamon, & tiny bits of butter. Vanilla in the cake batter.    Then individually place each sliver in spirals to make an attractive design. If thin, overlap the slivers.    Sprinkled a bit more cinnamon on top.With the plums slivered it is easier to cut and neater to serve, plus looks attractive.

- **Comment Body:** This is a non-fussy, versatile European dessert. No need for butter, simple olive oil works fine. No need for a spring-form, any pan will do, just grease it (and perhaps dust with flour). The problem is the flour - the all-purpose flour is too finely ground to hold up in this cake and will make it gooey. 3/4 cup of all purpose and 1/4 cup of semolina flour works. Also, half a cup of sugar is enough. Finally, it will take less than 1 hour to bake at 350, do the first check at 40 minutes... Enjoy!

I sprinkled it with white sugar and fresh Meyer lemon juice and after it baked for an hour; Then sprinkled the top with sparkling sugar.  Fresh whipped, barely sweetened cream was a perfect accompaniment.  Delicious.  For those who are wondering, a good rule of thumb for a cup of flour is about 4.5 ounces.  You can measure then sift and mix.  4.5 ounces is 4.5 ounces so you'll never go wrong.

I went to the local market:  no italian plums, BUT, fresh, local figs.  I mixed up the batter, put it in a pie tin, laid the beautiful figs cut side up, brushed them with some white balsamic, and sprinkled them with a little bit of sugar.  It was a huge hit!

Do not peel or blanch them. They become luscious jewels when baked. The real original recipe keeps well if well wrapped for many months in the freezer. Abandon any effort to sub ingredients to reduce calories. Just eat a smaller portion of something more delicious. Really simple.

As the cake bakes, the batter puffs up around the fruit.  If you nestle the plums in too deeply you won't be able to see them on the top of the finished cake.

Depending on plum size, it may not require 24 (in fact, it rarely does). Freezes beautifully. I do use the cinnamon--it does not overpower in this recipe. In my view, it is the best "coffee cake" and simple dessert ever--not too sweet, deeply flavorful.Thanks, Cooking, for putting the recipe in a place where it is easy to retrieve.

It may well be good with any "purple plum" but in my culinary repertoire, it is treasured because of the very limited availability of the Italian prune plums.

- **Comment Body:** I made this one yesterday and it was delicious. I recommend cutting plums in quarters as it's easier to eat, AND (the most important) to use only 1/2 cup of sugar. I used cane sugar, which is sweeter, I think, but anyway 3/4 or even 1 cup (sic!) is definitely too much. Cake was really sweet already even though I used italian prune plums which were rather sour. I know Americans like their cakes very sweet but trust me. Next time I'll do it with 50% of almond meal as someone suggested.

- **Comment Body:** I clipped this recipe out of the paper years ago and made it for a gathering of my soon-to-be-husband's family. I didn't have a spring form pan and wasn't about to buy one; I used a cake pan. Didn't matter. It's delicious! No wonder people protested its "retirement." I haven't tried it, but I imagine it would work with other fruits as well.

I have memories of my Mom cutting circles out of the shirt cardboard from my late father's laundered shirts for this purpose.

I'm not a fan of cinnamon on plums so I omitted that and the lemon juice and added half a teaspoon each of almond and vanilla extracts.  And I used one-fourth a cup of almond flour (ground almonds) in lieu of equivalent amount of flour.  Vey happy with the results.

I find that one egg makes the topping a bit crunchy and almond extract works great with pears and peaches and some dried cherries are always a great mix with fresh fruit.  Lately, I've been using crushed salted hazelnuts mixed with brown sugar and cinnamon as a topping. Brava Marion Burros!

Instead of cinnamon I added a very light sprinkling of cardamom.Looking forward to trying other readers' combinations. The cornmeal suggestion sounds interesting.

None of the times I used more than 5 or 6 plums/apricots.

It automatically reduces the temp to compensate for the convection and bakes a perfect torte.  You want it to bake long enough to really cook the plums which is what brings out their sweet goodness.  I'd rather bake a little lower and longer than hotter and shorter.

- **Comment Body:** I love this recipe and its versatility. My favorite version for winter: I substitute 1/4 cup almond flour for 1/4 cup of the plain flour and use frozen whole cranberries that are gently microwaved until they are soft but not giving off any juice. I fold the cranberries into the mixture before baking in an 8" buttered and floured pan with a removable bottom. It bakes for at least an hour until the top is crisp. The result is denser and chewier than the original, with pleasing pops of tart berries

Technique, all other ingredients remain the same. Add the almond extract with the rest of the ingredients. The tooth of the cornmeal references an Italian homemade everyday cake. I also start checking the torte at around 35 minutes in a 9” springform that I grease and flour.

- **Comment Body:** 1. Replace the plums with almost any seasonal fruit: apricots, halved and pitted; cranberries or any summer berry; sliced apples, nectarines, peaches and pears. Canned and frozen fruit can stand in for fresh. 2. Experiment with spices, herbs and extracts: vanilla extract (1/2 tsp), almond extract, nutmeg, ginger, cardamom, rosemary, orange or lemon zest. 3. Play with the flours. You can add almond or cornmeal flour to the all-purpose flour, or swap in gluten-free flour blends, with excellent res

### Recipe: Original Plum Torte

- **Comment ID:** 113833892
- **User Display Name:** Sharon
- **Comment Body:** I've made this with a wide variety of fruit.  Especially successful - wild sweet cherries, black currants, raspberries.  I find that it can support about 2 cups of fruit, which is way more helpful than a specific number of an unspecified type of plum!  I often skip the cinnamon and add in lemon zest.   This cake turns out quite slim in a 9" pan, so for my most recent version, I doubled the batter and did it in a 9" springform.  It took longer to bake of course, but it had the height I was after.

- **Comment Body:** I've made this torte about 60 times -- and there is no way you can use the original recipe in a 10" springform.  You have to double it.   As for plums -- it works with blueberries; peaches, nectarines, very thinly sliced apples, it's fabulous with pears too. You can add 1 tsp of almond extract; or the grated rind of one lemon; or vanilla.  The possibilities are endless.  But you can't make it successfully "as is" in a 10".

My only changes were lemon zest added to the batter and a sprinkle of almond slivers on top with the sugar, lemon and cinnamon topping.... So yummy.

Spray both pan and parchment.  Enjoy!

You don't need a spring pan. You don't need plums. I have greased and floured a cake pan and used whatever fruit was available. It comes out perfect every time - every single time. In the summer I will make several and freeze them for the dark days of winter. This is the most perfect, most fool proof recipe on earth. Just make it.

- **Comment Body:** I made this at a friend's mountain house (10,000 feet). I live at sea level, so this was daunting, and I was making gluten-free for the host. There was no electric mixer or sifter, so I hand-creamed the butter/sugar, and used a whisk to "sift" the flour. I used gluten-free AP flour, cut baking powder to 3/4 teaspoon, cut sugar to 3/4 cup, and added water until batter was not a clump. I increased oven temp to 375 deg. and decreased cooking time to 45 min. It turned out beautifully.

- **Comment Body:** The plums should be placed skin side DOWN - as in your original recipe. Not skin side UP as in the above recipe. Putting them skin up let's the juices run into the cooking batter. Not ideal, but there are worse things in life. Having made my point, the torte still works this way. It's the difference between a Crosstrek (it'll get you where you want to go... and a Lexus...you'll think you floated to your destination). Thank you.

### Recipe: Original Plum Torte

- **Comment ID:** 136193523
- **User Display Name:** Boehker
- **Comment Body:** Marian Burros’s original recipe specified the use of 12 Italian prune plums (24 halves) and called for a 9-inch springform pan.  Italian plums are much smaller than standard plums, and are usually available only at the end of summer to early fall.  That’s why this torte is seen at this time of the year.  You can use other plums, but if they are larger than the small prune plums you won’t need 24 halves.  (Vaughn Vreeland’s video of this recipe on the Times Cooking app comments on how crazy it would be to use 24 large halves, but never mentions the original intention of using prune plums!).  Just saying, because I remember the original printing, and that recipe came out pretty much “plumb perfect”.

I only used 1/2 cup of sugar and 20 minutes into baking drizzled a little honey on top. Baked for a total of 45 minutes in a lightly greased pyrex 9-inch pie plate. Turned out amazing!

Adjust oil to a little less than required of butter. Last time I chopped 3 granny smith apples (for a double batch) and folded them into the batter before pouring into a 9x13 glass pan. Added cinnamon & vanilla extract.That was the best version yet.

- **Comment Body:** I have a memory of my great aunt serving me a plum cake, and this recipe is the closest I have found to the taste I recall. Only, I remember hers as being fairly thick, whereas this one makes quite a thin cake -- in fact, every plum torte recipes seems to. I like your idea of just increasing the amount of batter! The only thing is, when I used to make this cake, the fruit stayed on top, and recently it has been sinking, so I think I need to ensure the batter is on the thicker side.

Err on the side of more plums and use excess for another purpose, like eating while the torte bakes.  I've made this a dozen times and it never fails.  As others have noted, it doubles nicely.

I used 4 plums which I quartered, not halved, I was afraid they would be too difficult to eat. All my worry was for naught. This is definitely a keeper recipe. The plums cooked up beautifully with a jammy consistency, the skins weren't a problem. Just a perfect recipe. I used the 3/4 c. sugar range and still great. Perfection!

- **Comment Body:** I've made this Torte numerous times using different fruits but my favorite is the original made with Zwetschgen or what  in my hood is called "Italian plums". As peaches are in season now and Zwetschgen are not, I've made several and they are delicious.  I blanche the peaches to remove the skin and use them as I would the plums. I tend towards less sugar so I opt for the 3/4 cup.  This batter is very stiff so I find using wet fingers to spread it helpful.

- **Comment Body:** I think NYT Cooking staff should add a tip on the plums—that if they’re smaller, then 12 is ideal but if your grocery store has only idk just regular plums, 10 might be pushing it. Also a note on the sturdiness of the plum…plums that are kind of soft (so 60-40 sturdy-soft) or softer can really ruin what would otherwise be a great and easy to make cake. Because I’m pretty disappointed (mostly in me but there is no reason to not have something more instructive, even if a simple recipe.)

- **Comment Body:** Regarding when to sift flour: the comma will tell you. For - 1 cup flour, sifted - that will mean to sift after measuring. If it’s to be sifted first, it should read - 1 cup sifted flour - . Of course that depends on the recipe bring correctly written.  That goes for most anything, I.e., - 1 cup nuts, chopped - vs. - 1 cup chopped nuts - . And yes, that tiny comma makes a huge difference.

- **Comment Body:** Followed NYT contributor "Marty"'s suggestions: slice 6 plums thinly, toss with lemon juice, lemon zest, sugar and cinnamon. Fan it out on top of batter, skin on side, in two concentric circles.  Then add about 1/4 cup of slivered almonds. Use a 9" springform pan, greased and floured, also lined w/parchment paper & greased. Cook for 40 minutes at 350 degrees convection oven (read 325), then switched heat off and left in oven another 20 minutes. Test for doneness w/toothpick. Used GF flour.

Which I don’t. I used a glass 9x9 and It came out just like the photo but square.  If it seems like too many plums don’t worry. Just keep cramming them in. It’ll all work out!

It also freezes great.

I also used regular plums, because that was all I can find, and I discovered you need far fewer of them than of the smaller dark plums. The full amount of sugar was not too sweet; it seemed just about perfect. All in all, very easy and exceptionally good.

After much research, I used King Arthur Measure for Measure GF flour which seemed the most straight forward, no adjusting/converting. Based on other reviews, I used 1/3 cup medium coarse cornmeal and 2/3 cup flour. I added a bit of candied ginger to the batter. Otherwise followed recipe exactly. Baked for about 55 mins ( in uneven oven) and it was perfect texture. Crazy good, crazy gorgeous.

The purple plums were sweeter than the yellow plums and we all liked that flavor better. Made with 3/4 cup sugar.

- **Comment Body:** The timing is strictly a function of how hot your oven runs.  If everyone owned a thermometer and calibrated their ovens, the discussion about timing would be moot.  Mine (an almost 30 year old GE) right now has two temperatures, regardless of setting.  Warm and incinerate.  And, the size of the springform, also, has an impact on the bake time.

The problem seemed was that there were not enough plums although I followed the 24 halves and then added four more. I am in France – and when a recipe says so many of a thing, like apples, oranges, or plums, I forget that the accepted size is so much bigger in the States. Giving only a number of anything that is variable is not helpful – can't we have weights that will tell us what we really should. use?

Added 1 teaspoon almond extract to the batter and sprinkled a handful of blanched sliced almonds over the peaches and then the cinnamon and sugar over that. Skipped the lemon juice and didn't miss it. 40 minute bake was perfect. Always fun to play with this recipe!

You didn't use regular flour, you substituted with date sugar, used a gluten free flour and possibly no eggs or an egg substitute? Did you use butter?  I'm not a proponent of white sugar or white flour, both are inflammatory and not healthy. At the same time, if you change a recipe so much that it doesn't resemble the original it isn't surprising that it won't be good.

Once it came to a boil, I turned off the heat and let the prunes rehydrate.  Then i stuffed each prune with a wee nugget of almond paste and placed it on the cake.  Also added a wee dram of almond extract to the dough.  It literally brought tears to my eyes.

While filling a 9" pyrex pie dish with the batter, I realized that I forgot the sugar.Rather than start from scratch, I sprinkled the sugar over the batter and using my fingers pressed as much sugar into the batter as possible. Then I added a mix of strawberries and raspberries. Baked for 1 hour. Terrific! A torte rouge everyone loved.

- **Comment Body:** Nothing to change, just don't use plums that are too ripe.  (The tartness gives it a more interesting flavor.) I've made this for people all over the world and they've loved it everywhere.  It seems too simple to be so good.  It freezes surprisingly well, so when plums are in season I make multiple recipes. Of course,it is better fresh out of the oven, but it works from the freezer as well.

- **Comment Body:** This was so easy to make and so delicious. My changes: I used only 1/2 cup sugar, I added vanilla, I used 3/4 cup white flour and 1/4 cup cornmeal. I wouldn't call it a torte - it's more of a homey style dessert. The fruit topping makes a nice presentation for when guests come over. Leftovers are great for breakfast!

- **Comment Body:** The Italian prune plums have become very hard to come by.  They are in the grocery stores for about two weeks in the fall.  Specifically when they appear changes every years due to the levels of rainfall and temperature during their growing season.  Plus there seems to be fewer and fewer orchards doing them.   Its become almost a crap shoot to be able to find them unless you are literally in your grocery store every other day.

- **Comment Body:** since the recipe calls for 8T butter, and it yields 8 servings, the total fat = 1  T per serving, the best way to reduce fat (and I wouldn't go more than 50% is to replace 4T butter with an equal amount of either prune butter *complementary flavor* or unsweetened applesauce.  If you do prune/plum butter (has no fat, btw) reduce sugar accordingly.  Or, add one more egg, and reduce butter by 4T.  Texture will be different, but won't compromise the taste.

Over time I have tweaked the recipe, and found ways to make it easier to bake multiple cakes to freeze if there is a good crop of prune plums locally. A little almond extract in the batter, and cardamom sprinkled on top of the plums along with the cinnamon works very well. Also sometimes just use pie plate lined with parchment paper to bake. Easy!

- **Comment Body:** The recipe calls for 24 purple plums but what it really means is 24 ITALIAN PLUMS which are much smaller than most of the plums seen in the supermarket most of the year.  Regular (non-Italian) plums work great but ;you only need about 10.  If some are left over, eat plums.  I've also made this with frozen peaches and blueberries.  The focus of this recipe is really the very simple batter.

- **Comment Body:** This recipe was recently featured, why not update it to include weights? A cup of flour should be 120g but it could be anything from 110g to 150g depending on the person sifting it, scooping it and measuring it.   Likewise for many of us half a cup of butter isn't meaningful. Where I live butter doesn't come in half cup sticks, it comes in 8 blocks. Half a cup of butter is 4 oz or 113g. I know this is an older recipe but it doesn't take much time to update it especially given that it is popular.

Marian Burros’s  recipe always called for Italian prune plums but doesn’t in this update, yet they’re essential. Other purple plums are too large and probably sweeter—not what’s needed in an already sweet cake.

Delicious, light, a little chewy around the edges. Made it a second time but substituted 1/4 cup of almond flour for some of the GF flour. Also added a tablespoon of a local nut liqueur  to enhance that stone fruit/almond pairing. Again, delicious. Got a little darker on top but not quite burnt. Would keep a closer eye on it next time.

It is a dump cake...no need to separate the wet ingredients from the dry, so it comes together in a flash. Then place the fruit on the cake--and you can use so many kinds of fruit. I've used figs, plums, peaches, apricots. Our fig tree is overproducing and I've been making all kinds of desserts with them. The first three cakes I made were okay and then I remember this one and problem solved.

The proportions of ingredients in this recipe (flour, butter, sugar, eggs, baking powder, salt) are the same as endless other good cake recipes with fruit, because it is perfect. But, 1-2 Tbls of booze (brandy is my go-to) gives it a fabulous French touch.

### Recipe: Original Plum Torte

- **Comment ID:** 136259112
- **User Display Name:** Cathy
- **Comment Body:** I used Italian plums and only used about 7 since it seemed too crowded in my 8-inch springform pan to add more.  I regret not cramming in the remaining 5 plums because, boy, did they shrink.  To be sure, the torte was still awesome but I’m sure it’s even better with more plums.  As for modifications, I added lemon zest to the batter as per some reviews and baked for only 45 minutes, which was enough time to complete the baking.  Will make again soon!

- **User Display Name:** Zach A.
- **Comment Body:** Super delish! Although the recipe was missing some info. could be more precise with the size of the pan related to how many plums are needed. I used an 8" and had twice as many plums left over. (warning, do not eat all these plums. Remember, they're juicy prunes) It doesn't say if the plums should be stacked. So I didn't. When cooked, they were buried. Next, when placing the plums in the pan, do you stack them? I did this recipe again with a bigger pan and stacked them the 2nd time and too high.

- **Comment Body:** The old Joy of Cooking  listed a version of this recipe.  Alternate fruits including peaches were suggested as well. I tried peaches, but they were a little too watery -- Maybe a kettle pre-cooking or macerating with sugar to get rid of some of the liquid would work? or, using less ripe fruit??

Nectarine slices can be placed between the plum halves. Sprinkled powdered sugar and cinnamon on top for a perfect glaze. At 55 minutes, turned the heat down to 300 deg.; at exactly 1 hour, turned off the heat and left standing in oven for 2 minutes.I'll be making this every other weekend this fall. Thanks!

Made it in a 9" springform  but would not make it again in anything larger than an 8 inch  because I prefer more cake on the bottom. Doubling into 9x13 is fine. Versatile - ingredients I always have on hand.Any season - any fruit will do

I macerated mine in a quarter cup of sugar for about 12 hours (which yielded a lovely pink syrup for “quarentini” experiments) and I suspect that could have helped preserve the vibrant ruby color but was unnecessary. With almost an hour in the oven the rhubarb will soften beautifully and provide a tart foil for the rich batter.

Added lemon zest and sliced slivered almonds. Next time I would toss the plums in the lemon juice, lemon zest, sugar, almonds, and cinnamon, because the cinnamon and the zest clumped up when sprinkled. Will also experiment with other fruits.

I used six for a 9-inch springform pan and cut them in quarters. That was just the right amount, although I had bought nine plums. So today's version will be plums and peaches!  For dessert night I made whipped cream with some Chambord liqueur in it to add a little black raspberry kick. AND with some crystallized ginger pieces on top of that, a truly elegant dessert!

- **Comment Body:** I've made this numerous times, with many different type of flours, and it always comes out delicious and beautiful.  Two weeks ago I moved to southern Africa, and am spending a Covid Christmas here. Plums are in season, so I thought this would be the perfect antidote for a cloudy day and a lousy year.  Despite having very limited cooking gear (no measuring spoons, a vastly underpowered hand beater, metric measures and a Celsius oven, after a bit of math this little beauty came through as usual!

- **Comment Body:** This is incredibly versatile.  This weekend I made it with peeled peaches, and 1 tsp of almond extract.  While it was still warm, I glazed it with strained raspberry jam (that you have to heat to melt, and then pour on).  Brilliant.   It's great with blueberries, plums, and i've done it with apples too.  HOWEVER this recipe must be doubled if you're considering a 10" pan.

Also, to save a step, just melt the butter, mix it with the sugar, dump the rest of the ingredients onto the bowl and mix well.  Comes out just as good as creaming the B and S.

I make this cake once a month for the last couple of years using every type of fruit from fresh blueberries and plums, to canned (drained, and dried off peaches, and pineapple.). The canned fruit won't get wonky as fast as the fresh will.  But if you make it on Sunday, refrigerate the leftovers by Tuesday night.

Used a 10 inch springform pan (no spray) and 6 plums. It turned out great.  Next time I will bump the sugar down to 1/2 cup though.  It was a tad too sweet with 3/4 cup.

- **Comment Body:** To summarize best advice from comments below which made my tart perfect: - slice plums so can make designs - don't push in - cannot have too many plums and do not worry if they are still hard - mix plums with lemon juice and spices (cardamom instead of cinnamon?) and slivered almonds in a bowl before you lay out - avoids clumps from just putting spices on top - grease pan, no matter which type of pan -- for thicker tart make 1 1/2 times batter -- cook only 55 minutes, a bit undercooked is yummy.

- **Comment Body:** The recipe should indicate that it calls for Italian plums which are much smaller than the usual larger plums we see in the supermarket.  So, if there are no Italian plums, adjust the number accordingly.  With the larger plums, you'll only need half. But, then again, too much is never enough.

- **Comment Body:** You can't.  The recipe actually uses small Italian plums, not the ones that are usually on hand in the markets except in season.  If using the larger plums, figure out how many halves or slices you'll need, buy extra just in case and you'll do fine.  I've also made this with frozen peach slices and it came out great.

- **Comment Body:** I make this regularly with a seasonal combination of plums, peaches, blueberries, cranberries, pear and apple. I only use 1/2 cup sugar in the batter! If I’m using sour fruit I go heavy on the sugar sprinkle… but even 3/4 is too sweet for us. With less you taste the fruit more clearly. I always double the recipe and freeze one torte- it’s great to thaw and serve for a brunch or bring to someone’s house. For a dinnertime dessert I sprinkle with powdered sugar or serve with crème fraiche.

One small change from the recipe, I place all or at least half of the plums cut side up. Looks prettier and the juices don't seep too much into the batter. Avoids sogginess, especially when using soft ripe plums.

This recipe has a couple of notes that claimed success with substituting a 1 t0 1 gluten free product.  I tried Bob's Red Mill 1 to 1 using raspberries. It was barely acceptable. I tried again using super fine sugar, added eggs before adding flour, and it was tastier, a little more height, and, more importantly, the recipient was very happy!

I have considered substituting peaches or apricots, but haven't had to resort to desperate measures yet; the right plums materialize just in time. I have successfully substituted cognac and rum for the lemon juice and will try an eeldeerflower liquor one of these days. I made the torte into individual cakes to pack for a picnic supper.

But I ran out of white sugar and topped with demera and that made a crunchy topping where the plum was not. So that is a tough choice.  Ps Canadians will ALWAYS add the salt to baking.

FORGOT:  Lemon zest, cinnamon or cardamon sugar on top, Bake to internal temp of 200 degrees F.

- **Comment Body:** Good for a change. The batter is a sort of cobbler type rather than a torte (or cake) batter. I used a 9" springform pan. The THICK batter gets SPOONED into the pan. I cut the plums into fan-like slices and added a few slices of peaches,too (because they were here and fresh). I liked the simplicity and quick prep.  Based on other cooking notes, I checked the pan at 45 minutes, left it in a few minutes longer.  It's a nice addition to the recipe repertoire and amenable to changes.

In the end, I'm glad I just followed it to fidelity. It was delicious! Like others mentioned - my plums were MUCH bigger - so I only used 5 (10 halves). I used a 9" springform and it definitely looked like there wouldn't be enough batter, but I spread it out and dropped my plum halves in, skin-side up, as directed. It rose beautifully and mine was ready in 45 minutes.

- **Comment Body:** I agree, I wrote a comment that wasn't posted asking that they update the recipe. I understand that this is an older recipe but they are showcasing it again. It shouldn't be difficult to put 120g (1 cup) of flour unless they mean it to be more or less and 4 ounces of butter. Where I live butter doesn't come in "sticks" it comes in 8 ounce blocks. It's better to avoid confusion and provide the weights for ingredients.

I just made two of these - one in a Bundt pan (turbinado sugar), one in a regular 9" round cake pan (plain white sugar). The batter was so thick, I was sure I had messed it up somehow, but they look and smell amazing and I can't wait to compare! Hooray!

- **Comment Body:** I made this recipe using Bob's Red Mill One to One Gluten Free flour mix. I cut back on the sugar to less than 3/4 cup. I used slices of plums (2) on the top of the torte because I was afraid the GF flour batter would get far too soggy using plum halves. The torte took about 40 minutes to bake in a 9-inch round pan. It was perfectly done and really wonderful. I will use more fruit next time as I experiment with the GF version. Two big thumbs up for this recipe!

- **Comment Body:** My plums sunk also and I am an experienced baker. I followed the recipe, weighed the flour (1 cup is 120g) and used softened butter. It isn't your failure. I think the recipe uses a "dipped" cup of flour which is considerably more than 120g. You might try increasing the flour to 150g and quartering the plums. I baked mine for 45 minutes at a true 350º in a ten inch springform pan. I hope you read this comment and don't feel bad! It was delicious but it was more of a cobbler than a torte.

- **Comment Body:** First of all, every cake tastes better when you make a yeast dough. It is really not that hard and will make a big difference. Put the plums on top of the dough next to each other, no gaps. I also suggest to make crumbles out of butter, flour and sugar(just mix in a bowl with a folk) and top the cake with them. This is the way my mother in law back in Germany used to make it and she learned it from her mother, we are going back to 1880 now...

It also works well with peaches, nectarines, blueberries and/or peeled apple slices.

Using 325 convection they cooked in 35 minutes with the batter almost covering the plum. Eaten warm, it was a great breakfast on a cool late summer morning. Made exactly as originally written. And yes, you can go to 3/4 cup sugar in the batter as the sprinkle of sugar on the top provides a nice hit of sweet.

- **Comment Body:** I make this often-no need for a springform pan. Butter and flour an ordinary 9” round cake pan then line the bottom with parchment. Run a butter knife around the sides when it comes out of the oven, cool 5 minutes, then unmold. Never had a problem with sticking. Don’t agonize over weighing the flour-recipe is very forgiving. Use ANY fruit or berry and don’t be skimpy-cover the top of the batter. Cinnamon doesn’t go with fruits, so add 1 1/2 t vanilla to batter, and sprinkle with coarse sugar before baking.

Separating the eggs and folding the whipped whites in makes for a much lighter, delicate crumb. Also, I think placing the plum halves skin side down and pressing them into the batter until level with the batter, then dusting with sugar makes for a much better presentation.

Still bake it every year, but now I use half  “white” whole wheat flour and add a tiny splash of milk b/c w.w flour requires more hydration. Lots of leeway with this recipe. Its beauty is its simplicity. Some of the notes here bring tears to my eyes.

ANYway, don't be afraid to make this with other fruit.  I tend to use concentric circles of different berries pushed slightly into the batter.  Yes, use that sprinkling of sugar on top for raspberries or, well, just for any fruit mix.

This time I used a half cup of all purpose flour and a half cup of almond flour and added a half teaspoon of almond extract plus some ginger and cardamom. It was fully cooked after 45 minutes. The plums on top mostly sank into the cake so it wasn’t so beautiful visually but it was moist and absolutely delicious. A fabulous classic recipe!

Both can be done ahead and held in the refrigerator (cooled & covered) without deteriorating. Just before serving, reheat the stew, marinate the shrimp, saute the shrimp in butter just until they turn pink and then add them to the stew. The shrimp will be tender and the stew will be perfect.

My husband felt it needed more beans, so next time I make it, I will use two cans. I sautéed the shrimp in two batches to avoid overcrowding the pan. I also made some penne rigate as I thought rigatoni is too large. The rigate was the perfect size and a good addition to add some heft for those wanting a heavier meal. Definitely a keeper.

- **Comment Body:** This is the rare recipe that I could smell and taste as I read it. I made it for my family tonight. They were wowed. I served it over linguine with torn, toasted French bread to sop the juice. I made one change. I wanted the lemon juice in the marinade. So I put it in with the shrimp marinade and reserved it. When the recipe calls to add the lemon juice, I added the reserve marinade. The whole recipe took about an hour, not 30 minutes. But one of the best.

- **Comment Body:** Oh, yum! Made this tonight in about an hour, served with crusty bread and a good pinot noir. Flavors are bold, rich and satisfying, the beans add heft and creaminess and the lemon juice adds a fine note of brightness. I increased the lemon zest to the entire lemon's worth (about a Tablespoon) because I love that flavor and decreased the salt and pepper added to the shrimp to 1/2 teaspoon each, which to my taste was plenty. This is so good, the two of us almost finished it off!

I also made a quick stock with the shrimp tails, and supplemented it with a bit of veggie broth to make 2 cups instead of using chicken broth, but otherwise followed the recipe. We loved it, and it came together quickly.

Followed another reader’s advice to use the tails to make a stock with the shells, white wine, celery leaves, carrots and lemon peel.  I added this to part chicken broth and part water.  I also added a bit more of the beans than called for (I made mine from dry beans simmered with a rind of Parmesan and bay leaf and garlic).  I have to say this recipe was outstanding.  Served over pasta and it was delicious but I’ll use the grilled bread next!

Marinated shrimp and bay scallops in 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika, garlic, salt, pepper, lemon zest and juice; did not cook separately but added to broth and beans to cook near the end. Two cups of broth is just right, especially as I used more beans. Added some preserved lemon and a dollop of harissa, fresh dill and basil.

Shrimp w/sweet paprika. Added baby spinach to off-heat pot, just so it wilted. Very nice! Quick too.

We also add a bunch of kale or other greens before the beans. Once the greens are wilted, just keep on with the recipe as written. A little extra lemon juice won’t hurt either. And our toasted bread has garlic, Parmesan, and herbs. Great dish. Having it again tonight.

Since I got this recipe mixed up with the summer shrimp scampi which was right next to it, I threw in the corn kernels from the corn I had bought for tte other recipe. Great addition.

- **Comment Body:** I roasted a pint of cherry tomatoes in olive oil and garlic cloves for an hour or so before. They caramelize nicely and can be added when you add the shrimp back in at the end. Similarly, I roasted the the leeks for a bit in the oven to soften them. Lastly, I’d also recommend adding an additional can of beans, and smashing some in the pot to get a nice consistency.

I blended about a quarter of the beans and stock putting my immersion blender directly in the pot a couple of minutes before adding the shrimp. This gave the broth a velvety texture. So yummy! It’s definitely going in the weekly rotation!

I put the cooked shrimp in the stew and reduced the sauté liquid by half,  squeezed an extra lemon over all at the end. (Lemon olive oil was a great addition.) I would use dried beans next time and watch how long they cooked carefully.

Made with shrimp it was bright, rich, and had a nice combination of textures. Made with cod it was under-seasoned and the texture of cod and beans made it kind of boring.  Lesson: Use shrimp. If you've got cod, find another recipe.

- **Comment Body:** Perfect. This is one of those recipes that’s truly greater than the sum of its parts, and it comes together shockingly quickly. I wanted to add white wine as some have suggested but didn’t have any. I did find the broth needed a tiny bit of sweetness so I added a pinch of sugar. The result was great but I think white wine would have served this purpose and more. I also halved the shrimp since it was just two of us but used a whole can of beans. We devoured the entire pot with French bread.

### Recipe: Lemony Shrimp and Bean Stew

- **Comment ID:** 131742728
- **User Display Name:** Amanda
- **Comment Body:** Delicious. Doubled cannellini beans. Otherwise as suggested.   Next time with shrimp I’ll use a veggie stock. Chicken was a bit overpowering for shrimp for me. But fish stock would be too fishy.   I used the chilled down  over white bean stew  (having picked out all the prawns!) as a cold  salad as  a side salad for avocado on grilled ciabatta. Delicious. I’m more likely to create the base with all the spices and lemon juice that went into the marinade and add my protein of choice on the day.

- **Comment Body:** First time I've bought leeks in my life, so worth it.  Used wild NC shrimp we had in the freezer, and modified only to add a second can of beans, and a bag of baby spinach for color and iron content. I also just sauteed the shrimp in another pan at the end rather than par-cooking them, either would work, but I did it my way.

Instead of forming a loaf, I spooned tablespoon sized balls on a baking sheet. Baked for 10 mins at 350. Came out tasting like chocolate chip cookies!!! Not sure what I did wrong. Maybe a little more tweaking will help.I'm kidding, but you didn't follow a single thing from the original recipe. Your comment has nothing to do with Bittman's recipe.

The next day I take out a large handful/grapefruit sized amount of dough, shape it and let it rise on the counter on a lightly floured silpat covered with a kitchen towel for 1-2 hours depending on how much time I have. Follow the preheat directions and use the silpat to transfer the dough to the pot. You'll have dough for days and it will taste more complex as days pass.

But when it's time to bake, I pick it up by the 4 corners of the parchment and just plop the whole thing into my preheated Creuset Dutch oven, put on the lid, and bake as directed. The parchment peels off easily after baking. The crust is amazingly crisp and the crumb is like in the picture. Just had some with supper tonight.

- **Comment Body:** For those looking to improve the flavor, try slowing the rise!Cooler temperatures encourage bacterial fermentation, converting starches to sugars that result in a more complex flavor.After shaping the loaf in step 3, try refrigerating the dough overnight, then allow 6-8 hours at room temperature for the final rise, instead of 2.It increases the time from 24 hours to as much as 48 (or more), but you'll never know unless you try...I also prefer more salt.

I just tried the recipe according to the video using 1.5C of water, 430g of flour. Oven at 500. Loaf is taller, crust is more caramelized. What a difference. My only mod was to skip the towel. I use a very lightly oiled bowl for final rise. Works great. Dough stands taller and slides nicely into Dutch oven.

Honey as a sweetener. 1 tb vinegar. I form the loaf on oiled parchment and use a pie plate for that rise. The parch,net becomes a sling to move the dough from the plate to the heated pot. I've also used a long covered clay pot to bake the bread to get a long loaf. The parchment helps with that too.

- **Comment Body:** The advantage of using weight in baking is that flour's density changes depending on how tightly it's packed and some other factors so a cup of flour doesn't always contain the same amount of flour. Measuring flour by weight ensures that you're getting the exact amount the recipe calls for every time.Using weight also has a convenience factor. You can just keep putting ingredients in the same bowl and setting the scale back to zero which saves a bunch of clean up

A variation I like the best substitutes rye flour for 25% of the flour and adds 150 grams of red miso to the water. Just add water or flour if the mix is too stiff or too sticky. I like the idea of oiling a stainless bowl for the rise and then pouring the dough into the dutch oven. Score the top of the dough, add a handful of ice cubes around the edge, put the lid on to add some steam in the pot to boost the initial rise.

A few days in the fridge before the second rise makes a loftier, more complex loaf. I usually prefer the second, "aged" loaf.

At 08:00 scraped it carefully onto an oiled & floured springform and baked it right after per temp\time directions.  And, yes, that leaves out the risky hot-pan manipulation (sigh of relief): With a lightweight springform there isn't really a drawback in not having it preheated. So, having it sit longer isn't needed to taste great.

If you use "active dry" yeast (which is different) you have to activate it first, Take about a 1/4 cup of the water from the recipe, heat it to about 110 degrees, and *twice* the amt of yeast (1/2 tsp) and a tsp of sugar. Wait for a few minutes--it if foams and bubbles, it's active and you can then add it along with the water to the flour.

When I pull out the hot dutch oven to put my dough in, I lift it up and place it into the D.O. by the sling.  I don't worry about getting burned now, and my dough doesn't sink from the violent toss into the pan.  If you use the sling method, be quick and fluid in your motions.  If you go slowly the dough can fall off of the parchment sling.  Hope this helps.

With the less dense ones my dough becomes far too wet with the 1 and 5/8 cups of water. I have found that  when my cups of flour weigh about 146g/cup the process is far easier than when they weigh about 130 g/cup. From now on I will be weighing out 440g of flour as a surrogate for 3 cups.

- **Comment Body:** It seemed like some commenters were put off by the idea of using rapid-rise or quick yeast.Most of the time, a product labeled "quick" never comes into my kitchen: I have no desire to pay extra for a product that promises convenience but yields an inferior result.Not so with a rapid-rise yeast! It simply has a much lower percentage of dead yeast cells.

- **Comment Body:** I've been making this bread for years, using Lahey's recipe. I weigh the flour (430 grams), use 1 1/2 c. water, 1 1/2 tsp fine sea salt, and 1/4 tsp yeast.  The loaf turns out perfectly every time. I bake it in my Le Creuset dutch oven. I have perfected moving the dough from the cornmeal dusted towel (less sticking that way) to the hot pot by gathering up the towel around the dough & doing a quick 180 flip of my wrists which flips the dough into the pot. My bread bakes in a total of 45 minutes.

I make it usually with 2 cups bread flour and 1 all purpose.  I would like a larger loaf, but think I would screw up the proportion of yeast if I messs with it.  Help me Mark.

The problem with the higher temp is that the enamel on many dutch ovens will melt at 500 as mine did.  I bought a cast iron without enamel and the bread is perfection with an even harder crust due to the higher temperature.

It rose well, behaved a lot like gluten-full bread dough, and had a nice texture when kneading. I baked it in a heavy cast iron pan- I realized I didn't have anything to cover it, so I baked it with the top open. OMG, the flavor and texture are good! There is a wonderful sour note, texture is good and it holds together. What a treat after not making bread for years.

This recipe does not make a normal bread dough. When you let it rise it’ll look dry and well... shaggy. The slow rise will take care of the rest. The next day after 3 folds it’s a beautiful ball and will continue its second rise. This truly is effortless, don’t give up!

For those who are a little shy about dropping the dough into a 500 degree pot,you can do the second rise in a parchment lined bowl. Make sure the paper is larger than the bowl so you have" handles"to put the dough in the pot. The burn I got on my forearm 2years ago is still visible.But the bread is so good who cares?

- **Comment Body:** Great bread! One important tip I got from watching the video was how the flour was measured. He doesn't spoon the flour into the measuring cup and then level it off like you do for a cake - he scoops it. Makes for a denser cup of flour and this may help with the stickiness some folks have experienced with the dough.  A sprinkle of kosher salt or Montreal Seasoning on top of the loaf is a great addition.

I have on occasion grated raw garlic into the loaf with some grated cheese and sprinkled grated geese on the top with 5 min or so left in oven for a garlic cheese bread. Guilty. Yummy.

- **Comment Body:** I find the dough manipulations and long wait times unnecessary. I mix four cups whole wheat with a generous two teaspoons instant yeast, two teaspoons salt and two teaspoons sugar. Then add two cups 130-degree water and thoroughly mix with a spatula. Cover with damp towel and allow to double -- about 90 minutes. Dump in a large loaf pan, wait about 20 minutes until rises above rim, then bake about 40 minutes at 400 degrees. Works great -- including with add-ins.

- **Comment Body:** "Instant" yeast can be added to dry ingredients.  If you use  "active dry" yeast (which is different) you have to activate it first, Take about a 1/4 cup of the water from the recipe, heat it to about 110 degrees, and *twice* the amt of yeast (1/2 tsp) and a tsp of sugar.  Wait for a few minutes--it if foams and bubbles, it's active and you can then add it along with the water to the flour.

- **Comment Body:** This recipe is a staple in my kitchen.  I no longer have to pay $5 for a loaf of crunchy crusty bread from the market.  I have accumulated several types of flour (almond, rye, barley, whole wheat, oat) to change the taste to what sounds good with the dish I'm preparing. 1/2 C Oatmeal added instead of 1/2 C flour makes the bread very moist.  Just make sure you don't substitute more than 1/2 C of a nongluton flour.  Even if you have never made bread, this is easy and always successful.

- **Comment Body:** My friend made the bread here. I'm a flour dipper and she's a spooner. The difference in dough was dramatic. She had a much wetter dough that was much stickier and baked a flatter loaf. Still tasted great, but I'm going to weigh flour from now on. I'm told Jim Lahey specifies 15.25 oz.Question: My dough sticks to the towel. Tried parchment paper. Still a mess. If I spray a little oil in the bowl, etc., will I still get good crust, good crumb, etc.?

I keep a 1 quart open container of tap water on a table in order to allow the chlorine/other chemicals to dissipate and only use this water for my bread.

- **Comment Body:** I use 400 g flour to 300 g water, and 1.5 t salt, rather than volumetric measurements. I long since ditched the farina/polenta and towels in favor of flour and the fermenting bowl inverted over the dough—much simpler and less laundry, the bane of Lahey's original recipe. I bake in black iron at 450°F, 30 min covered, 10-15 uncovered, depending what color I want that day. For a smaller loaf, 320 g flour to 240 g water and 1 t salt. Use sourdough starter instead of yeast, if you have it.

For me, kneading is the fun part! I have made traditional dough for bread and pizza and kept it in the fridge for a few days--it's much easier to handle, and it tastes great. You just shape the dough when cold and allow it to rise at room temp for a couple hours.

- **Comment Body:** For the sourdough conversion - substitute about 1/4 cup active* starter for the dry yeast. I like to put it in the water measuring cup and stir it up, so that it spreads well into the loaf. Everything else is the same. LOTS more flavor.*active starter can be a starter that was fed (mixed with 2:1 flour:water) 12 hours after coming out of the fridge. I've had success with pulling healthy starter right out of the fridge and mixing it in warm water.

May I suggest trying again, ensuring you've mixed it well from the outset, checking that your yeast isn't past date, and that you use a cast iron 5 or 6 quart dutch oven (Lodge, Creuset whatever) We've had less success with  other types of cooking vessels.

Today I made it but instead of putting it for a second rise in cloth I put it in an oiled bowl. Then I put it in the Dutch oven for 20 minutes with the lid on and then another 20 with the lid off and a pie plate on the rack below with 8 ice cubes in it. Much lighter and easy to cut but still crispy crust. I also added a  heaping tablespoon each of rosemary and lemon zest

The dough was runny as I tried to fold it so I gradually added flour (as much as 1 C) just to hold it together. Instead of using a towel, I very lightly oiled a bowl and covered with a towel. It slid nicely into the Dutch oven, baked beautifully and tasted great (but not better). Incredibly forgiving recipe! (Which I'll follow minus the towel.)

What happens between the time he empties the stringy dough from the tub and the time he starts to do the four folds? You can't make four folds like that from the original dough. You have to use a ton of flour to keep the dough dry and malleable.   C'mon, Mark and Jim, you could have been a little more helpful about the transition between the stringy blob and the four folds.

I replace a half cup or so of white flour with wholemeal for a nuttier flavor, and sprinkle nigella or sesame seeds on the top. The only adjustments I have made is to heat oven to 425F, this helps to stop the base from getting too hard, and I let the dough rise for about 20 minutes, rather than the two hours to save time. I don't bother with the towels. Still a delicious result.

Instead, I take a silicon spatula and with it turn the dough around in the bowl about 8 times, lifting the dough from the sides and turning it over itself. The dough will be elastic but will lose the bubbles for the time being. Then leave it to rise for those final 2 hours. At baking time, pour out of the bowl into the hot baking dish.

I found the key trick to reducing the yeast is to ensure the moisture isn't lost (this allows the oven rise to come from steam and really lightens the loaf). I cover the bowel for the initial rise with wrap and add a rubber band to keep the seal. I line my Dutch oven lid with foil and make sure it's well sealed.

I also don't have a dutch oven, so I cooked it in a regular stainless steel pot with foil on top. It still turned out wonderfully and I couldn't be happier! There are a lot of positive comments here, but I wanted to assure other anxiety ridden novices that it'll be great!

- **Comment Body:** Hi Al, it's possible your dutch-oven lid is too loose and is letting out too much steam. Put heavy-duty or double-layer tin foil over the pot and jam the lid down over it. Push the exposed foil against the sides of the pot. That will seal in the steam better. The other problem, if you have a very chewy thin crust, is that your oven might be too cool. I don't think this is the problem, though, because your crust is dark brown. Try the tin foil first. If that fails, test the temp.

- **Comment Body:** Great recipe! I was having a problem with it turning out more dense than I like. If you increase the yeast to a teaspoon active dry yeast, then just let it sit and rise for a full day without handling it at all you get a much fluffier loaf. Just transfer it from the bowl to parchment paper to shape it into a loaf half a 1/2 hr before baking and lower the whole thing into the Dutch oven. Much less mess and handling, no extra flour added to prevent sticking, and more yeast so it's fluffy.

- **Comment Body:** Pyrex should go into a preheated oven, not one warming up. Some ovens use the broiler to achieve the desired temperature, and that direct heat can be too much for Pyrex sometimes. Heat the oven, stick the Pyrex in to come up to temp. 5 extra mins could prevent a nasty cleanup!

- **Comment Body:** Watched the video and followed recipe. I found the dough to be sticky to the point of being unmanageable. Watched Jim Lahey fold the dough and then form a ball, but this was near impossible. Had to add a 1/2 cup more flour and still very sticky. Have experience with wet doughs (ciabatta, baguette, etc.) but this was different. I ended up flopping it on the floured towel and baked in a cast iron combo cooker. Crumb tasty but a bit dense, and crust good. Also, video says 500 vs. 450 in recipe?

- **Comment Body:** Your yeast probably has gone bad. Next time, make sure your yeast is still alive by proofing your yeast: Just put some yeast and a little sugar in a glass of water and wait about 20 minutes. The water should start to foam -- that'll prove your yeast is alive and well. It's a bummer to have this happen; I hope you have better luck in the future.

- **Comment Body:** This makes amazing pizza dough!  If you want it "finished" faster, just add more yeast and leave in a warm place, I put mine next to our wood stove in winter and it rises within the hour, less flavor, but works great!  If the dough is too wet to work with, just add more flour until it doesn't stick, then press out your pizza crust.  The best thing about this bread recipe is how forgiving it is, even if it looks like junk, cook it, you won't be disappointed with the results.

- **Comment Body:** The only flour left on the shelf was All-Purpose, Pre-Sifted, Bleached Wheat Flour so I added an additional 12g of water. It may just have been my environment, but this worked perfectly. I did the final rise in a Brotform to get the great lines. The flavor & texture are really nice. My husband walked in from his 12-hour shift at the hospital to the smell of fresh baked bread. He ate half of it before falling asleep. That is everything right now. Thank you for sharing your recipe, Mr. Bittman.

It turned out fine! 2) I definitely could have upped the salt to 10g or more! 3) I let one rise for 12 hours and 17 for the second batch. I did not see a difference. 4) Baked mine in 4qt Dutch oven for 30 mins covered and 25 minutes uncovered. Came out perfect!

I also sprout whole wheat berries a week ahead of time (they sprout readily in the refrigerator, after a day's soaking and then drained and covered). I chop the sprouted wheat berries and add to the dough before the second rise. Never a failed loaf. I also double the recipe and use a 5-quart Dutch oven.

To bake, remove from freezer, place dough in oiled pan, cover with plastic wrap and allow to defrost & rise at room temperature for 3-4 hours until doubled. In YK: Room is warm, decrease initial rise time. Air is dry, coat with oil and saran, not towels.

I tried lining the lid with foil to make a tighter seal and WOW! What a difference! Same great flavor but the rise was much better, and the crust was even better. Even though the lid was quite tight before, there must have been just enough moisture leakage to cause a problem. If your crust is not shattering and the rise is low try lining your lid

Most breads are somewhere around 60-70%.  I didn't do the math until I made a gloopy, unmanageable mess.

If you follow the recipe, you'll end up with a batter that you definitely don't want poured into a "lightly floured towel"! You certainly won't be folding and tossing the dough as seen in the video; it will be impossible to even pick up.  Instead, follow the mixing instructions, but when he says "lightly flour a work surface", use a 1/2 cup; when he says "sprinkle more flour" another 1/4 cup, etc.

- **Comment Body:** Instant" yeast can be added to dry ingredients. If you use "active dry" yeast (which is different) you have to activate it first, Take about a 1/4 cup of the water from the recipe, heat it to about 110 degrees, and *twice* the amt of yeast (1/2 tsp) and a tsp of sugar. Wait for a few minutes--it if foams and bubbles, it's active and you can then add it along with the water to the flour.

- **Comment Body:** I've made this for years now and am thrilled with the results. I no longer measure any of ingredients. If I want a faster rise, then I add a little more yeast. In hot weather, it rises faster and the same amount of water can lead to a soupier dough. Adding the right amount of water is key and I do it by feel. I cut it with a dough knife, stretch it into baguettes and cook it in a turkey roaster. You can burn your hands with steam when you take the cover off, so be careful about that.

It is very easy to flop the dough from the frying pan, with one hand, onto your other hand then into the blazing hot pot.  No laundering towels.

After 18 hours, it had tripled in volume. It has a very faint (almost none) sourdough taste. It is wonderfully springy inside and chewy, not heavy or dense at all. Just the right size holes!

- **Comment Body:** I saw Jim Lahey make this bread on a TV show using 400g flour, 300g water and 8g salt. I stick with 1/4 tsp yeast, not the 1/8 he used.  These proportions (75% hydration) gives a less sticky, more manageable dough than the original recipe (80%) - maybe start off at 75% if you're new to this method.  Thanks to all who suggested ditching the towel and using the same bowl for the second rise; so much easier!  I use a 3.5qt oval cast iron pot which works perfectly and gives a high loaf.

- **Comment Body:** This is an excellent method but the proportions don't seem correct. I use 400g bread flour and 320g water (80% hydration), 8g salt and 1/4 tsp instant yeast. This produces a great crust and an open crumb very much like a traditional pane pugliese. In addition, I find that a smaller dutch oven contains the spread better and results in more oven spring. I use a LaCreuset No. 22 round pot which I think is only rated at 3.5 or 4 qts. I score the top with 4 scissor cuts in a square pattern.

I just dumped the loaf from my towel into the pot no problem, and the seeds are delicious with this loaf. The crust is divine. Yum!

- **Comment Body:** Bringing the water down from 1 5/8 (recipe suggestion) to 1 1/2 cups (video suggestion) was key for the dough to not be so sticky and hard to scrape off the towel or parchment.  I also switched to parchment paper as the dough stuck to the towel no matter how much additional flour I used. Easier to clean up using parchment too.  Lastly I sprinkled some kosher salt on the top before putting it in the oven.

I used bread flour, salt, active dry yeast in the water, and a quarter tsp of sugar as suggested by another reviewer.  Also, cornmeal as I had no wheat bran. I had solid rise and bubbles when I checked on it the next day, probably about 22 hours later.  The dough was a little tricky to work with, but it came out beautifully.  I can see doing this at least once a week if not more often.  Thx NYT

- **Comment Body:** Yes, an 18 hour rise will make a more flavorful bread.  You're only using   1/4 teaspoon of instant (quick rise) yeast so a long rise time won't be an issue. A good substitute for a Dutch oven is to put one loaf pan upside down over the loaf pan containing bread dough and hold them together with metal binder clips.  You'll get the same effect as you would with a Dutch oven.  I learned this from artisanbreadwithstev on YouTube.  He has loads of tips for making no knead bread.  Worth a look!

- **Comment Body:** The origin of the word “bread,” should you trust the centuries-old game of phonic “telephone” known as etymology, stems from the phrase, “broken pieces.”   This makes sense, as bread is old—one of the oldest things there is—meant to torn and chewed and prayed upon and preyed upon and celebrated and shared and also fed to ducks.   As I write, I hear the little ones on the block playing outside. With their stumpy ends of colored chalk, they paint a mosaic inspired by the cracks in the concrete.

- **Comment Body:** I have baked this bread at least once a week for 15 years.  Sometimes I do variations that turn it into cinnamon/raisin/walnut bread for breakfast toast or cranberry/orange/pecan.  Mostly, though, I bake the basic loaf.  I use cornmeal on a Silpat for raising the shaped loaf.  Extremely easy to turn it into the very hot pot.  I also heat oven to 475, bake 22 minutes, reduce heat to 425 and bake 11 minutes before uncovering for another 11 minutes.  Point is, ovens differ.  Do whatever works.

- **Comment Body:** I like to take this recipe to the final proof stage then I split it into 4 portions which I keep in lightly olive oiled glass jars in the fridge. It keeps for at least a couple of weeks. Then I take a portion and roll it out over a lightly floured counter and when it's quite thin I fold it back on itself and roll it a couple more times. Then I throw it on a hot gas grill and make the most delightful flat breads! Folding the dough traps air and the flatbread expands like a small football.

Sometimes i do a 1.5 x of the recipe (4.5 cups of flour, 2.25 cups water etc)  and bake it in my 3.5 qt and I think the size / shape is even better that way.   Good luck!

Preheat your Dutch oven in your regular oven for a full 1/2 hour then drop the parchment and dough into the Dutch oven to cook, covered for 20-25 mins, then uncovered until golden brown.  Loaf will come right off the parchment when done with no mess.

It doesn’t really need the sugar but I get better texture with it. When I use part whole wheat flour I seem to need a little extra water which I add a little at a time until I can incorporate all the dry flour. Since trying this recipe I haven’t brought bread!

- **Comment Body:** Some bakers have mentioned that parchment paper is only rated to 425 degrees. I found the solution to that on another baking site that taught me how to bake sourdough bread. I set the oven to 515 degrees and only bake with the parchment paper in the Dutch Oven for 18 minutes. By then the loaf has risen and is browned lightly. I remove the loaf from the dutch oven and bake the loaf for another 20 minutes directly on the middle rack. Also solved for me burnt loaf bottoms by baking on the rack.

After that initial rise, shape the dough and put it directly in the Dutch oven lined with parchment.  Let it rise the same two hours, put on the lid and place in a cold oven.  As soon as the oven gets up to temperature, bake for 30 minutes covered, and another 25 minutes uncovered.

The crust is always fabulous the first day. If I have leftover bread, I toast it until it's gone (never more than two days). I've changed it up--it's very forgiving. But I gave up on the towel years ago. Too much mess with such a fragile dough. A long length of parchment is best.

Dusting of flour doesn't help much, when I put in the oven it's still sticky and spread out and can't slash the top. ??

The way I made this: I put the flour from the King Arthur bag in a bowl first and scooped with a spoon into the measuring cup and then into the mixing bowl. This will keep the measurement more accurate than dipping the measuring cup into the bag.  Used the listed 1/4 tsp.yeast, 1 1/4 tsp.salt and 1 5/8 cup cool tap water.  Used an All Clad 4qt covered saucepan with a round of parchment in the bottom.

- **Comment Body:** In my previous (and first) attempt at bread making I used Bittman’s faster recipe, with hot water, a dash of vinegar and a 4-hour proof - and I will never use that one again. While the crust on that one was perfect, the inside was dense and way too doughy. This recipe, however, gave a perfect loaf inside & out. I didn’t have any problems with sticking to the pan. I’m pretty generous with my cornmeal for the second proofing and I used the Emile Henry bread pot, which I would highly recommend.

- **Comment Body:** It sounds to me as though the dough needed to rise a bit longer before you baked it. You should also check your oven temperature. Finally, all baking times on bread are approximate. To be sure it's done, insert an instant-reader thermometer into the center of the baked loaf (from the bottom is best). You're looking for a temperature of 190 degrees F.

- **Comment Body:** I would not recommend using your hands for this recipe. Combine using a mixer, a fork or other utensil. It really doesn't matter since the long fermentation process is supposed to do the kneading for you. The dough is wet and shaggy, which makes for messy hands. You won't be kneading with your hands at all for this recipe. The whole idea is to use time to develop the gluten instead of kneading by hand or with a mixer.

- **Comment Body:** I’ve found using a cold oven with the oven light on provides a good proofing environment. We set our house thermostat for 58 deg F at night so "room temp" is not satisfactory. Use a digital thermometer to check the temperature of the light warmed oven. If still too cool, try a higher wattage bulb.   Cheers!

- **Comment Body:** I have made this many times — sometimes with my daughter (aged 4 till now 6).  I find it a forgiving recipe. I scoop ingredients with a cup, I’ve never weighed. I dump dough onto parchment, fold it 2-3x. Sometimes i dice up some sharp cheddar and put it in the dough at this point. I don’t usually do second ride more than 15mins. Lift paper into Dutch oven and bake.  The bread rises as it bakes.

- **Comment Body:** it should not be a problem! My house is always cold. I'd suggest placing the dough by the warmest place in the kitchen if you know where it is. I often store it in my unheated oven overnight and it does the trick.  No need to do the second rise if you if it's been over 18hrs. The dough will transfer from the bowl to a lightly floured piece of parchment paper, then to the Dutch oven without much trouble.

- **Comment Body:** This recipe seems to turn out no matter what I do to it.  Before I go to bed, I mix it up and leave covered overnight. 8-10 hours later I put my Dutch oven into the oven to preheat and pull the dough over itself, four sides. Once the oven is preheated - about 20 minutes, I ‘pour’ the dough into the hot pot, sprinkle some roasted sesame seeds on top, and bake as directed. One bowl, no extra flour, towels, parchment, or rise time.  Cut so many corners, but it’s perfectly delicious every time!

- **Comment Body:** I mistakenly used 1/4 tsp of active dry yeast instead of instant yeast the first time making this a few days ago, and it still came out wonderfully! When I realized the mistake, I looked up the conversion, and you should technically use 1.25x the amount of active dry yeast if substituting for instant yeast. So in this case, it would be 5/16 of a tsp of active dry yeast instead of 1/4 tsp instant yeast. I just use a heaping 1/4 tsp. Works fine for me. I've made 3 loaves so far.

- **Comment Body:** I did this and after a couple of failed attempts, it finally turned out amazing. Success came after playing around with the amounts. In Italy we don’t use volumetric measurements, so I was looking at the converted grams quantities for the solid ingredients and unawarely using UK cups rather than US cups for the water – I didn’t know there were two different systems! So the dough was too liquid. In the end this is what made the trick: 550g flour; a 7g sachet instant yeast; 10g salt; 410g water.

If you’re just starting out making bread it can be hard to recognize a good working consistency for the dough. In this one I think it’s better to gradually add the water until all the flour is moistened & the consistency seems right. You may not need every drop of water called for in the recipe. It should be sticky not runny.

- **Comment Body:** For parchment fans: Coat parchment with seeds roughly the shape of your dough ball. I often use a combo of fennel, poppy and sesame seeds. Second rise the bread seam side down on the parchment. Flip into the hot pan and finish as usual. You get a lovely seeded loaf where the seeds stick well and give extra aroma to the bread.

I have now made with AP flour & bread; both King Arthur. The bread flour on today's loaf was by far the best version to date. Also added some chopped fresh rosemary to the parchment when placing dough seam side down before step 3. Crust is crunchy though loaf is much softer than AP batches prior. This recipe has given me so much confidence in baking!

Set the instapot on the yogurt setting for at least 6 hours.  I do this before going to sleep. In the morning I take my bath and have breakfast then finish the other steps. However long you want dough to rise you can use the instapot method and cut your time in half.

- **Comment Body:** This recipe is excellent. For the newbie bread baker a little troubleshooting: -Only have active dry yeast instead of instant? Stir yeast in 1/2 of the warm water along with a 1/4 tsp of sugar. After 5-10 mins it will have bubbles on the top. Add the yeast water & remaining water to the dry ingredients.   -Don’t have an oven-safe pot with a lid? This recipe works fine w/ a floured baking sheet- just plop the bread on. Score & put another sheet w/ water in it under in oven for a crisp crust.

So now I do the 2nd rise with dough sitting on a thin flexible plastic cutting board having learned that I must use a rubber scraper to get the "loaf" into the baking pan.Even when the loaf bakes up somewhat flat the flavor has still been good. I just say it is Ciabatta bread.

I agree with everyone that says skip the towel and go straight to parchment the second day, and then back to the router.  It definitely needs more yeast than the original recipe as well, and I like more salt than given here as well.

My dough did not look sticky after mixing, so I threw in about a 1/4 cup of Prosecco (I was drinking the dregs of it anyway...) and tossed the dough around. Baked with a coarse-ground cornmeal/flour dusting, a Le Creuset Dutch oven, and parchment paper. This bread could change your life.

I was pleasently surprised how easy it is to make quality bread. The one imperfection, though, is that the bottom is a little burnt--not too much to make it inedible, just slightly. I cooked it at 450, preheated the Dutch oven for exactly 30 min. Any solutions? Little bit of oil on the bottom of the pot before throwing the dough in?

Place the damp towel on the bread rack you’ll place the bread on. Remove baked bread from the oven and place it on the damp towel - then entirely wrap the bread with the rest of the damp towel.  This method will not create a soggy bread; it will create a softer, more tender crust.  Leave in place as bread cools down and then remove.

- **Comment Body:** I make many variants, including rye. I use 1 c rye to 2 c flour, and add ground caraway seeds. My own preference for ALL of the breads is to use the COOKS ILLUSTRATED variant. Add 1 T vinegar (I use cider) and replace some water with cheap beer. I use about 4-5 T beer. The vinegar and beer up the yeasty flavor. To create more of a pumpernickel, use 1/3 rye, 1/3 white whole wheat, and 1/3 white. Add 2 T cocoa powder. Add 1 T molasses to the water. Add ground caraway seeds.  Try coffee for water!

- **Comment Body:** Used out of date bread flour (2017) and opened up new instant dry yeast May 2014.  We keep our house cool 65/66 degrees so I allowed for extra time to rise (20+) first rise.  Chickened out on second rise (a little over 3 hours) ... good loaf of bread!  Very pleased.  For second rise used parchment paper inside bowl before putting into aprox. size of Very Heavy cast iron/enamel oval pot.  Be bold.  If I got a good loaf, you can too.

I watched some videos on line which recommended that you (1) use hot water - which also reduced rise time - and (2) let the dough rise the second time in a parchment lined bowl, transferring the whole blob at once in to the dutch oven. This is where I went wrong. I disrupted the surface when I transferred to dutch oven.

- **Comment Body:** I never have trouble with this. I would suggest be careful not to overwork the dough during the ball making process. That tiny bit of yeast has already worked very hard by the time you shape the loaf. Also, maybe shape the loaf a couple of hours earlier so the yeast still has a little ‘umf’ left in it to rise again.

Preheat 3.5qt dutch oven at 450. Roll dough over in oil, plop dough in dutch oven. Reduce heat to 425. Cook 30 mins. Uncover, cook 20 more. Great texture, awesome crust.

- **Comment Body:** Works like a charm.  I've since doubled the recipe to fit my cast iron Dutch oven.  There are some minor tweaks to this recipe that you can find by googling:  1. Increase the salt slightly for more flavor. 2. Decrease the yeast slightly and the bread will rise more. 3. Add 1/4 - 1/2 cup of whole-wheat or rye flour for more flavor. 4. Use the "stretch and fold" method four times during the rise . This method only takes about 30 seconds to perform.  But then it's no longer the original recipe...

- **Comment Body:** 1. Is the yeast alive? Put some in warm water. If it's foamy, it's alive.  2. After the 18hr ferment, are there bubbles? If not, the yeast is probably dead or not feeding.   3. How is the dough after 2hr proof? If it didn't expand, the yeast is probably dead or it's underproofed. Try moving it to a warmer room or proof with the oven light on. If it's more than 2x it's overproofed and will collapse when baked. Be gentle handling the dough or you'll knock the CO2 out and it won't rise.

Yeast particles are now smaller than they used to be and don't need to be dissolved. You also don't need to proof it by adding it to sugar and water unless you have expired or old yeast and you want to test it and 'prove' that it is still active and ok to use.  https://www.kingarthurflour.com/blog/2015/09/25/active-dry-yeast

I also made sure all the water I used was warm. I don’t know if it made a huge difference overall, but it made it easier to mix. The bread was PERFECT.

- **Comment Body:** I’ve made this twice now and end up not with a ball of dough, but with a sticky, unmanageable blob.  The recipe says 1-5/8 cups of water, while the video says 1.5.  The dough is so difficult to work with that amounts are lost to the work surface, my hands and a spatula, no matter how much flour I use.  I think I will abandon ship here and use a regular bread recipe whose outcome actually matches the description.  The normal kneading is a much better alternative to this sticky mess.

It is a bit of a miraculous recipe, in that no matter how ugly, tight, loose, etc. the dough looks going into the dutch oven, it comes out as delicious and nice-looking bread every time. If you are so put off by the look of it after the second rise that you have never actually baked it, I would say try it and see what you get!

I get soup when I use these measures, and know that many folks find even 80% doughs challenging.  (Or is the key, as another commenter mentioned, that he scoops the flour, which may pack more weight into each cup?)   I'd sure prefer it if NYT bread recipes specified by weight.  Results in much more repeatable results.

I no longer measure the flour and water for my starter--I just throw my estimates of equal amounts into my jar and stir. I  use 1/4 c of starter in the recipe. For what it's worth, my starter is made with organic whole wheat flour. I bake this bread about 1x per week on average. The Tartine loaf is also delicious but I'm lazy, lol.

As Jim suggested in his book "My Bread" I purchased a Lodge preseasoned 5 quart cast iron pot from Amazon. The lid doubles as a pan!! Great purchase. Can't wait to try his other recipes.

I am baking two or three loaves of this per week. I have tried different flour combinations and it is consistently terrific. The texture is terrific, the flavor is terrific and it is so easy to do, just wanted to say thank you for sharing. LOVE,  LOVE, and  LOVE

- **Comment Body:** If you like white spelt flour, you may have noticed it does not behave as well as white wheat flour. The gluten is more fragile, it does not respond as readily to yeast, and the loaf has a tendency to dry out the next day. I substitute 1/4 cup applesauce for 1/4 c water and use 1/2 teaspoon yeast. The fibre in the applesauce helps retain moisture in the final loaf. The extra yeast helps with the rise. It makes an excellent bread.

I scrunch the top half of the foil pan out into kind of a round shape, then line it with a round piece of parchment paper. Pour in the dough using rubber spatula to get every last bit. Score the top with a wet sharp knife, then set the foil pan into the very hot Dutch oven, cover & bake as per the recipe. To be cont.

I used 1 cup "old fashioned" oats (2 generous cups all purpose flour, 1 5/8 c water and a generous 1/4 t fast rising yeast). I also used the oats to prevent sticking during handling on the counter and during the rise (in a towel), so there are oats folded inside. Best version yet, having tried wheat flour, corn flour or corn meal instead of oat. The oats that are folded inside can be seen and add a bit of texture. Phenomenal!

- **Comment Body:** Only done this recipe twice now, with different steps, and it's come out perfect both times. 1st time I wasn't able to wait 18 hrs, so I waited more like 22 hrs before performing step 2, which requires you to wait another 2 hrs before the dough doubles in size. The bread did not grow in size at all, and the dough was not firm to the touch, which worried me. But I threw it in the Le Creuset anyway and it came out perfect. 2nd time I made it I skipped step 2 with the same perfect result.

IF you have trouble with this, it may be that your yeast is dead (been there, done that - package should have a date); house is too cold; or you didn't wait long enough for the dough to rise.  I've made this from memory a few times and forgetten the 2nd rise. It works, but not as well.  Also, don't focus on exact measurements;  getting the right consistency seems more important

Abandoned the towel idea--makes a mess. Now clean and oil the mixing bowl during the rest and use that for the 2-hour rise, as others have recommended. I store the bran in a drink bottle and shake some into the hot Dutch oven and over the dough. The long rise can be up,to 24 hours--I flex it so the bread is still warm when first served.

- **Comment Body:** I’ve found that the easiest way to get consistent results when baking / bread making is to weigh the ingredients.   Also keep consistent ingredients on hand..Not all “all-purpose” flours are created equally. I personally use King Arthur Bread Flour for this recipe, not that it’s better than another, but it’s given me good results so I stick with it.   I use the 1 1/2 cup measurement for water as shown in the video.

- **Comment Body:** Great, simple recipe. Can use a tablespoon of sourdough starter instead of the yeast. Some whole wheat flour is good. For the "second rise," I put the dough in a parchment-paper-lined bowl, let rise, and then put the dough with paper into the hot Dutch oven. It comes out looking a little ragged because of the paper, but there is no dusting of towels, cleaning the mess left by dusting the towels, hoping the dough does not stick to the towels, cleaning the towels, etc.

- **Comment Body:** I no longer go to the store for bread as this amazing recipe has changed bread making for me forever - it is so easy and so flavorful. Letting the dough rise super slowly really adds to the character of the bread. As to dough sticking to the bowl when it rises, I found a nonstick bread machine bucket in the back of a cupboard from the "bad old days" and have often used it to let the dough rise. No more sticking dough - just slide the dough out and get on with it.

- **Comment Body:** I have now made this bread twice, in a Staub 4-quart Dutch oven that I got on sale at Sur La Table.  The first time, I preheated the pot.  The loaf stuck quite a bit to the bottom but I eventually got it out.  Tonight I did not preheat the pot.  The loaf looks better than the last one — higher — but it is completely glued to the bottom of the pot.  Is this because of something I did or didn’t do, or should I have seasoned the pot first?  Being on sale, it came without box or instructions...

Since whole wheat flour requires more kneading I doubled the kneading specified in the recipe (see what I did there? :) ).  The cast iron Dutch oven works great, but it doesn't give you control over the shape of the loaf. Next time I'll try it in a glass bread mold.

Let it sit 15min so yeast wakes up smoothly b4 adding water. Also, add 1 tea spoon/organic brown sugar to lukewarm water *careful, water cannot be 2 hot or it kills the yeast*. Yeast needs food (sugar) to rev up her motor & rise. Then, mix warm water & flour. Once dough bowl is been covered with plastic/cloth, a hot water bowl placed under it will provide energy 2 rise ;)

- **Comment Body:** We love this recipe and, since discovering it, have basically stopped buying bread. Some notes: it works best with high-quality flour, and you will definitely see variation with flour types. King Arthur all-purpose flour seems to yield the best loaves for us (soft inside, bubbly, crust isn’t rock hard). Other types of flour will yield wildly different results even if all other factors hold constant. Allowing the dough to rise for something like 24 hours works best!

Massive thanks to those that suggested using parchment paper to lower the dough into the hot pan...this made it so much easier to transfer the dough into the pot.

- **Comment Body:** You don't really need to make any changes; your bread will just rise more slowly at a lower temperature. The upside is that a longer, slower rise will also develop more flavor— this is why bakers often allow their dough to rest in the refrigerator overnight before baking.  You may want to make your first loaf when you have time to keep track of its progress in your environment so you know what to expect the next time, and the next, and the next.

- **Comment Body:** Not a great idea to put the salt on the yeast, you're likely killing some of it. Also to develop even more flavor and character use a sourdough starter and give it 20 hrs instead of 12.

- **Comment Body:** Skillet with lid may work if the lid allows the loaf to rise during baking (there must be spare room at the top when you put the lid on.  Otherwise, maybe try putting the loaf in uncovered skillet, and stand a small bowl of water in the bottom of the oven to give it mositue during baking.  Let us know how it turns out!

- **Comment Body:** I have been making this bread for month and just love it.  In step 3 I add pumpkin seeds and sometimes caraway seeds. I put parchment paper over  a medium size bowl.  When the dough is dropped on the paper, it will drop into the bowl with the parchment paper corners sticking out. After the second rise I just grab the four corners and drop it into the heated pot and follow baking directions.  The parchment paper can take the heat and makes it much easier than the towel version.

Dough was impossibly sticky, it couldn’t be folded in on itself even why my hands were covered with flour (it looked like I was wearing gloves made of dough), I couldn’t form it into a ball, it looked nothing like the video, it didn’t rise on the oven like the pictures. But it was still *delicious*. Don’t toss the dough no matter how wonky; it will be delicious!

- **Comment Body:** I have baked a fair few loaves of bread, and enjoy baking greatly. That being said, I was having a serious off day when I made this one. I added too much water, creating a soupy blobby dough. I left it to proof too long in my proofing basket, which I thought would contain the blobby mess; it did not. It also stuck like bubblegum to said basket causing me to almost give up completely. I’m so glad I didn’t because even though I did everything wrong this bread still ended up being PERFECT!!! :D

I use these orig weights, which I wrote them on the bottom of the bowl I use for the dough for easy reference. My only failed attempt was when the yeast I had died due to being left in my kitchen cab over a hot summer. Now I keep a 1 lb bag of SAF yeast in the freezer :)

- **Comment Body:** I've made this 3 times now in quarantine; each time is easier + better. I have active yeast, which you just mix in w the measured water before pouring in the bowl w flour / salt. I doubled my recipe because my dutch oven is a bigger oval, which makes for a nicer shape (cooked the same amount of time in the oven). For the second rise, I poured the dough in a bowl lined with parchment. I used a spatula to fold it on itself a few times, then into the dutch oven. Super easy and no mess!

Second time, a month into quarantine, there was too much water and everything was all sticky- I hadn't weighed the water bc I was fighting with my boyfriend, polishing off a full bottle of wine, then forgot to check inside the cast iron dutch oven and ended up preheating it with my chef bf's (now melted) allclad immersion blender inside.  I would highly recommend making this in a good mood, with a food scale, less water... keep the wine for sanity

Followed the directions exactly.  4.5 qt Dutch oven was perfect.  I took off the plastic knob beforehand and stuffed the hole with Al foil. Used oat flour for the dusting part, it was great. No problem using towels to transfer. The crust was so crisp and delicious. Will possibly add rosemary, olives next time. Comments stating that recipe is forgiving helped!

The finished product was fine but I am puzzled about what happened in the process. Any thoughts?

First time I tried it I removed the knob on my older 5qt model and stuffed with foil as suggested by another. I have made the recipe 3 times now and the 2nd two times tried my smaller 3qt cuisinart enamel cast iron (with ceramic knob) and it fit and cooked perfectly (but needed a little less cooking time).

Brought out to rise at lunchtime on day 3, and let it rise all afternoon. In an oiled stainless steel bowl.  Dumped it in a very hot Dutch oven with 12 charcoal briquettes below and 20  on the lid.  Baked for about 35 minutes, and no top off bake.  It did not rise as much as at home but was still delicious, sitting on a river beach in a wilderness canyon!

- **Comment Body:** For those struggling with a "soupy" dough:  The intro above says that the recipe has been changed to reflect Mark Bittman's update in "No Kneading, But Some Fine Tuning" (see link in the intro).  But, Bittman's update calls for 345 grams of water...NOT the 390 grams specified here!  The dough using less water is still very sticky (a characteristic of no-knead breads) - but not the soupy mess I dealt with on my first two tries.  It's manageable and much more like the dough in the video.

- **Comment Body:** Make SURE that you are using "instant yeast" (also known as Rapid Rise) -- it will indicate so on the package.  "Active Dry" yeast will not deliver the same results, because you need to let the water and yeast (and often a bit of sugar) sit for a bit so the yeast becomes active before mixing it with the flour!

You can double this, split into two at the "folding" stage, and let rise in two separate bowls to make two loaves.  Also, it works great in the 4 qt Staub dutch oven, but I was skeptical that it would work in my 2.5 qt LC french oven because it looked too small--nope, perfect.  I made two loaves at the same time in these two pans and they came out exactly the same.  6 3/4 qt Dutch oven was wide and flat but still great.

- **Comment Body:** I don't see how this recipe as written could possibly work.  The water to flour ratio has to be off. 390 milliliters of water equals about 390 grams of water.  430 grams of flour mixed with 390 grams of water equals a hydration rate of 90%.  How can that possibly be workable? It's almost soup.  A better water to flour ratio would be 70%, or approximately 300 grams of water to 430 grams of flour.

- **Comment Body:** for those of you without a dutch oven, it is possible to make this bread in a stainless steel pot (as long as there are no components that cannot handle the high temps.) If you are using stainless steel, don't preheat the pot. Make sure to line it with parchment paper, and if you don't have an oven safe lid, you can use tightly wrapped tinfoil for the first part of the bake.

I put flour or cornmeal in the bottom of the bowl and do the second rise in the bowl. I often put a mixture of sesame seeds, sunflower seeds and pepitas in the bottom of the bowl too for a spectacular nutty top. I also make a version with one cup of whole wheat and the rest white flour. Great recipe!

- **Comment Body:** An alternate method that works just as well is this:  put the dough on parchment paper in the Dutch oven for that second rise.  When you’re ready, put the cover on and put the Dutch oven in the oven and set the temperature to 425.  When it gets to that temperature, set your timer for 30 minutes.  At the end of that time, take the lid off and bake another 20-25 minutes.  Remove from oven and using the parchment paper, carefully lift the bread out and put on a rack to cool.

- **Comment Body:** Whole wheat bread absorbs more liquid than unbleached. because I'm using half whole wheat I use 1 5/8 cup water (not 1 1/2 cup).  cover with a shower cap and let it sit overnight. I omit any added flour for the second rise; I just fold the dough over in the same pan as the first rise, rest it 15 minutes, line my colander in parchment paper (with no oiling, no sprinkling corn meal) and dump the dough in this for the second rise. Easily lifted into the heated lidded baking bowl.

After 55 minutes, the bread was already done. Internal temp was 200 degrees, so additional baking wasn't needed, with the lid off. Aside from the bottom sticking, the bread was perfect. Great crust, and crumb. Once I figure out the sticking problem, this really may be the way to go in the future. Thanks!

- **Comment Body:** I finally had some success. I increased the flour to 450 g, decreased the water to 1-1/2 c., and I put the dough into the refrigerator for an hour after the 18-hour rise and before turning it out. I used plenty of flour (about 1/2 c.) on the board and on top of the dough before each fold, and I folded the dough four or five times before forming it into a ball. The ball held its shape for the second rise and into the oven. The crumb had nice air pockets, if a bit on the chewy/moist side.

I cross hatch slice into the top of the dough and then sprinkle it with coarse kosher salt. Once you remove the lid and continue baking, it will take another 25-30 minutes (not 15).Best bread ever!!!Enjoy

- **Comment Body:** I've  found that using the absolutely least amount of water to hold the ball together works best.  Use slightly less water to start (just under 1.5 cups here in humid Houston works for me)  and wet your hands slightly as necessary while forming the ball until it picks up and holds all the crumbs.  Then I seal the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in the oven with the light on overnight.  This little extra heat accelerates the fermentation somewhat.  Good luck!

I use an old cast-iron stew pot; when I tried a wider one the bread naturally spread out more. And with plenty of corn meal there is never a problem of the bread sticking.One of the great things about this bread is the it doesn't get stale quickly.

- **User Display Name:** tundra
- **Comment Body:** The yeast isn't wrong. If you want to produce a loaf in just a few hours, you will want more yeast. The long ferment allows plenty of opportunity for the 1/4 tsp of yeast to do its work. If you're having problems it isn't from the yeast. Artisan doughs are typically wet. That can alarm bakers used to drier doughs. Wetter dough gives you a more open crumb. Also measuring by volume is less accurate than measuring by weight. You may be adding more water and less flour than you think.

- **Comment Body:** I think I can shed some light on why this recipe is hit or miss. If you use a heavy measuring cup and get a 140g scoop, you're looking at 90% hydration (the weight of the water is 90% of the flour's). If you use a lighter cup or 125g measures instead, you end up with a nearly unmanageable 102% hydration.I fell into the latter group and got a very nice chibatta at the end of my bake. I'm giving this another go at 80% hydration and 10g yeast like other recipes.

It has less gluten than wheat and Pentosins, which are a type of sugar complex that competes with Gluten for water and can make dough sticky or the finished bread gummy if it's aggressively mixed or kneaded.

- **Comment Body:** I omitted the yeast & substituted 4 oz of fed sourdough starter and reduced the water.  When I didn't get much action from this dough I added 2 oz more starter which resulted in a very active dough. The bread has a wonderful crust and texture. It even tastes good!

- **Comment Body:** It is one-quarter teaspoon. Seems counter-intuitive, but it works. I've been making a variation on this for years, passed on from an old friend, with that amount. Maybe the yeast you used was done for the time it didn't rise (or the conditions weren't right for the rising). But a quarter-teaspoon works just fine.

- **Comment Body:** "One and five-eighths cups? Can anybody claim to be able to measure that approximately, let alone accurately?"The superiority of the metric system is indisputable.  But for Americans, measuring 1 5/8 cups is trivially easy.  Because there are 8 fluid ounces in a cup, and every American measuring cup will have marks for 1 ounce, 2 ounces, 3 ... and 5 ounces.  So you simply measure one cup of water and pour it in.  Then you measure 5 ounces of water and pour it in.  Easy peasy!

You will have 98% of just baked bread anytime at your convenience with zero waste from stale, hard bread.  I live on this bread by topping a slice with any number of items such as: drizzled olive oil-garlic slices-anchovy-feta cheese- butter w/scrambled eggs-coffee-etc,.

Totally forgiving, but letting it proof for 25 hours might be over doing it.  I have let it go for 10 - 14 and never have had a problem.    I would suggest try it again.  And you need to use the "Rapid-rise" yeast, fast acting.  If you fail once, try again. It is so little work for such a great product.

Next time I'm using the recommended weights and scoring the top. The crust is very sturdy and difficult to cut, now have crust shrapnel all over kitchen.

- **Comment Body:** It could be the temperature of your kitchen rather than the yeast. Grocery store yeast may be more picky, but using a really warm environment may overcome the difference.  Yeast loves a very warm, moist environment.  If my kitchen is too cold, I'll preheat my oven, then turn it off and rise my dough in there.  I haven't tried this recipe though - just a general tip for yeast.

- **Comment Body:** I make no-knead Dutch oven boules almost every week using my 4-qt Le Creuset and the parchment paper sling method.  Never a problem with the bread not coming out beautifully circular.  I use BRM Artisan Bread Flour and subsitute 2T of plain kefir for some of the water.  Gives the bread a slight sour-dough tang which we love.

This has always provided a nice crisp for me with other recipies. Might need to leave lid off or bake longer. Its all about the steam!

You could try substituting partial almond flour, get a heavier more solid loaf no doubt. Also can almond flour tolerate the high temperatures

- **Comment Body:** I have tried this recipe 4 times already, and I always get a flat bread. The first rise seems to go well, but the second stays almost the same size.. I tried using parchment paper too.. One step that I seem to have a problem with, is shaping the dough into a ball. It seems everytime I try to shape it, the inside of it thats not floured sticks to everything and makes it a lot harder. Could this be the problem?

- **Comment Body:** Hi Aviva,  You can't just switch out whole wheat flour for white flour in this recipe. Wheat flour recipes have different proportions of sugar, yeast, etc. In fact, whole wheat recipes are often a blend of white and whole wheat flours. I suggest you check out King Arthur website w/their many recipes and reviews, and also Artisan Bread in 5 Minutes a Day. Good luck!

Question: I used a Danks 6 qt Dutch oven (purchased long before we learned more about Mario himself). When I preheated the pan dark streaks appeared all over the outside of the pan. I just spent a long time scrubbing it and am planning to order a Loge cast iron oven. Has anyone else had issues with pre-heating the Dutch oven?

Those little pockets are just waiting for some wonderful marinara to sop up. I just added 1 teaspoon of sea salt and it isn’t enough will add more next time. Reading the various reviews, I will add kalamata olives next time for some added taste/textures. Baked in cast iron pot, removed lid after 30 minutes and it looked great, but stuck back in oven for additional browning.

- **Comment Body:** This recipe has changed my bread life.  Every time it comes out of the oven, I can't believe that I made it.  Like a lot of others, I do the final rise in a bowl with a little olive oil and then just flip it into my heated Le Creuset.  I have played around with beer, different flours, different wait times, etc.  My favorite, so far, is a little beer, 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 bread flour and an 18 hr. first rise. Next up will be herbs!  THANK YOU!!

I've played with all kinds of flour combinations, even throwing in some white all purpose flour with a chalk-like consistency that I found at the back of a cupboard and the bread always turns out. If you get to the end of a day and realize you've forgotten to bake bread that's been sitting for over 24 hours (whoops), it happily goes in the fridge for a slow-rise.

And, I cut the salt ... normally to nothing. That said, if I'm making my "pesto bread," it's getting sodium in general, and some salt, from the parmesan.  Other "twist" is that, with the larger loaf, since I'm going to have a longer cooking time, I usually start tapering the temperature after 10 minutes. I don't get precise, but I usually cut the oven temperatur

- **Comment Body:** The herbs can be mixed into the dough, and the olive oil can be brushed on side that will be top before adding to pan. I would eliminate the bran or cornmeal on top if doing his. For the Gruyere, it seems it would be best added when you take dough out of container and lay out right before folding. Put in Gruyere, then fold. I like to add sesame seeds, or poppy or flaky salt, etc. on occasion. I find done best if I eliminate bran then oil top with oil of choice or melted butter, then add topping.

- **Comment Body:** It is okay to flour sticky dough to fold and shape.  I would also recommend parchment instead of towels.  It's easier to handle and can even be lifted and placed directly in pan with parchment.  Parchment will not burn and helps it just turn out of the pot onto cooling rack.  I use it because I don't want to use bran or cornmeal.

- **Comment Body:** Variations: For seeded bread thickly scatter seeds of choice–i.e. fennel, poppyseed and sesame–on parchment rather than a towel for the second rise. Parchment helps the seeds adhere and I find it easier to flip. For a cheese-y loaf scatter in about a cup of shredded cheddar divided in at least three fold-overs. Rise on parchment and lower it into the hot baker. Brush with olive oil and more shreds. Works best with dry aged cheddar. Fabulous toasted!

I also make a variation using half whole wheat and half all purpose flours, and then add coarsely chopped walnuts and rosemary.  The rosemary, walnut version is also delicious and almost always eaten with butter as soon as it comes out of the oven. I did find adding some extra cornmeal to the hot pot before adding the dough helps the bread release more easily.

- **Comment Body:** Did you heat the pan for a full 30 minutes before putting the dough in? The high heat should repel the dough. If your Le Creuset is an older version with an exposed iron bottom it might help to put a reflective pan under the pot on a lower shelf to prevent burning. I use an aluminum pie pan for this when I use my older baker.

- **Comment Body:** Made as is-so easy! The video helps too.  When I took the lid off to bake the last ~15 mins, it was already brown so I baked only 5 more mins to prevent burning. Unlike the recipe, the video says 500 degrees, which meant ~450-475 for my oven according to my oven thermometer, which worked out.  I didn't backwards plan the resting time-so the dough went in the oven ~11pm. Next time, I'll plan better to eat fresh while the crust is crunchy & perfect. It took 18+ hours to get the bubbles (not 12).

I got a great oven spring regardless and the texture was so moist and chewy - phenomenal. This was my first attempt at baking a boule and I am so excited to refine this to taste and make more! The bottom was a bit too dense but the outer crust was perfectly crispy after the 20ish minutes in the oven with the lid off.

Once it was ready for the oven I inverted the bowl and it fell into the pot no problem.  I also used the smaller 3 1/2 quart Le Creuset Dutch oven.

High altitudes usually make things rise super quick, but the low amount of yeast keeps it under control. I'm at 5000 ft and usually slow a rise down by putting the dough in the fridge overnight. But this recipe, I wouldn't worry about that.

Yes it takes a total of about 18 hours but no real work is required. The result is a beautiful boule

### Recipe: No-Knead Bread

- **Comment Body:** Finished this bread about an hour ago, and it looks and tastes amazing.....  The bad:  the dough is always super tacky and sticks like glue to bowl, towels, everything.    Also, try not making huge mess when you (try to)  take the bread off towel and plop it in pot to bake.  Even though I used flour snd cornmeal liberally on top of dough the (non-terrycloth) dough was stuck to towel and lost a lot of it that couldn’t be unstuck.  Flour and cornmeal everywhere.  Little effort, tons of cleanup!

- **Comment Body:** It sounds like it didn't rise at all, so that means your yeast is dead (or you forgot it). It, um, shouldn't be batter consistency even if the yeast is dead so I suspect you also added too much water by mistake.

- **Comment Body:** I royally screwed up somehow- had very soupy and sticky (think thick pancake batter) after 12 hours of resting. I added flour to the dough and kept adding until I got my consistency and then kept on with the directions (laid it between to towels well floured). It was not perfect and there were multiple "seams" but by the time it came out of the oven it had redeemed itself and risen into a beautiful loaf. It brought SO much quarantine joy. Highly recommend esp. for the amateur bread maker!!

- **Comment Body:** Hi Josh, you can just cover it with foil.  Because baking is a dry heat cooking method, coverings are used to prevent large baked items from scorching the food's outside while the inside still cooks.  Whatever you're baking, a thick loaf of bread or a turkey, bear in mind that each cooking experience will vary, so keep an eye on your babies so that they emerge from the oven with the crispy, browned crust or skin you desire.  You'll emerge from isolation a skilled home chef!  Hope this helps!

I flipped the loaf into the hot dutch oven and quickly scored it. I baked it as advised - covered for 30 minutes, uncovered for 15. I put foil on the knob, no explosions. I had no issues with sticking (use more flour than you think you need on the *cotton* towel!). This is the most beautiful loaf of bread I've ever baked, I can't wait to eat it.

The only adaptations I made were: 1) using active dry yeast instead of instant yeast; 2) putting the dough back into the bowl rather than between cotton towels; and 3) using aluminum foil instead of plastic wrap for covering. I've let it rest in step 1 anywhere from 12-18 hours, and it's come out beautifully every time.

- **Comment Body:** Just made this wonderful loaf! I did not bother with a towel or parchment paper. I simply oiled the bowl in which the dough was resting and before the two hour rest, I dusted the oiled bowl with cornmeal. When the Dutch oven was hot, the dough easily lifted out and I plopped it cornmeal side down.  Perfect results! I must say that the dough looked far too loose\soft as compared to other breads that I’ve made but I’m happy to say that it turned out great. Will certainly be making this regularly.

Activate your yeast in about a 1/4 cup of water and 1/2 tsp of sugar using some of the 350 g of water 3. Sub 50 g of the flour with whole wheat or rye flour. 4. Bubbly wet is good. Sprinkle some flour on top and use a bench scraper to fold and shape the dough. Lots of online videos for guidance for shaping dough. with practice you'll be a pro.

- **Comment Body:** The process of flipping the bread into the pan can be messy, and the dough can stick to the pan if not dusted with flour.  I have started to manipulate the tea towel by lifting the edges and gently tapping the underside with my finger to flick the excess flour onto the dough just before putting it in the pan.  This gives the dough one last dusting and reduces the mess.  Excellent, beautiful bread every time.

We are fortunate to have the space to have hung on to a Romertopf clay cooker that has been rarely used for anything but baking bread (actually 2 of them-- found the second one at Goodwill). This bread dough is fairly loose-- so it needs a pot rather than a pizza stone in order to raise the sides. W/most pots you'll get a nice enough crust and some lift, but in a CLAY pot you'll get BRICK OVEN results!  Delish and gorgeous!

- **Comment Body:** Anything w/sides if you want a loaf to use for sandwiches.  A pizza stone is awesome if you don't mind the dough spreading like a fat foccacia (reduce the baking time).  Even a very clean red clay flower pot would make for a fantastic crust and lots of lift (cover the hole with a bit of foil).  VERY IMPORTANT:  Be sure to pre-heat your clay pot (or pizza stone) so the sticky dough doesn't get into the pores-- the heat seals the crust right off & makes it easy to get the loaf out.

- **Comment Body:** For step 3 I shaped the dough and placed it into a  Le Creuset Dutch oven lined with parchment paper for the final rise. I preheated the oven to 500 degrees.  After the final rise I placed the non preheated Dutch oven with dough inside into the preheated 500 degree oven and immediately turned the heat down to 450 Degrees.  Then I baked for 30 minutes with the lid on and about 20 minutes with the lid off until browned.  This was easier than using towels and putting dough into a hot Dutch oven.

- **Comment Body:** Yes, you can, lined with parchment paper. Dutch ovens trap the steam released from the dough and make a perfect crust. To replicate that effect, put another rimmed cookie sheet or pan on the lower rack as your oven is heating up to 450. Have a cup of water ready. Put the dough in the oven to bake and very quickly pour the water on the preheated cookie-sheet and close.  I use my 1c measuring cup to pour the water, the handle makes it much easier.

- **Comment Body:** I am a Home Ec teacher and I made this bread last week. I let it rise 24 hours. I did the last rising on parchment paper so I just lifted the paper/dough up and put it into pan. I let the oven preheat for about 20 minutes but did not preheat pan. The bread turned out great!The only thing I would change next time is to add slightly more salt. It’s amazing how great this product is for almost no effort and no money.

- **Comment Body:** Super super easy and tasty! Never fails to produce an excellent crumb. I've started adding rosemary, thyme, and fennel seeds and it is so amazing and flavorful. Adding sesame seeds in with the cornmeal is also very fun. Try 1.5X the ingredients and if you want to make a larger loaf!

- **Comment Body:** Mark Bittman updated the recipe in 2006 based on more experimentation and readers' notes. I find the dough impossible to handle, thought I should add more flour, but by WEIGHT 3 cups of flour is 430 grams, so I stuck with that. Many people prefer a bit more salt, e.g. 2 teaspoons.

- **User Display Name:** kateoz
- **Comment Body:** This bread couldn’t be easier.   The first time I made it I think it was too wet (used the 430g flour and 390ml water). On my second go I planned to use approx 360ml water but accidentally poured in 410ml. I added an extra 50g flour and an extra 1/16 tsp of yeast - and it must be a forgiving recipe because I think today’s bread is close to perfect.   It’s winter in Melbourne but I put the bread on the water heater to rise. Works well.

It all seems too good to be true...right up until you take it out of the oven and squeal with delight at the beautiful loaf your simple mixture of flour, yeast, salt, and water has created. Baked in a large enamel pot and dusted with flour- turned out just perfectly. Beautiful texture and a crust that reminds me of artisan breads bought at Saturday morning farmer’s markets.

A band of parchment paper about 4" wide fits inside the bowl to prevent sticking on the sides. The bread doesn't rise to the top of the bowl, so no parchment paper or oil needed on the inside top of the bowl.

With the basic recipe divide the dough in half to make two loaves rather than one big loaf. I sprinkle some coarse corn meal in the pre-heated pots before I dump the dough in, score the tops (carefully, in the hot pots), then follow the same baking instructions as Lahey's recipe. Lahey = Nobel Prize for Bread (!).

- **Comment Body:** I think, gods forbid, there's an error in this "adaptation" of Jim Lahey's classic. Bittman's recipe calls for 430gm flour and 390ml water, which differs from Lahey's original, which calls for 400 and 300 respectively. Lahey's innovation (among others) was to reduce the classic 5:3 proportion of flour to water to 4:3, which makes a moist, sticky, but manageable dough. Increasing the water to close to 1:1 makes a wet, unworkable dough. I've tried it, it doesn't work. Stick to the original

Did I use the wrong amount? No, even scaling back was still too salty...  Well, turns out it was because I was using Morton's brand kosher salt. It is TWICE AS SALTY as Diamond Crystal kosher salt!

Adapts beautifully to stuffing with various things- I’ve tried olives, sundried tomatoes, cherry peppers- the possibilities are endless. I just fold in the filling right before the second proof. I also echo what others have said- skip the towel. I just dump it out on oiled parchment after the first proof, add fillings, fold the dough and pick it up using the parchment. Best recipe ever!

- **Comment Body:** If you're substituting sourdough starter for yeast you'll really have a tough time with this recipe as is. Starter interacts in a unique way. Part of the magic of the no-knead is wet dough & slow fermentation. At this point the "lightly flour" in step two won't matter because you're making a different bread. I would follow a sourdough recipe. They'll be so much more helpful. Only following some of these steps will make it really tough to deliver a great product.

The loaf comes out of the oven sticking to the bottom of the dutch oven, but after cooling for 30 minutes or so, it naturally unsticks as it contracts.

- **Comment Body:** I modified the process a bit. After the 12 - 18 hour rise, use a silicone-bladed spatula to pull the dough away from the sides of the bowl and pull it over itself. With spatula then punch down the dough and break any large bubbles. Let sit for another 1 - 2 hours. When oven is hot remove the dutch oven, take off its lid (careful!!), then turn out the dough from the bowl directly into dutch oven. Replace lid and cook as per recipe. Less mess, works great after a couple of tries.

- **Comment Body:** I've been using starter rather than dry yeast for years and the truth is I've never measured it.  I just mix a couple of dollops of the starter into the liquid ingredients before adding to the flour.  Probably enough to raise the liquid to at least 1 3/4 cups, but not enough to reach 2 cups.  I don't know if results might vary depending on how robust or how thick/thin your starter is. My takeaway from my imprecision is when adding starter you've got some wiggle room.  I've had no failures.

My tips: I dissolve the yeast in warm water before mixing with the flour and salt. Instead of putting the dough on a towel and then tossing into the pan, I let the dough do it's second rise on a sheet of parchment. When it's ready, I just pick up the parchment, put it in the pot, put the lid on, bake. Easier, cleaner, no stick.

Yesterday I was out of that cornmeal so had to improvise.  Instead I used a very coarse cornmeal intended for polenta.  It was terrific!  It added some crunch to the crust and looked very attractive to boot.  That's what I'm using from now on.

- **Comment Body:** I prepared the dough the night before a camping trip, and baked it in a Dutch oven using hot coals from our campfire to rave reviews. If the weather ever gets warmer, it should be an easy recipe to prepare entirely at camp, but it wasn't warm enough outside for the dough to rise this weekend.

- **Comment Body:** A less fussy approach is to proof the dough in your Dutch oven, covered, and bake as is. If you leave the Dutch oven in your oven while it preheats, it will slightly reduce the proof time required.  Also, if you mix in two Tbsp of gluten to the flour mix, your crust will turn out more crunchy like an Artisan bread. Einkorn flour adds a lot of flavor compared to typical bread flour.   Also, most store bought yeasts stop fermenting far more quickly than wild yeast, so a long proof is not useful.

- **User Display Name:** Ben
- **Comment Body:** Someone asked why their dough was so liquid-y and their bread turned out rubbery. I have found this recipe can be too wet, especially in a humid climate. Try reducing the liquid until you can form the dough into a ball and not have your hands completely coated and sticky with dough. Plenty of steam is trapped in the Dutch oven as the bread bakes. This ratio of water to flour makes more sense in a dry, high altitude kitchen in Denver but may not work well in Miami or Houston.

- **User Display Name:** Trilby
- **Comment Body:** This was a new recipe for me.  I made this bread twice this week, weighing the ingredients, with great success.  The first time, on Sunday, the "dough" was more like a thick batter; I had to add almost an extra cup of flour before it became a "shaggy", cohesive ball. Today, I only had to use the 430 grams of flour, without adding any extra. The difference?  On Sunday, it rained all day long.  Today was clear.  I'm assuming that the higher humidity on Sunday required more flour in the dough.

I used stale limpy cilantro but I would have preferred scallions, or fresh cilantro. I used somen noodles and they were perfect. Chopped some nuts for crunch/protein and it was a hit. Smashed it.

The one (unintentional) change is we planned to make a full batch of sauce and save half; we promptly forgot and mixed in the half pound of pasta directly. We actually liked the double sauce because the sauce was so good.   Added the pasta to the pan with sauce instead of the opposite. Also not sure it’s a main dish unaccompanied unless it’s midnight and you’re a couple drinks in in which case get after it.

We will go with 2 or even 1 tbsp next time.  Green onions as a topper gave the perfect fresh / allium crunch.  Ultimately it was a very tasty recipe, we would just turn down the sweet.

Like butter, sesame oil is low heat fat so it’s important not to use too much heat.   I also added kimchi. I rough chopped a half cup of kimchi, pan fried it until the colour darkened, then added it to the noodles.   Outstanding lunch.

So nice to be able to make a dish with items already in our pantry, which included Gochujang sauce (rather than paste) and that was just fine.  We skipped the vinegar, added a little honey, and sprinkled with chopped peanuts for crunch. Liked the suggestion from someone here to remove the pasta from the water with tongs and place it in the saucepan. The little bit of starchy water clinging to the hot spaghetti added a silky feel to the sauce. Thanks!

There must be a flavor or taste that hits me at my core with the multiple layers here in each bite. My mouth went nuts and I was thinking, wait, why do I taste sweet. I recalled the honey which went in with the vinegar. Amazing combinations of perfect ingredients. The honey I used by the way, came from our very own bees and I had made hot honey using a jalapeño last week.

It takes a little longer to cook the sauce.  Fish sauce is a must to cut the sweetness of the honey, and using a whole bunch (about 5) green onions, and a whole bunch of cilantro, really rounds out the flavor, not to mention adding a little green to the dish. Stand out recipe for sure!

Grabbed a bunch of rather sorry looking veggies (mushroom, zucchini, onion, daikon radish) out of the fridge, chopped them up, sautéed them, made the sauce, tossed it all together with the noodles - pretty tasty!  Reminded me of Pad Thai - next time I’ll use rice noodles, lime juice instead of vinegar, top with peanuts.

### Recipe: Gochujang Buttered Noodles

- **User Display Name:** Delicious
- **Comment Body:** Used 4 Tbs of avocado oil instead of butter and forgot to add the additional 2 tbs. Still turned out great but was a little dry so next time will use all the oil/butter recommended. Followed recommendation to add crushed salted peanuts in addition to scallions. That was a great addition. Used less honey as recommended by some (used 1 tbsp). Had to add sugar to balance things out so next time will use 2 tbsp of honey. Also added frozen edamame to pasta near the end of cooking time. Amazing.

- **Comment Body:** Made this tonight.  Really good.  I added a splash of light soy sauce at the end which filled my need for a little more salt.  Also cut the honey by a bit, maybe half, just my preference.   Served with Sauteed Bok Choy a la Sam Sifton.  Great counterpart.   I am ducking as I say that next time I might try half gochujang and half doubanjiang in the mix.   I was wanting some earthiness, but that's just me.  Something different from original recipe intent, but fun to try.

- **Comment Body:** I could not find gochujang paste at all in any of my grocery stores (I'm in Montana!). I don't know if gochujang sauce is stronger or weaker, but I would just say go easy because you can always add more later. The first time I made this it was inedible (my fault), but the last two times, these noodles were positively addictive. I attribute to going a little easy on the spice until you get exactly what you want. Thank you Eric Kim for a wonderful recipe.

- **Comment Body:** I know I'll get nowhere with the average NYT reader but the fear of MSG is an old wive's tale and was thoroughly disproven decades ago. MSG is simply a purified form of glutamate, which is a flavor compound found in everything from mushrooms to anchovies. Adding msg is no different and no more harmful than add adding powdered lemon juice (citric acid) for tanginess, or sugar for sweetness, or salt. Latest science indicates glutamate, far from being harmful, is probably beneficial.

Read the new research! If you just don't care for fat, chill this dish in the fridge or freezer then skim the hardened fat off. How could 4 Tbs of butter distributed through a whole dish with a lot of it left at the bottom of the crockpot be bad for you? Strikes me as paranoia.

Add dill, garlic, a little paprika...and the pepperoncini - I cut the tops off and occasionally take out seeds. Or, buy pepperoncini rings. I used to drain it, but seriously, no.ADD TWO LEFTOVER BEERS. Enough to cover meat! Add two bouillon cubes; cook til it falls apart. Chicago Style Italian Beef. Voila.

- **Comment Body:** People are afraid of mayo because they don't know what it is -- but it's basically just egg yolk, oil and water.  It serves as kind of a time-release moisture enhancer in recipes like this, and the lecithin in the egg yolk help to thicken and emulsify the sauce at the end.In other words, it isn't essential, it just makes the meat slightly moister and the final sauce maybe a little creamier.

Set the pressure cooker to HIGH for 60 minutes (30 min per pound).  Use a natural release (15-30 min) and release. Shred meat, return to pot for shocking delicious-ness.

- **Comment Body:** Converting from a slow cooker to cast iron has a # of variables, like cooking on a stove vs oven or slower cooking time vs faster than the crock pot. Rule of thumb is for cooking in the oven at 325 it's 1/4 time if the recipe calls for low and 1/2 time for high. If you want to cook slower in the oven, adjust the temp & do the math. There's a simple chart for this on the Cooking in Cast Iron web site, as well as many other cooking sites. Google it and you'll see.

I make the Georgia version using my mother's recipe, which was actually her mother's recipe and goes back to the 1950s or earlier. Leave out everything except the onion soup mix. Use water. You can add some marsala near the end. Best served over long-grain rice.

Just as the brown fond begins to turn, add two tbs of unsalted butter to the bottom of the pan, underneath the meat.Spread package of dry ranch dressing mix on top of the meat, and lay two tbsp of butter on top.  Add 1/4 cup of beef stock and 12 pepperoncini, first rinsing off brine under the faucet. 3 hours at 300 degrees.

I find modern slow cookers to sometimes just be too hot, boiling on low is a no-no for me. Your results may vary. Play with it a little bit. Braising is very forgiving if you cook to slow, not as forgiving if you cook too fast, in my experience.

Next time I might skip the broth bcz too much liquid.  Even so, the flavor is amazing! Will definitely make this again. Thank you, Sam Sifton, for the recipe!

Gluten free flours/blends do not brown well, so I personally would skip gluten free flour blends.  Browning can be done without flour.If your guests are celiac, then its important to ensure there is no hidden gluten.  Common items with gluten include soy sauce, bouillon, blue cheese, hot dogs, seasoning blends, and sauces.

- **Comment Body:** People are asking why not just use packaged dressing, au jus etc.  Some people have restricted diets but love good food.  I cook for my mom who has heart issues and gout and my brother who in is renal failure. Packaged and  canned foods are a veritable NO.  So I do have to substitute fresh homemade for packaged stuff and absolutely no canned soups or sauces. Cooking without canned and prepackaged flavorings are healthier for everyone but not nearly as easy quick.

- **Comment Body:** I'd add a deglazing step. You are searing the chuck to put a crust on it (and it can be a long hard sear because this is all going to be stewed anyway). You end up with nice fond in the pan that you want to add to the stock, plus a good bit of rendered fat. Use the rendered fat instead of butter. So deglaze that pan with chicken broth or wine or even water. I would also add granulated garlic. And consider some MSG or fish sauce -- umami, baby.

Once Roast is "falling apart" remove from the pot and carefully remove and scrape the bottom of the pot to loosen up the fond, maybe add little more water. Enjoy the "fat gravy" over the meat and rice. Louisiana Roast.

Then, after searing the chuck in oil as directed, I dropped it into a preheated covered dutch oven at 275 degrees. While the roast started cooking, I mixed 1 1/2 cups original heat salsa, 1/2 cup catsup, chopped onions and garlic, 2 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, 2 tablespoons thyme, and 1 cup red wine, which I had precooked until thickened, and added to the pot....WOW

- **Comment Body:** I made this precisely as Sam suggested and loved it. After 7 hours, my 3.5 pound roast was fork tender and tangy. At first, I didn't think there would be enough liquid to cook the meat, but as the butter and the fat from the roast melted, there was more than enough fluid to cook and meld the flavors. I did flip the roast after the first few hours.Were I to make it again, I'd probably use 20 pepperoncinis, as they disintegrate quite a bit by the time the roast is cooked.

So when I took it out of the fridge the fat was congealed on top of all the liquid. I just removed it, heated at all up, shredded it, and used only the liquid/gravy that was left. Perfect! Next time (and there will be a next time -lol) I'll use much less butter.

- **Comment Body:** Pepperoncini (which I think are what you mean) are the smallish (around 2" long), light-green, mildly hot pickled peppers that can be found in any grocery store, at least here in New England. They are a staple addition to subs (hoagies? heroes?  what's your regional term?), and their distinctive, vinegary aroma is found in many a sandwich shop in these parts.

I got a very good quality chuck roast so it was not fatty; i used an entire bottle of pepperoncini but next time would follow the 8-10 recommendation  as the whole jar made it a bit too hot in my view.  My only adjustment was about 8 cloves of roasted garlic, 3 of raw garlic, and half a sliced onion.  I cooked it on low slow cooker setting for 9 hours.  Make this, honest!

I used the homemade ranch dressing suggested by Rosie in the comments (so YES to the buttermilk and more dried mustard/paprika).  Already chopped jarred pepperoncini (Mezzetta) all the better. Will be even tastier tomorrow on a sandwich with slaw or shredded lettuce.  Anyone complaining of little flavor isn't  salting/peppering or browning properly.

Don't have a slow cooker, so I used a Dutch oven; 6 1/2 hours at 250. I used a round roast, ~2.75 lb. To shred, I cut it across the grain into 1-in. hunks, then shredded those. We loved it. Used leftovers for enchiladas. Wonderful! I may make in the future for that purpose alone.

- **Comment Body:** I agree with the criticisms of this method. What is the point of "whisk to emulsify" a homemade salad dressing when the very process of cooking with it will break the emulsion? There must be a way that makes the classic recipe "homemade" with your own spices, buttermilk, etc. but avoids the necessity to mess up a bowl and take the time to prepare something that will instantly undo itself in the crockpot. Just add buttermilk/spices to crockpot, skip the mayo and whisking.

While browning, combine 2 T buttermilk powder and about 4 t Penzey Buttermilk Ranch mix with some beer (low hop - I used Weyerbacher Merry Monk triple ale) to make a slurry.  Pour slurry over roast, add the rest of 12 oz. beer to Dutch oven with about 10 pepperoncini and some of their liquid and 1/2 stick of butter.

- **Comment Body:** This was a big hit! I adapted this recipe in two ways:  1. I added some spices to enhance the dressing flavor, per the NYT Classic Ranch Dressing recipe by Julia Moskin.  2. I cooked my roast in an Instant Pot - 60 minutes on high pressure for 5 lbs of beef. Natural release for 15 minutes, then manual release with a towel afterward. I had a lot of meat so seared some of it in the IP and some of it in another pan on the stove.

- **Comment Body:** I tried this with a 4 lb chicken, cut in half to fit the crock pot.   All else was the same.   Not only was it delicious, but I then deboned the leftovers and used the sauce (including the pepperoncini) to make chicken and dumplings.  They were spicy and extremely flavorful.  I added 4 cups chicken broth, made dumplings and added the cut-up, deboned chicken meat.

- **Comment Body:** I might be wrong, but I am assuming the first mention of 8 hrs guidance is for setting a timer.  Once the timer/temp is set/programmed, mix the ranch dressing.  As you are mixing the dressing the slow cooker will be heating up with meat inside. Add the ranch dressing after the cooker is heated, and allow to cook for the 8 hour duration set in step 2.

- **Comment Body:** Great recipe. I use 3.5lb chuck roast and it takes 6-7 hours. Three modifications: sauté onion and garlic in the frying pan after frying the meat and add them in. When the roast is ready to be shredded trim the big pieces of fat before shredding the rest of the meat outside of the slow-cooker. Then take out the peppers and use an immersion blender to blend the sauce. Put peppers back for serving. If it's too greasy put sauce in the freezer for a little while and then skim the fat off the top.

- **Comment ID:** 22155412
- **User Display Name:** Southern Cook
- **Comment Body:** The reason for the butter is because chuck is a tough cut of beef, often trimmed of excess fat by the butcher. Butter tenderizes the meat. Why bother with homemade ranch dressing? The package has all the ingredients needed, garlic, onion, herbs, etc. Cooking should be easy. Mississippi roast is easy and delicious. Don't worry about the butter. If you eat ice cream with its high fat content or ground chuck in hamburgers or meatloaf you probably get more fat than in a serving of the roast.

You'll always find butter (often with parsley and shallots in it) on top of a fancy steak in a good steak house. And any good pan sauce is "mounted" with butter at the end to emulsify it.

Browned it well in skillet before transferring to the slowcooker w 1/4 c water.  Added the powdered ranch and au jus (3/4 packet each to reduce the sodium), loads of pepperoncini, and the butter.  Low for 8-1/2 hours - fantastic!

About 2 hrs of cooking added a can of coconut milk.  At 8hrs put into a deep skillet and cooked off some of the liquid since it seemed a bit soupy.  I don’t want to brag, but that was excellent - like Mississippi Roast meets greek cousin and go to The Caribbean.  Tasty - very tasty.  Served on a bed of riced cauliflower - yum.

The pepperoncini become quite neutralized when cooked, and were such a great compliment to the meat, so I too would add more pepperoncini and their juices the next time. Also would maybe even add a hint more of cayenne in the ranch sauce (which I had also doctored up with garlic powder, onion powder, ground mustard and dried parsley). Followed the directions from Chodo for using instant pot - spot on!

Add to that the fact that the butter was salted, and, well, you can guess how it tasted. Yikes! It’s my fault, but it is still good.

- **Comment Body:** An older note about making the dressing mentioned that it separates while cooking, so I do as that cook did: add the dressing ingredients to the pot without bothering to emulsify.  I seldom have buttermilk, so I substitute yogurt.  I don't think you can kill this recipe--it's brilliant.  Thank you, Sam.

- **Comment Body:** It's 2 degrees F, it's snowing, it's Texas.  Looking at a landscape of perfect white fluffiness, I decided to make this roast.  It's a perfect day to fill the air with the smell of a roast cooking in the crockpot.  Between the pandemic, and the bitterly cold weather, I'm not leaving the house for several days and this will be the perfect winter meal.  To go with it?  No knead lovely bread cooked in the wrought iron dutch oven.  Thank you SO much for the inspiration...

- **Comment Body:** The mayo because it contains eggs and lecithin is kind of an emulsifier. It adds fat and will help the sauce. But you're right, cream or mustard could function in the same way. So could an egg yolk that is blended into something before it cooks. Adds creaminess.Mayo is kind of a hot ingredient among chefs right now. Great way to add moistness to things like burgers and meatloaf. It melts during cooking so nobody knows mayo was added.

Enameled ironware ( like Le Creuset) is great, but there are other pots which work well both for browning and braising ( "roasting"  ). This way you also get every last bit of the browned flavor

I skimmed at least a cup of grease from the pot before mixing and serving the remaining gravy.  This recipe NEEDS (onions? garlic? something.) I'll stick to my late mother's amazing recipe for delicious pot roast that she also cooked all day. I strayed from that recipe to try this, and I learned my lesson.

We sliced it and put it in the refrigerator. Put the sauce in the refrigerator and skimmed the fat once it solidified. Then back in the slow cooker for another 2 hours with the skimmed sauce. Shredded easily after the second round. Delicious. We'll make it again.

I also cut a large onion into thick slices and put half of them in the bottom of the crock pot and half on top of the chuck roast.  The dressing did curdle, but I ladled out most of the onions and pepperoncini then whizzed it all up in the blender.  Added it back to the pot with the reserved onions, peppers and shredded meat.  This is surprisingly delicious.  Served over orzo.

Recently I’ve started the habit of making it, then dividing the shredded meat into around 2 oz separate portions (one roast can yield 15-20 portions) and then immediately freezing them. It is very handy to grab one or two portions to add to a quick breakfast, lunch or dinner as part of a quesadilla, broth noodle soup, grits, or any number of other meals. I’ve found many different uses for it and enjoy the convenience of this approach.

Parts that are outside the liquid that fills the bottom for the duration don't get cooked as well and often don't shred easily.  I've also started switching the machine to HIGH for the last two hours of the 8 hour cycle.  I'm almost considering cutting the meat into large chunks before putting it in the pot next time to see if that helps to get more even cooking.

- **Comment Body:** I'd guess that the answer depends on what you object to in the pepperoncini -- the pepper itself, or the vinegar.  I'm sure that both contribute to the distinctive flavor of the dish, and the vinegar probably helps tenderize the meat.  If you want the heat and not the vinegar, perhaps a bit of jalapeño.  If it's peppers you dislike, just use a bit of vinegar (or cider vinegar?  or balsamic vinegar?)

- **Comment Body:** I prepared the Sifton recipe exactly as written. The meat was quite tasty, but the sauce separated and was very unappealing. Next time I'll go with the original recipe. After cooking, I strained the liquid in a fat separator (it was over 25% fat, so definitely necessary), discarded the curdled-looking milky solids (yuck) along with the fat, and reduced into a sauce.The cooked pepperoncini were the best part of this dish. Sweet, tangy, buttery, melt-in-your-mouth morsels of goodness!

Seems like it might be closer to the original recipe. Has anyone tried this? I confess I've never heard of dry au jus gravy, but similarly, I know there are some organic gravy mixes they sell.

At 3 1/2 hours, I poured off the fat, and replaced it with a couple cups of home-made beef broth. The three chowhounds I served it to loved it, and didn't leave me with any leftovers (which was part of the plan). Will definitely make it again!

I pulled out the roast, brought the sauce to a boil, added back the meat, coarsely chopped and stirred twice.It was magic.The flour clinging to the meat brought it all together.It was rich, indulgent & delicious. Served with Hoppin' John & Succotash.

- **Comment Body:** I'm in the "hot, grey mess" camp. I separated the sauce from the meat, separated the butter back out of the sauce by putting it in the fridge, then strained the sauce because it contained lots of ugly glop. The resulting sauce did taste delicious. We cooked pappardelle pasta and I used the clarified butter with parmesan to make an alfredo, then put the meat on top with some juice. Not bad, but not viral-worthy.

Only flavor is beef, which is OK, but nothing else comes through.  Don't waste your time on this one.  There are far more flavorful ways to make a pot roast--use garlic, onions, mirepoix, tomato, wine etc.  As presented, this recipe offers nothing of interest; glad we tried it before serving it to guests.

The flavor was fair at best, even though I know it was done because it shredded beautifully. As far as all that butter??? Yikes! There was plenty of fat from the chuck roast, even after all the necessary skimming. There are so many more slow cooker recipes that far outshine this one.

Maybe because it was grass-fed, it did not turn out greasy as some people have experienced.

It has a little bit of zing from the peppers and the ranch as far as I can tell just added more fat to the equation. Not awful but imho there are much better ways to prepare a chuck roast.

Serving the next day was somewhat better;once chilled, I could remove some of the grease.  Even so, the roast was bland.  I liked the pepperocinis, but adding 10 of them didn't make them stand out too much.  We added several ingredients to make the roast stand out after the fact, including more black pepper, salt, pepperocinis, and beef broth.

Suggest mild pepperoncini (half a jar) with a little juice, used bottled ranch dressing without preservatives, 1/2 c beef broth. Dont worry about amount of liquid this is more like slow cooked BBQ than traditional braise, after about 4.5 hours @ 300 shredded beautifully. Added slurry, red wine, shot of worchester to gravy, delicious.

- **Comment Body:** Have made this Mississippi Roast a few times and always a hit.  I double the ranch dressing and use at least the 12 pepperocini/greek chillis.  At the end of the cooking time I do take out the meat and chillis and whisk as there's always a bit of curdling of mayo/buttermilk.  Usually it whisks up nicely and I mix back in the shredded meat and peppers.  Serve with Mashed potatoes and coleslaw is my recommendation. My son makes a sandwich with shredded beef leftovers the next day. All good!

The first day, it seemed very spicy but after I refrigerated it overnight (after which I pulled out the excess fat), it was much more mellow.         I did this in my instant pot, so I could brown it on the sauce function & keep it in the same pan to slow cook. I wanted to compare it later with a pressure cooked roast. I discovered that "low" on the IP is too low to cook anything this century

This time I rubbed the raw roast with only pepper and flour, added a little salt about an hour before the dish was done. Also added half a large red onion sauteed in the pan drippings. Next time will cut butter in half and put diced onion in raw - the finished dish was very good, but sort of oily.

I made this exactly as called for in the recipe, and as others have mentioned it's even better on Day 2 and Day 3. From Day 2 onwards it's much less salty. Tastes like home!   DON'T skip the browning of the meat on all sides! I used a 12" cast iron skillet heated for 20 minutes in a 500 degree oven, then immediately moved to stovetop to start the browning. The most amazing sear & explosion of flavors in the roast!

- **Comment Body:** I was a little skeptical that this recipe could be worthy of the raves, but it was awarded the coveted 5* rating in our house last night. I made it in a Dutch oven (Le Creuset) braising it at 250 degrees for four hours. I used 12 pepperoncini which gave it a little more kick than some in our house like, so I would dial back on that next time. It was great over noodles.

Added a pound of white mushrooms to release moisture and add to the pan sauce for the last 90 minutes and they morphed into little flavor bombs-delish!!  Even better the next day...

Thickened the sauce a little with roux at the end and served with roasted carrots and potatoes. And there’s leftover gravy!  Dreaming about how to use it.

- **Comment Body:** This is on regular rotation in our house. I typically use pork shoulder and cut it into large chunks. It's an extra step, but I find the meat turns out more tender and flavorful that way. For the dressing (guys, come on, it takes less than 5 minutes to mix it together and skip it if you really object), I actually pass on the mayonnaise and just use 3 full tablespoons of buttermilk instead. Oh, and definitely amp up the pepperoncini or add some of the juice if you want it spicy.

- **Comment Body:** I’ve made this three or four times now and we love it. There are only two of us, so I freeze the leftovers. The meat is great on a toasted bun with melted provolone. It is pretty fatty when made with chuck - I haven’t tried a round roast yet. It might be a good idea to make it a day ahead so you could skim off the fat. Love the pepperoncini flavor. I used 8 and poured maybe 1/3 of a cup of the juice in too. Zippy, without being too much for my Midwestern-raised palate.

I have to say, I am so glad Rosie Tunes shared her recipe for homemade ranch dressing. I had some buttermilk leftover and made the dressing and we LOVED it.  Can wait to use it on many things.

When I came home, dejected from teaching two classes to students who won't talk, it was cooked to perfection and served with roasted potatoes and salad and puffy white dinner rolls and it made me forget about my burnout.

- **Comment Body:** I just found this recipe last fall and have made it 3 times. (Just two of us so I divide into smaller portions and freeze.)  We were eating it in sandwiches but recently also started using it as filling for tacos. I took an idea from a slow-cooker pork carnitas recipe—place the cooked meat into a frying pan, let it cook undisturbed till it starts to brown up and get a bit crispy on the edges which brings the flavor to the next level. I leave out the pepperocini and add a bit more vinegar.

The next day I remove the congealed fat on top and shred the meat, removing gristle, too; finish the recipe, and serve it.  This pot roast is one of those lucky recipes, easy, forgiving and delicious.

- **Comment Body:** Third try is the charm. After making this with mediocre results the first two times (following the recipe to a T), we tried it in the Dutch oven at 250 as mentioned by Sam. After 3 hours it was at 180, so we consulted America's Test Kitchen which said it needs to be at 200 for 60 min: upped the heat to 350 for 20-30 min to get it to 200 internal temp, then 300 for another 30 min. Our crockpot must not get the internal temp to 200 for long enough...next time we'll do Dutch oven 300 for 3-4 hrs.

You could defat the sauce if you wanted, but I found it unnecessary (perhaps my roast was not very fatty, I did trim it a little bit first).   2. It's the easiest thing in the world. The payoff is very high for the effort.   3. I'm always amused by people who say "I did this, but changed 12 things about the recipe." If you do that it could be quite delicious, but it's not this recipe.  Make it. It's a great recipe.

But no need, the outcome was tasty, It passed the ultimate pot roast test; it tasted better the next day.

- **Comment Body:** I saw this as a chance to start using the gallon jug of pepperoncini I bought at the restaurant supply store on Thu. for $6. No slow cooker, used a dutch oven at 275F for 3 hours after browning. The ranch dressing was kind of a curdled mess sitting on top of the beef at the end, but by the time I shredded everything it had incorporated nicely. Added a can of beef broth to the braise. Served it over some of those vac-pack gnocchi that I sauteed until crispy then briefly steamed to plump them up.

- **Comment Body:** We cooked this tonight. Based on the reviews, I thought it would be great. But the flavor was just so-so. To be sure, compared with many slow cooker recipes it was flavorful. But ever since I've started cooking out of "Slow Cooker Revolution," my bar has been raised significantly. Unlikely to make it again. There are other better ATK recipes.

- **Comment Body:** I made my roast exactly the same as you did...theoriginal recipe in a Dutch Oven, 4 1/2 hrs at 275-300degrees and it was very good. I think some of thefolks that had only fair or bad results perhaps used therevised version that just doesn't come together as easily as the original.This was so easy! Oh, I did add extra peppers with some of the brine.

- **Comment Body:** I think the main point of the pepperoncinis is the acid, which helps to cut the richness of the meat. I would think some quick-pickled onions might be better than simply sauteed onions. Just a thought. Sauerkraut could work as well - in the end I think it would contribute acidity and probably just sort of melt into the dish.

I used the same pan to brown the meat, before adding the other ingredients.  I also added about a cup of wine.  I cooked the roast in a 300 degree oven for 3-1/2 hours.

- **Comment Body:** I cooked a well-trimmed 4 lb chuck roast in the crockpot after browning. Used half the butter and results were very little fat to skim.  Shredding tip from my son: put on gloves, then rub the cooked beef between your fingers.  Shreds nicely even if the roast isn't falling apart. Much easier than forks!

I used more pepperoncinis than in the original. Added some hot sauce as well.  Cooked for about 6 hrs at slightly under 300.  Came out wonderful, full of flavor.  No 'grey mess' issues as discussed in other comments.

- **Comment Body:** Absolutely irresistible. We'd intended to wait for a late-ish dinner, but once we tasted the dish we got out the plates and dug in. The only adjustments we made were to cut the butter in half and use low-fat mayo, so that the meat wasn't as rich as some people have noted. We're not huge red meat fans but will definitely make this again.

Cook on high for 4 hours first, then reduce to low. Can serve atop sautéed kale. Use the full 12 pepperoncini, and add some of the liquid. Double the dressing amount. Add some dry mustard & paprika to dressing.

Normally I'm a big fan of strong flavors, but if there's a next time I'll reduce these.

Defatted the juices and thickened with a little cornstarch slurry on the stove.   We loved the pepperoncini and I think that made the dish. I have never made the "original" version with the seasoning packets and don't plan to.  This version was great.  Leftovers will be nachos tomorrow night.  Don't overthink this.  Simple and delicious.

And I love Sam Sifton, but this is dag nasty. I got prime chuck from Costco, the whole nine yards. I thought the weird recipe would yield a miracle, as may internet stars have before, and this one is not it. Horrible gamey flavor, enhanced by none of the weird ingredients. Yuk overall.

- **Comment Body:** This ended up a greasy mess. Chuck roasts are always a little greasy and I should have known better. If I make it again I will leave out the butter and make it a day ahead so I can pick off the hardened fat before I shred the beef. Also, I wasn't clear on what to do with the peppers. Do you shred them up with the meat or pull them out and put them on the side or get rid of them?It turned out to have a nice flavor that made it different from the standard pot roast.

I'm not normally a beef eater and I liked it, and my husband was so enchanted he told his colleagues about it at work the next day.I had a bottle of nice ranch dressing in the fridge so I just added a splotch of that on top of the roast. My ~3.25lb roast required the full eight hours to achieve a fork-shreddable tenderness.

When it was finished cooking, I corrected the salt and pepper and added some pepperoncini brine to the shredded meat.  We enjoyed it with mashed potatoes and Smitten Kitchen's broccoli slaw (but I cheated and used a bag of shredded broc). Definitely looking forward to sandwiches with the leftovers!

A little less butter works fine, since chuck is fatty. Note to self, resist turning over the roast! It curdles the dressing, and then I had to fix it with roux and broth. But still yummy.

I skimmed the fat off the top at the end of cooking.  I gave it my best effort and still had an oily, fatty, mess that was difficult to choke down.  I'd give it zero stars but that is not an option.  This is the first bad recipe from the NYT.  I guess I was due for one sooner or later.

- **Comment Body:** Hey Steve, I think round is a much different cut of meat (much leaner).  Chuck has a LOT of fat.  I googled "Canadian for chuck roast" and the results were "blade roast" or shoulder roast.  Some suggested that the kosher butcher shops were more likely to know what this roast was. I also used my Instant Pot as a pressure cooker, and only for an hour. The result did not come near the deliciousness I've had with the same recipe in the IP slow cooker for 7 hours.

- **Comment Body:** Thought this was just "fine". Suppose the flavor profile isn't for me. Much rather turn a chuck roast into a good beef stew. Also, the fat:flavor ratio isn't justifiable for me; I don't have a problem using lots of fat, but the dish better taste really good! This didn't cut it.

- **Comment Body:** Can we cook without mayonnaise and packaged mixes? What is happening to American cuisine, it looks like we can't cook anything unless it's got ranch dressing and mayonnaise in the recipe! Put your roast in a crockpot, cover with cajun spices, onions and garlic, and cook it. You won't miss the mayo, the butter, or the ranch.

- **Comment Body:** My mother would have simply called this Pot Roast with Pepperoncini. I say empty the small jar of those tasty little devil's, liquid and all, into the pot. Kill 2 birds with 1 stone: Make a buttermilk substitute by adding 1Tbsp apple cider or white wine vinegar to 1 cup of milk. I am also leaving out the mayo. My husband likes pepperoncini but not in his meat. I am going to take them out before presenting, then I will tell him that it was one of my mother's go-to family dishes.

- **Comment Body:** Here are my tweaks: For those who think it's too fatty (I did), reduce the butter to 2T, then while you're shredding the meat, pour the juice into a container, put it in the freezer, then skim off the fat. I like spice, so next time I'll add the entire 16oz jar of pepperoncini - all the cooking takes the heat right out of them. Also added some of their brine at the beginning. My 2.75lb chuck roast - don't use any other cut, the marbled fat in that cut is necessary for this recipe - took 6.5 hour

I added red pepper flakes, a splash of worchestershire and pepperocini brine, and upped the buttermilk to 1/2 cup. Set the Instant Pot for meat/stew 35 minutes and natural release. It was not quite done, so I pressure cooked it an additional 20 minutes on high and it was wonderful. Served it on mashed potatoes with green beans; tomorrow night piled on potato rolls with pickles.

- **Comment Body:** Works great in a pressure cooker—cut your roast into big pieces (2 or 3), sauté with a sliced onion and add ingred as directed (tweaks—cut the butter and mayo amounts by half, add 20 pepperonchinis ans sub 1-2 Tbsp fresh dill for dried).  Cook high pressure 60 minutes, natural release.  If it’s not fork tender after that, flip the meat pieces over give it another 15 min under pressure).  Shred and enjoy. FYI, leftovers are amazing encased in puff pastry—steak bakes anyone?

We used half a cube of butter and five jalapeño peppers instead of the pepperoncinis, added chipotle ranch dressing plus a medium sized minced shallot. The chuck roast weighed 3.5 lbs and was in the instapot on low for seven hours, came out perfectly. We made "Mississippi dip" sandwiches, on sourdough rolls toasted with Hatch pepper jack cheese melted on the rolls. Skimmed the fat off the gravy and used it for dipping.

If you remove the lid several times during the process, it will take much longer to cook through. Trust the crockpot to do it's job & you should have a perfect meal.

Sunday lunch was a constant trip back and forth to the stove to even out that last bite of roast with some rice and gravy, then back again to even out that rice and gravy with some more roast. Mississippi Roast has had me in and out of the fridge all week, a bite here and there. I opted for easy, had to adjust seasonings, a 250 oven was to low.

I follow Step 1 and part of Step 2 by salt and peppering the roast then 10 minutes of browning all in the pressure cooker, then I add the butter, pepperoncini and homemade ranch dressing all at once. Depending on the size of your roast, your time will vary but it's generally 50-55 minutes for a 4 lb roast. I've even cooked it from frozen, doing the same steps but for 70 min.

- **Comment Body:** I appreciate all the comments here, I should have read them more thoroughly before cooking my roast (a 4-pound chuck, grass-fed from Whole Foods). My feeling is that this is a recipe best suited to cheaper meats . . . with the wonderfully flavorful and admittedly expensive roast I had, it just was overkill. In fact, I would call it gloppy and greasy, and the ranch flavor just way over the top and too complex. It competed with the delicious grass-fed meat flavors. My husband agreed.

For anyone with an Instant Pot I see no reason to slow cook this -- just follow the recipe - sauté directly in the pot - then switch to pressure cook, set on high for 90 minutes - done and delicious.

- **Comment Body:** I had it come out tough the one time I used a bottom round roast; have never had it tough using chuck -- many many times. Cuts vary, and I take time when shredding meat to discard fatty bits, connective tissue etc, which makes a difference, imo. I use half a large jar of pepperoncini  with the liquid, and blender it roughly before adding back to meat as much as I want to moisten for that great Down East Que. Any leftover liquid never goes to waste!!

- **Comment Body:** Watch out!!  With all due respect to others...  I always review notes before cooking a new recipe. I'm also a "more-salt-is-better" kind of guy. I traditionally like pepperonchini, often adding a splash of pickling juice to mixed Italian salads.  So, I used 12, and added 1/4 cup of the juice - not a whole bottle, as recommended by a few.  While the meat alone was edible, the sauce was inedibly salty and way too tart me.  I saved it by making a white cream gravy to dilute the base sauce. Careful!

- **Comment Body:** I’ve tried this recipe out twice, really wanting hard to like it.  But alas, you’d be far better off taking your nice chunk of beef and making Pot Roast.  This recipe, besides being very fatty (even with only a 1/2 stick of butter) just has a one-note flavor, and not all that enticing.  So, no third time for me. Pot Roast has so much more favor with its carrots and potatoes and what other root veggies you want to add.   Note that this is the first time I’ve ever felt compelled to add a note.

- **Comment Body:** This is pretty similar to our home method of the famous Chicago Italian Beef.  I know they don’t use chuck in Chicago but in a slow cooker if you’re just looking for melting beef, made easily that can stand in with a crowd and you don’t have a meat slicer, well…just add some Italian herbs.

- **Comment Body:** Fantastic! Getting a good crust on all sides of the roast significantly enhanced the flavor.   Tips: Divide butter around the 4 sides of the meat. Put pepperoncini rings on top and ranch dressing under the roast. Turn meat over halfway through the cook time. Shred the beef, then pour remaining liquid (tad greasy) into a pot. While heating, skim part of the grease then add 1 tbs corn starch mixed with 2 tbs Worcestershire. Added 1 c beef stock. Cook down by 1/3. Serve over buttered egg noodles.

Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towel and place a wire rack on top. In a large, deep skillet, heat 1/2 cup oil until a drop of water flicked into pan sizzles. Working in batches, fry eggplant until just tender, 20 to 30 seconds per side. Transfer fried eggplant to rack to drain. Nice with shawarma!

Meat sliced nicely after the 10 minute post-cooking rest.  Marinated for 24 hours, cooked the chicken in the marinade, & the meat held up fine. I used a lipped cookie sheet, to avoid spills in my oven.  Everyone asked for  leftovers to take home.  Wonderful flavor, and easy to prepare.  I served it with marinated feta, pita, couscous,  moroccan carrot salad, etc.

I put everything into a large ziplock, massaged the ingredients to blend, and then added the chicken. No mess and easy to store while the birds marinates. I also used chicken breasts, bone in, skin on. Unbelievably juicy and tender, and easy to cut into smaller pieces after roasting.

Served with white sauce (1/4 cup mayo, 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt, juice of half a lemon, 1 clove garlic, minced), chickpea salad, and toasted (in a skillet) pita bread. Yum, yum, yum. Watch the chicken carefully the last 20 minutes. Even though I turned the heat down, it would have over-cooked if I'd left it in the oven for the full 40 minutes.

- **Comment Body:** I've made this countless times from the recipe by Nigella Lawson.I would recommend the thighs bone in with skin for roasting. I use a very hot oven at the start for 10 min and then reduce the temp. This renders the fat in the same way as a spit and keeps it moist. I'm always amazed how much fat renders this way.Afterwards remove the skin-if you must-and then the bones.Also recommend you find a good yeast, flour, oil based dough recipe for flat bread. Makes the dish extra special.

Somehow the mix of lemon and garlic with chicken verges on  magic. I did cut the onion in smaller pieces so it would caramelize more, and I also cut the amount of chicken to 1.5 pounds.   Didn't bother to slice it, and served with broccoli salad and roasted butternut squash. Yum.

- **Comment Body:** I've already made this recipe four times. It's been a huge hit. The only changes I have made are small -- I thinly sliced rather than quartered the red onions (some of them crisped up in a most delicious way) and I added at least two more juiced lemons to the mix because I love the punch it gave the marinade. In addition to the "served with" items above, I added a simple chutney made with red pepper jelly, chopped peppadews, and diced red onion. Great-tasting shawarma without a rotisserie.

- **Comment Body:** Double the onions! In my house there are never enough. If, however you have leftover onions they are amazing in an omelet for breakfast (or anytime). This became an immediate family favorite. I serve it with tahini sauce on the side instead of the white sauce. It's also great at room temp if you want it for a pot luck or company. Just make alot!

Cooked on high about 3 hours while we went to church, and then finished in the oven under the broiler to crisp up.  It worked!  Served with risotto, greek salad, feta, parsley and yogurt sauce.

- **Comment Body:** I didn't have time to marinate this at all, so I just dumped the meat, the marinade and the onions atop a sheet pan lined with non-stick foil and stuck it in the oven. The results were fabulous! I served it with rice, cucumbers, tomatoes, olives, garlic hummus, pita bread and tzatziki sauce. I could see that there was a lot of smoke in the oven, so I turned it off after I thought the chicken was done and let everything stay in the oven for about ten minutes until the smoke dissipated. Perfect!

- **Comment Body:** I’ve made this a couple of times now and like it a lot. I highly recommend using kitchen shears to cut up the chicken pieces rather than trying to do it with a knife: MUCH easier with shears.I marinate about 10 hours and the chicken seems to absorb almost all the marinade: very little free liquid at the end, and I just pour that over the chicken before I put it into the oven.

- **Comment Body:** I'd suggest using a mix of Meyer lemons and "regular" lemons for this one. You can bump up the flavor with a little more cumin, and I frequently use half smoked and half half-sharp paprika. My husband says this is the closest thing to shawarma that he's had since Lebanon, and my Israeli friends love it too! We serve this with laffa (AKA Trader Joe's  "Middle Eastern Flatbreads;" puff them on the grill first); marinated feta; muhammara; and Arabic salad. In very heavy rotation in my house.

It can dry out at that high heat if you cook it too long.

I crisped sliced pieces on the stove & it was perfect. Served with a white sauce (1/2 c greek yogurt, 2 tbsp mayo, 1/2 lemon juiced + zest, 2 cloves garlic grated on the microplane, chopped parsley and salt to taste), a tomato/cucumber/parsley/lemon salad, garlic naan, hot sauce, olives and stuffed grape leaves. Even the kids (3 & 6) loved it!

- **Comment Body:** Wow! Made last night, and it is terrific! Stuck to recipe except for onions-will cut onion(s) in quarters per recipe, think chicken needs that extra bite larger pieces deliver.  Served with warm pita, but I will serve with rice next time. (I found the pita to be too floury for the meat.) Not a big fan of cumin...but somehow the spice mixture becomes an amalgam of a delicious flavor with no one spice jumping out. Made white sauce (VG)-whole milk yogurt+mayo+lemon juice+garlic. Enjoyed by all!

I have also frozen the chicken in the marinade, I use less oil and sometimes add yogurt. When I am making the marinade I grate up an extra clove of garlic for the yogurt sauce. My chicken only takes about 20 minutes to cook. Cook on heavy duty aluminum foil and zero clean up. Thanks Sam!

We went on an outing and got back later than we thought and had stopped to eat so when I got home, I drained the marinade off the chicken and left it in the refrigerator until the next day at noon.  I roasted it.  The extra time did not seem to hurt it.  I turned the oven to 500 for the last 10 minutes and turned the meat over.  Both sides were crispy.  It was excellent.

Highly recommend cutting the chicken up after it’s baked and crisping it in a pan—it takes the chicken from good to great and gives it a true shawarma feel.   The spices in this are the perfect balance, and it pairs well with grilled naan, white/yogurt sauce, and cucumbers. Delicious and not too heavy.

The collagen and broth leads to a much juicier dish.   The cooking time on the recipe however was not altered. 30-40 minutes is for thighs with bone and skin.   Boneless skinless thighs cooking time is 20 minutes.

Great for a crowd with hummus, pita, Israeli chopped salad and a little harissa or schug.

Slice the onion into wedges (1cm or so) and toss with the marinade and chicken overnight. 3. Slice the chicken before marinating. Marinade coats more of the surface area of the chicken this way, and it gets a little more roasted and crispy. 4. When ready to cook, just dump it all onto a sheet pan with some parchment paper.

- **Comment Body:** This is an excellent home version of Shawarma. I marinated the chicken overnight and fried it, in stages, to brown it up after baking. This step was crucial to achieving the right texture. The white sauce was great and the toppings really made it a perfect dish.

I immediately headed for my NY Times recipes and found this one. I've made it quite a few times since seeing it here (including tonight). I've followed the recipe as written, except for using skinless, boneless chicken breasts. The taste is so delicious and unlike any other dish I've made. I'm rereading the comments to see what others have paired with it.

Same temp and time, more or less. It made something deliciously between shawarma and stew, with that same marinade flavor, just a lot more of it.

Unless you're cooking up an old hen, modern chicken doesn't need to be tenderized, which is what marinades are for. I'm convinced less time will make this an even better dish.

I didn't have turmeric, so I swapped for 1/4 tsp ginger and 1/4 tsp curry powder (I thought 1/2 tsp of either would have too pungent an effect). The marinade was delicious. Served it with harissa spiced potatoes, which I roasted in the oven alongside the chicken, and sautéed green beans.

Next time, I'll use boneless and cut the pieces into smaller chunks, maybe each thigh into two pieces. The marinade just doesn't penetrate the larger pieces enough. Other than that, very good.

Baked on a rack over a sheet pan and the meat browns and chars beautifully! Used boneless, skinless chicken breasts halved horizontally and watched closely so as not to overcook. 25 minutes did it. Plan to double the onions next time. And there will be a next time!

When removing meat and onion from the marinade, try to have as little of the marinade as possible accompanying it onto the sheet pan.  Two sheet pans are best if using 3 lbs. of chicken.

If you have trouble with heartburn (like I do), apple cider vinegar instead of the lemon juice works great. I used 4 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar to replace the lemon juice and notice no difference in taste. Great for Greek pita pockets, atop a Greek-style salad, in Greek rice bowls or by itself. My boyfriend especially loves the bowls version. Enjoy!

As suggested I increased the amount of onions and added bell peppers which I would recommend.

I'd never substitute breast meat for the thighs - they'd turn out dry and definitely less flavorful.

Other than reducing it to suit my 20oz package of chicken thighs, I followed the recipe almost exactly, but substituted cayenne for the red pepper flakes and a large yellow onion for the red. Chicken was marinated for about 8 hours. I added strips of red pepper per other reviewer's suggestions. Served with the suggested yogurt/mayo/lemon/garlic white sauce kicked up with some sriracha.

- **Comment Body:** This recipe surpasses Nigella's coriander based one. The one nit I'd pick is that Sam's suggestion of cutting some mayo into yogurt wasn't as rewarding as I'd hoped (I love mayo). I'd consider sprinkling some sumac and cutting in garlic into yogurt instead all'Ottolenghi. Also, good flat bread or at least very fresh pita bread is essential. Cucumbers for crunch. I added cilantro and parsley. Next time I'll try some pickles and radish.

- **Comment Body:** I loved this recipe and will be making it for a Xmas eve dinner with lots of goodies on the side (cukes, olives, feta, roasted veggies, olives, hummus...). There is a lot of extra liquid, but it's great drizzled on rice, or the naan/pita bread.I loved the roasted but moist texture of the chicken. It was a crowd pleaser for sure! Also mixed some plain yogurt with sour cream (can spin of from that for sure!) as a topping. DELISH!

Made this again with Maureen Abood's tweaks (sumac & cinnamon subbed for the cumin/turmeric/paprika; broil 3 minutes after chopping to finish instead of pan fry) and that was great as well.

- **Comment Body:** we have this in regular rotation and it's LOVED by all!we've settled on the following routine:- serve as a kind of gyro/wrap- up the amount of onions and separate them, spreading them around the pan, so that they end up caramelizing (yum!)- let more marinade stay on the chicken before it goes in the oven resulting in very moist chicken- tear apart the meat rather than slice it making it look a bit more gyro-esque- the kids love canned corn as a condiment

- **Comment Body:** WOW fantastic recipe.  I reduced both the black pepper and olive oil by half and added an extra onion  No other changes.  White Sauce is essential.  Even my partner who isn't keen on raw garlic said the white sauce really makes the dish.  1/2 cup plain yogurt, 1/4 cup mayo, juice of half a lemon, 1 garlic clove smashed and minced fine.  Served this with rice pilaf and Israeli Salad (tomato, cucumber, and cubanelle pepper chopped in very small dice, dressed with olive oil and lemon juice).

Served on naan, because I like the taste better than pitas.  Made up my own sauce from hummus, yogurt and a touch of mayo and lemon. Delicious.  We had some leftover.

Two pounds of carrots, which I toss in the marinade and roast with the extra red onion. An astonishing recipe!

- **Comment Body:** This is a staple in our house. But this week I used already cooked/grilled chicken breasts that were sort of bland. Marinated them for four hours or so and then, since they were already cooked, I just put them in a pan and crisped the chicken up. Amazing! Tasted as good as if I had made them starting with raw chicken.

- **Comment Body:** I’ve made this several times.  As written and with bone-in skin-on thighs.  While they are both really good, we much prefer the bone in version. Make a small slit in each side of the thigh bone and rub in the marinade and place a spoonful  under the skin so that the meat is in  contact with the seasonings.   A bit more effort but totally worth it Especially if you need to hold the dish.

When time is short, I shortcut by marinating the chicken in a 9x13" Pyrex and then just roasting it in there as well- no separate pan. It obviously doesn't get as crisp, but it's still delicious and I save a pan or two of washing.

I made my own tzatziki sauce thanks to one of the comments below. I bought some tahini from Trader Joe's; added some harissa and hummus as additional sauces to swath on the whole wheat pita bread. I sliced up some cucumber and tomatoes to add to the color. I also accompanied it with a chickpea salad and potatoes roasted with rosemary. It was a hit.

I have been doubling the recipe and freezing in ziplock bags and the whole family loves it. I'm still working on an authentic garlic sauce (toum) recipe to go with it. Wish NY TIMES had one!

- **Comment Body:** This is recipe is delicious and foolproof. I make it several times a month, sometimes twice in a week. And I always have a few packets of chicken thighs marinated in the freezer ready to go. I often end up cooking the meat on a ridged grill pan on the stove top. Grill, slice and grill a little more. I've made it on the backyard grill, too. Sometimes, I toss in some sweet or bell peppers. It's perfect every time, whether in a pita, a wrap or a salad.

- **Comment Body:** I was also able to make this with GROUND TURKEY!  Rather than baking chicken, I stir-fried one pound of 93% lean ground turkey with the spices in the recipe, and added the juice of ONE lemon rather than two.  It's delicious and the flavors are all still there.  That, and it's much quicker than using chicken!

- **Comment Body:** I made this for dinner tonight. The chicken was in the marinade for 6 hrs. My tiny tweaks: I microplaned the zest from the lemon before juicing them and added it to the marinade; I figured- why waste the flavor? I left out the cinnamon, and used 2 large onions to roast w/the meat. Served with a salad of English cuke, grape tomatoes, feta, oregano; tossed in a garlicky vinaigrette. Flat bread, roasted carrots, and yogurt filled out the plate. Delicious!

- **Comment Body:** Trim eggplant and cut it into long slices. Salt the slices and let them sit for 20 minutes or so, then pat them dry. Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towel and place a wire rack on top. In a large, deep skillet, heat 1/2 cup oil until a drop of water flicked into pan sizzles. Working in batches, fry eggplant until just tender, 20 to 30 seconds per side. Transfer fried eggplant to rack to drain. Nice with shawarma!

- **Comment Body:** More praise! This is a family favorite for us - at least twice a month! Make it to the letter - so easy and it comes out perfect! That said, I use more chicken thighs (the three of us can nearly finish off the recipe as is and we want leftovers). More onions - yes! They are so tasty. I stick the pan in while the oven finishes pre-heating for the 40 minutes, then take it out, cut it up, and stick it back in for another 5 to 10 minutes. The edges get a bit crispy - so good! Also good with rice!

I recently made it using 8 pounds of chicken thighs. The only changes I made were to halve the amount of olive oil, use more garlic, and add more red onions. I have not not tried crisping the chicken but it is delicious as is.

- **Comment Body:** This recipe is really, really great (shows up on both my and my 18-year-old son's "best ever" lists).  I LOVE this stuff!! My only suggestion:  cut the oil in half.  I currently make this, halved; for one person (me, living alone; dinner and maybe 2 additional lunches).  But although I use all other ingredients cut in half, I cut the oil by 4 (e.g for 1 lb of chicken thighs, 2 Tbsp of olive oil is plenty).

- **Comment Body:** Keep the sauce! If you must have crispy chicken, please read no further, but all others please try cooking the chicken & onions in the delicious sauce, instead of discarding as marinade. Spoon it all over rice, or serve with bread to sop-up the glorious sauce. No, it’s not shawarma, but neither is the original recipe (don’t tell Sam!) and the sauce is so delicious.  This also works beautifully with tofu. Cook the sauce & onions for 10 minutes in a pan, then add sliced firm tofu for add'l 10 min.

- **Comment Body:** Firstly, I love this dish - easy, delish, etc. A couple things I did different, if you are interested: 1.  I add the spices and lemon juice and let sit for about 15 minutes before I add the olive oil.  This allows the citric acid to break down the spices and release more flavor. 2.  I added cauliflower florets along with the onion when baking and that turned out well....now I'm thinking maybe bell peppers too....

Brought it to a boil (was thinking of the raw chicken that had spent a few hours in it), added about 2tsp or so brown sugar before adding the quartered sprouts. Coated and sauteed, then braised. Finished with a couple tbsp soy sauce. Yum. The chicken is fab, and the marinade worth saving for another use!

Both of my ovens have malfunctioned, so I cooked the chicken in a grill pan. Didn't have the proper ingredients for the sides but made lemon rice and a bright salad with chickpeas, tomatoes, onions, parsley with lemon/olive oil dressing. It was outstanding. I'm going to make flat breads today so that I can have sandwiches.

### Recipe: Oven-Roasted Chicken Shawarma

- **User Display Name:** Lucas
- **Comment Body:** Really good recipe! We've made it dozens of times and turns out great every time. The changes I would suggest is keep the same amount of marinade but use at least 3-4 lbs of chicken and 2 red onions instead of one, it goes really fast!  A quick and easy tzatziki-ish sauce to make with it is: 1 cup Greek Yogurt, 2 Tbsp Lemon Juice, 2 cloves garlic, 1/2 tsp Salt, 1 Cup Cucumber, 4 Tbsp Cilantro Goes great with rice, Shirazi Salad, or Pita wraps

- **Comment Body:** I am a little confused: after marinating the chicken and placing it on the sheet pan, you do not spread the remaining marinade over the chicken. Correct? In roasting the chicken, it produced quite a bit of juice and was certainly not 'crispy'. Also, why is the onion only cut in quarters?

- **Comment Body:** This has been my go-to brownie recipe for 30 years, even after going to baking school! I agree that using the best cocoa possible makes a difference. These days, I use Callebaut. In the 80s, an acquaintence in Germany to whom I brought some of the brownies, and who considered herself a great cook, asked for the recipe but was never able to get it to work. She kept asking me what she was doing wrong and I was never able to solve her problem. Eventually, she moved to the US and stole my husband!

I also cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup.  I make sure to use the full cup of walnuts, and even those who don't like nuts in brownies, love these.  Have to watch when the brownies are in the oven, particularly when using a square glass Pyrex pan, because they cook more quickly.  As soon as you smell them, they are nearly done!

Cut the butter into small pieces to melt faster at low temperature.  It is actually faster than waiting for hot over-heated fat to cool!

If you're using an 8 X 8, double the recipe.  Otherwise they are pretty thin.  2.  This is particularly true because I skip the nuts.  3.  When I melt the butter and cocoa, I add 1/4 cup chocolate chips.  4.  After several tries, I've found that you can cut the sugar in half.  Way more chocolate as opposed to sugar flavor.

Grease it with butter.  Once the brownies are done and cool (and they will firm up a little as they cool) simply lift out the foil and use a pizza cutter or long sharp chef's knife to cut the brownies into squares.

This solved two problems - the butter melts properly and slowly in the oven and cools faster when transferred to a room temperature bowl, and secondly, it coats your baking pan for non stick cooking.

Omitted nuts, added 1/4 tsp. salt, 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper, 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon, 1 tsp. finely powdered espresso. This doesn't taste spicy, they just "wake up" the chocolate flavor. When baking nearly done, I sprinkled a thin layer of mini-chips on top, let soften, and spread them over entire cake.

Increase your yield by using a rubber spatula to get every drop of batter into the pan. And make sure to wait until the brownies are cool before removing them from the pan or else you just end up with goo that you need to reform into actual brownies, which is, however, possible.

- **Comment Body:** In response to Chef Z, that may be true of some recipes not intended for home cooks, but if you grew up baking at home in the US, the opposite is true. Assume salted butter unless unsalted is specified. Salted butter is the kind typically found in American households and recipes have been written with this assumption for decades. For this recipe and the context and era in which it was written, I would assume salted butter.

I'm not sure high-quality cocoa makes a difference -- I used plain old Hersey's every time -- but European butter makes a HUGE difference. Kerrygold butter baked for 35 minutes and they were perfect (at 30 mins, they will be gooey and messy to cut). American butter makes them significantly drier.

- **Comment Body:** This was not a great recipe -- I followed the instructions to letter, even letting the butter and cocoa to "cool for a few minutes."I was expecting a thick, rich, fudgey browning but they were think and over-cooked.  Doing some research online, I found that the same version of the recipe added the sugar to the melted butter and cocoa after cooling but before adding the eggs and the vanilla.  Makes much more sense given that sugar is considered a liquid ingredient in baking.

- **Comment Body:** Because of the low flour content resulting in a fudgey batter, this brownie is more dense and therefore, thinner. most brownie recipes do not require a levening agent, which is the biggest distincation between brownies and cakes.  the baking powder was not inadvertently left out of this recipe, adding baking powder would undesirably and drastically change the texture of the brownie!

Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Melt 2 squares unsweetened chocolate and 1/4 pound butter over very low heat in a heavy saucepan. Remove from heat and stir in 1 cup granulated sugar. Beat in 2 eggs and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. Quickly stir in 1 cup chopped walnuts, 1/4 cup all-purpose flour and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Spread batter in a well-greased 8x8 inc

- **Comment Body:** Bake it like Kate: Food & Wine published this recipe in a dessert book published in the late '80s. They left the method in Miss Hepburn's original rendition. Step 1 calls for the eggs and vanilla to be added to the melted cocoa/butter mixture, and then you "beat it all like mad." This you must do with perfect posture and cheeks sucked in, of course.

- **Comment Body:** A Trick to removing them -- Line pan with foil. Turn pan over & press foil around sides and bottom.  Remove foil from outside and reinsert it to pan, pressing into corners.  Use a potholder or paper towel to press into corners (so as to not tear foil).  Spray or butter as usual.When cooled and set, just lift the foil.  Et voila.  I freeze mine, but that's a cosmetic thing.  It keeps the brownies moister longer after defrosting b/c there's no evaporation during cooling.

- **Comment Body:** I don't get all the fuss about salted versus unsalted butter.  Salted butter actually has very little salt in it.  Salt enhances flavor, and I'm guessing that it was added to preserve butter pre-frigeration.  In fact, many unsalted butters have "natural flavorings" added!  Really? If you're worried about it, omit the "pinch" of salt called for in the recipe if using salted butter.

- **Comment Body:** I made a few tweaks to this recipe: 1) brown the butter 2) whip the eggs for half a minute for fluffier brownies and 3) instead of cocoa powder use 2 ounces of bittersweet (or unsweetened) high quality baking chocolate that you melt into the butter after browning. I prefer a dark not overly sweet brownie. Also found that my local creamery butter has a lot of fat in it and made the brownies too moist--standard unsalted butter from the store works better.

I used parchment paper for easy clean up(this step actually was the most difficult lol). THANKS FOR THE HELPFUL TIPS.  BROWNIES CAME OUT GREAT!!!

- **Comment Body:** My new go-to brownie recipe. Other reviewers described these as gooey, which is not what I'm looking for in a brownie. I used 1/2 tsp salt and bread flour, because I'm a sweet-salty, "chewy" brownie girl. Loved them. Dark, rich, and fudgy. Despite the 1c sugar, they were perfectly sweet. Very easy to make with ingredients that are readily available in the house. Definitely let them cool completely, so they don't fall apart, and line the pan with aluminum foil for easy removal.

- **Comment Body:** I adored Hepburn and copied this recipe from an article interviewing her back in the late 50s, and from her mouth to your ears, here is what she gave as her recipe: she used dark bitter baking chocolate, not cocoa. She mixed the entire batter in the actual pan in which she melted the chocolate. She didn't fool with an extra bowl. Maybe using cocoa is better, but I've never tried it because the original recipe is so very good. I just think it should be mentioned as a "version" of her recipe.

If you remove them onto a large enough cutting surface, and invert the pan, your brownies will come out easily, with parchment paper now on top. C-A-R-E-F-U-L-L-Y remove the parchment paper and cut the brownies into squares, using a sharp knife, dipping the knife in a glass or other container of ice water, after each slice. Good luck!

And to be honest some self acclaimed foodies think they are too rich. Phooey.When you find them and try one batch, go back to the store and buy 4 packs for your freezer.

The cayenne gave the brownies a more adult, slightly kicky, Mexican chocolate flavor, while cutting the sweetness a tad and popping the chocolate. Delicious!  Cayenne also boosts your metabolism.

I used glass 8x8 so I cut the temp to 315 and time ended up being 27 min (I stop baking when the center just stops wiggling with shaking). These brownies are AMAZING. I became instantly addicted to them unlike any store mix brownies. They were perfect. I have to think those complaining about these brownies did something wrong.

- **Comment Body:** As others have suggested, I used less sugar and more flour, just mounding the measuring cup and more cocoa powder. I used a whole cup of chopped pecans, toasting them first in the microwave. If you don't like or can't eat nuts use another recipe, this one needs them!  Parchment paper is an excellent tip! I love gooey brownies and these are yummy.

Marion Cunningham totally ruins it in her revision of Fannie Farmer "for the nineties" (p. 628). You don't need cocoa. Two ounces of baking chocolate also works perfectly.

- **Comment Body:** Wow!  Just made these for the first time yesterday and they are AMAZING! I cooked for 30 minutes but the brownies really don’t hold their form when cutting and serving - will go closer to 35 min next time.  Also, I followed the recipe as instructed but maybe next time I would do 80% of the required sugar to take the sweetness down a bit.  Regardless, for how simple these were to make and how delicious they are, I don’t think I’ll ever make a box brownie again.

- **Comment Body:** Not impressed with these. I think that the sugar needs to be beat into the egg mixture rather than just stirred in with the flour. I also think there should be at least a 1/4 tsp of baking powder in these so that they don't come out so flat -- and caveat, I do like fudgy brownies, not cakey. I also did add 1/2 tsp of sea salt which is just a personal preference for baked goods. I think that these brownies have great flavor but that there are better brownie recipes out there.

Whisk eggs and sugar until foamy, then whisk in butter and vanilla, then stir in dry mixture. Mix in walnuts and 3 oz bittersweet couverture chocolate discs per batch. Pour in pan and sprinkle 2 tbs cacao nibs on top. Bake double batch in 8" x 8" pan for extra thick brownies and sprinkle with Maldon salt near end of baking time. Done when moist crumbs cling to toothpick (not clean).

The house smelled amazing, and I couldn't resist, but ended up handing my husband a plate of broken bits and pieces of amazingly delicious, rich, decadent brownie. Be patient, and let them cool entirely, maybe even in the refrigerator. A wide strip of parchment paper in the pan to assist in lifting the brownies out of the pan after baking might also be helpful.

The only thing I did differently was use salted butter (Kerrygold is my favorite) and omit the pinch of salt.  The least delicious version was my initial one, wherein I doubled the recipe, added 1/4 of baking powder, used high quality dutch cocoa, and sprinkled the walnuts on top.  I should have just listened to Kate the first time!  :)

- **Comment Body:** I don't know if you or someone you know shops at Costco but they usually have one brand or another of good, organic cocoa. Anything they have will be 1000 times better than Hershey (and most likely the same price for twice as much) and also more ethically sourced. I've been using the one I got there and it was great. Natural food stores usually have very good bulk organic cocoa that is typically not more than the price of Hershey's.

Cold pressed cacao beans produce an amazing cocoa with an almost fruity flavor. Its also tremendously more healthy than run of the mill heat pressed cocoa, with tons of super healthy phytonutrients.

- **Comment Body:** If you have problem with extra-gooey/moist brownies when it comes time to cut them into squares, these tips might help. First, despite brownies being so yummy while still warm, hold back the urge to cut them before they've cooled. I use a pizza cutter which I dip into ice water between slicing. You'll get a few crumbs when the cutter is removed, but take "cook's privilege" and eat the crumb(s) yourself!

- **Comment Body:** Made these during our family pandemic time together and wow! Didn’t have the proper size pan so used a cupcake tin and the proportions for 12 were perfect. Need to really spray or butter the tin before filling. Used kosher salt but otherwise mirrored the recipe. Will surely put in the rotation going forward.

- **Comment Body:** I consider myself a skilled home chef and have made these a dozen times. Despite studying what went wrong after each of the failed attempts, I realized that they are not my style of brownie. They taste bitter and springy instead of caramelized and rich. Use Mark Bittman's recipe instead if you like a crunchy exterior and gooey interior.

- **Comment Body:** I used to bake a lot as a kid but only do it occasionally now. There was a time when recipes said to use cocoa powder OR baking chocolate, but then recipes began to take sides. Whether Hepburn made a choice and then changed or someone else did it, my guess is that if you use good chocolate or good cocoa (I used Penzeys), these will turn out rich and tasty. I'm not a huge fan of nuts in brownies, but they really work here. I did the "beat like mad" method of combining which I suspect works best.

If the batter is too hot you will cook the eggs and the brownies will not rise or set up correctly when baked.  Use good cocoa, not Dutch. I use Penzey. Mound the cocoa measurement a little and underfill the sugar a bit. Toast the nuts, preferably pecans. Throw in a couple more pinches of salt, and 1/8 tsp of espresso powder. Easy and a

I used a mixed cup of cashews, pistachios, and sliced almonds instead of walnuts/pecans because it’s what I had (I started making the brownies confident I had one of them because I usually do) and the result is GREAT. Makes it flexible, something you can easily whip up with stuff you have on hand. ❤️

I do this with many other chocolate recipes so wanted to try it out.  Had used unsalted butter as I wasn’t sure what it called for, so after the pinch of salt in the batter I still sprinkled the top lightly with maldon.  The crunchy salty bits were amazing so would totally have used a little more on top!

It’s a dense brownie (good!) but didn’t develop a crispy top & the finished product tasted almost like I was just eating the batter.   If I make again I would probably add espresso grinds and 1/8 teaspoon of baking soda

Add 3/4 cup sugar to mixture. This cools it further before you beat in eggs. In separate bowl, add 1/4 cup flour, 1/2 cup pecans, 1/4-1/2 cup chocolate chips, pinch of salt. Mix until all covered in flour. Add to pan with butter mixture, mix just until incorporated, put in 8x8 baking pan (essential!), bake for 20 mins. Let cool.

Also followed the tip to add 1 tsp of espresso powder.  Finally, I baked in an 8 x 8 pan and sliced into 16 pieces.  For me, this was perfect size-- after all, brownies are treat not a meal replacement.  Thanks for all of the tips!

Because I was baking for someone who can’t have gluten, I used King Arthur’s 1 to 1 gluten free baking flour mix. I had pecans on hand, so I used those instead of walnuts.  The result were the BEST brownies I have ever made or had. You would never know they were gluten free. I’m making again with regular flour for friends this weekend!

I otherwise followed the recipe line-by-line and they came out delicious.  I recommend cooling the brownies for AGES before cutting. 2 hours at least. At one hour post-bake they were overly gooey. Two hours post-bake they were fudgier and the consistency was noticeably better.

- **Comment Body:** Caramelized onions freeze well. After I harvest onions in the early fall, I set up a table next to my gas grill. I put a big skillet on the side burner, add some oil. I cut up three pounds of so at a time and toss them in the skillet.  Doing it on a breezy day keep the tears and smell at bay. After several batches, I let the caramelized onions cool and fill snack size Ziploc bags. Three bags fit into a quart freezer bag. They keep all winter.

- **Comment Body:** Made these with homemade tomato soup and thought they were great. We had leftovers, so I made myself another soup and sandwich, but added some minced fresh dates to the onion and heated them again in a little butter.   Wow! The very slight bitterness of onions was transformed. The added specs of sweetness to the combination of crisp bread, silky melted cheese and savory onions elevated this already excellent sandwich to something REALLY special.   Give it a try.  You’ll like it.

- **Comment Body:** As Natalie notes, getting the water out is essential for caramelization. One trick I learnt from another commenter on another recipe is to spread your sliced onions on a plate, cover with a paper towel, and zap in the microwave for two minutes. Doing so takes some of the moisture out of the onions and reduces the time needed for caramelizing.

Deglazing the pan with sherry vinegar took this dish over the top, as did some leftover Emmi Roth Le Maréchal cheese. Genuine comfort food, and easy to make, too. I can easily imagine making this on a weeknight. Whole Foods' "bits and pieces" of leftover ends of cheese make it possible to purchase just a small bit of some really interesting cheese.

- **Comment Body:** I make my carmelized onions in my Instant Pot. It takes about the same time as using a skillet, but it doesn’t have to be watched and stirred. I put 1-2T each of butter and olive oil in pot on sauté, add 2-3 lbs sliced onions and sauté until onions are coated, the pressure cook for 25 minutes. Quick release then sauté again until liquid has evaporated (5 min+-) and the onions are golden. No burning and very easy.

- **Comment Body:** I live in Russia and real Gruyere is hard to find and crazy expensive here, so I used some not so fancy cheese and common onions (we don't have varieties sold at stores) — still turned out super delicious and super French. It's amazing how 20 minutes of cooking in butter can transform the texture of onions and make them a sophisticated dish.

- **Comment Body:** My husband grills the bread slices on both sides on a buttered griddle first, then adds the cheese to one and puts the second slice on top of the first. This way the bread is good and crispy outside and inside but still moist inside (don’t overdo it). We also add different types of cheese. Best GC I’ve ever eaten!

I reduced the onions by almost half, and I deglazed the pan with dry sherry (adds a lot of depth to the sandwich). I'd make this again. The one thing I have to perfect is getting all the cheese inside the sandwich melty. Anyone tried covering the pan to get all the cheese to melt before the bread gets too dark, or would that take some crispiness away from the toasted bread?

Make sure you have enough cheese, maybe a bit more than in the recipe.  Used Mayo for toasting, gives a crisp, but tender crust.  Also used a Trader Joe’s sliced ciabatta.  It’s like a bowl of French onion soup in a sandwich!  Worth caramelizing onions ( which I did overnight in my slow cooker)!

(Looking forward to trying with gruyere when we’re shopping again!) One note: I was using regular sized sandwich bread. I doubled the recipe as I was feeding four people, and the filling made 6-7 sandwiches. Next time I’ll probably just make the single batch of filling for four regular-sized sandwiches.

The first time I made this, a lot of onion and cheese fell out when I flipped the sandwiches. After that I decided to just grill the individual slices of buttered bread, with cheese on half the slices. I spoon the onions (reheated—I caramelize them in advance) on top of the cheese and then add the top slice.

Used a different stronger type cheese and it was delicious. I never thought of grating the cheese. Good tip.

Carmelize the onions until they’re a deep golden brown and add generous splashes of red wine along with beef Broth. Then just cut up some French bread and toast it in the oven, pour the onion soup into a crock and top with the toasted French bread smothered in shredded Gruyere. A few seconds under the broiler and you’ve got a taste of heaven.

First of all, I definitely use less oil. We also add a pinch of cumin and we leave half the peel of the cucumber on for better digestion. Last, we add the white center of days-old bread (a third or half of a French baguette-like) soaked in vinager, to the blender. The bread makes it really creamy, great use of old bread!

I learned by experience.The first time, it seemed so nicely liquified, using the Vitamix, that I served it as was, seemingly delicious.The second time I strained it and the soup was transformed. The flavors so precise, unusual in purity, they required no garnish, no drizzle, no crouton. The guests were in unanimous agreement on this point.Other notes: go a bit shy with the sherry vinegar and salt, you can add more later if needed. A little goes a long way.

A few things -Smaller, sweeter varieties of tomato are usually better (juicy, not meaty...no beefsteak for example). -Flash boil the tomatoes to peel them (along with coring them) and you'll save yourself the step of straining, which some people say takes away from the flavor. -Remove the germ from your garlic, or you'll be tasting it all night. -The part about chilling at least 6 hours is bologna.. just chill till cold or stir in ice cubes.

- **Comment Body:** Great recipe and very authentic to what I enjoyed in Barcelona.  After rough chopping the vegetables (and by the way I prefer without the onion), I salt and leave for about an hour.  This develops a ton more flavour.  Then puree, making sure to add oil very slowly for a good emulsification.  Finally I reserve small amount of the vegetables to fine chop and add at the end for a bit of texture (only if you're going to eat from a bowl rather than drink from a glass).

I use a deep red bell pepper when I make it in the early summer, to sweeten the taste, when the tomatoes are still not fully ripened.

- **Comment Body:** I've made this recipe several times, and it seems to separate whenever the tomatoes, onion and/or cucumber are especially juicy. The thing to do, especially when working with ripe ingredients, is to add the olive oil in step 2 very, very slowly, making sure it fully emulsifies before adding more. On the other hand, if the gazpacho separates in the fridge, just give it a good stir with a wooden spoon before serving. It's still just as delicious (and nobody is any the wiser!).

Once (emergency) I made it at 6 pm, put it in a metal bowl in the freezer, stirred twice, and enjoyed it an hour later (after stirring well to melt and incorporate the tiny frozen bits).Also, if your tomatoes are not perfectly ripe and flavorsome, you can cheat by adding a bit of high quality tomato paste. Straining makes this exceptionally lovely on the tongue.

- **Comment Body:** I never liked gazpacho until we made this today from the first to ripen of our bumper crop of tomatoes. I could live on it, and might, expecting radiant health and a welcome weight loss (except on days I add vodka to it). Made exactly as written, using a Vidalia onion, cubanelle pepper and finishing it by liquefying in a standing blender. I prefer to drink it, and wouldn't add bread, which would dilute the pure and perfectly balanced vegetable flavors, and make it heavy. Thank you, Julia!

I guess it's true that everyone has their favorite way to do this--I was craving something a bit more substantial. The sherry vinegar is a really wonderful addition that I hadn't explored previously and the olive oil, as she notes, is KEY.

Also, it is often served with a dish of finely chopped white onion, peppers and tomatoes to garnish with a splash of olive oil and red wine vinegar.

- **Comment Body:** I have prepared gazpacho many times and also made this version. Spaniards don't use the onion. Most cooks in Spain put 3-4 cloves of garlic. And I would add 1/2 to 3/4 C water. Adding the olive oil in a stream emulsifies the gazpacho. And straining is the great secret for a creamy consistency. I use a French strainer or food mill, the one that has a handle that turns. It gets most of the juices of the vegetables and some pulp too. In any case, this gazpacho without bread is superb!

The difference is how long you blend the ingredients -- at least 3 minutes on high before adding olive oil, vinegar etc, and then giving it another minute. The texture is absolutely velvety.

My friend who has lived in Spain off and on for almost 50 years said this was the best gazpacho she's ever tasted.

- **Comment Body:** Read an online article about straining the tomatoes to remove the seeds, which (article said) add bitterness. Bought 750 grams of strained tomatoes, added 1 seeded cuke, 1 red onion, 1 bunch cilantro, 1 jalapeño, 1 orange pepper, 1 garlic clove. Blended all; added water. Put in frigo. Till tomorrow AM . . . In France I bought a litre of "gazpacho" (Spanish brand) in a supermarket, drank it every morning, and didn't want to come back to USA.

- **User Display Name:** Joyce Miller
- **Comment Body:** Suggested by a friend Gina Ganter to make the following alterations: half the onion, and only white onion; add two peaches; peel cucumbers, tomatoes, and peaches. Use food processor or blender to make everything as fine as possible, and do not filter out solids; use less olive oil (like 1/3 cup max), or to taste.

- **Comment Body:** I've probably made this gazpacho 20 times. It always delivers. Sometimes I've strained it, other times not--using a Vitamix ensures there are no clumps and the last time I prepared it a strainer did not do anything.   How hot the poblano is makes a difference. If it's hot, I would go light on it, especially if the gazpacho will be served one or two days later, by which time the heat of the pepper will have infused it much more.

It required two drained 28 oz cans of peeled San Marzano tomatoes to yield two pounds. Otherwise followed the recipe as written with Anaheim peppers, and it has been well received.

The avocado mellows the onion, garlic and salt so I used a little more of each and it was perfect. Straining and chilling are a must and this tastes even better the next day.

Once the summer garden's tomatoes start piling up, this stays as a constant in the fridge.  My first batch, I couldn't locate sherry vinegar ANYwhere, so I used white wine vinegar and added a splash of sherry. I liked it so much I went back to doing it that way on my subsequent batches!

I  first used my food processor to blend the veggies in 2 batches and then transferred the blended veggies to the blender where they all fit, and added the vinegar and oil. I was skeptical at first because I'm a fan of chunky gazpacho, but this might be my new favorite! It was a big hit at the picnic. I was also thinking that it might make a really good bloody Mary! :-)

To accommodate his preference, I serve this with some chopped up veggies on the side for him to add.

Never have I ever added onion to a gazpacho.  I am open to try the recipe with cubanelle instead of red bell peppers, but never ever with onion.   I make it with or without bread,  depending on the paleo status of my home, though.

The key to straining is passing through enough fiber for body, but not peels and seeds.  So don't over blend.  Alternative, use a freshly roasted red pepper instead of green.  Make a day ahead, then re-adjust vinegar for best results.

Chilling overnight will greatly improve the flavor! Serve in a bowl with a garnish of diced tomatoes, peppers, onions and a splash of olive oil! WOW!

I used green/spring onions rather than an onion b/c that’s what I had. The only peppers available in the nearby grocer’s were, I think, finger peppers. They worked fine, not too hot. Otherwise I made as written. To enter into the straining debate, I say strain! It changes the texture of the soup and strains out the cucumber and tomato seeds. Yum!

Make sure to blend or stir it well before serving, because the solids will rise to the top after about 15 minutes.

Chop tomatoes, lightly salt, let macerate at room temp. for a couple of hours to really develop the flavor. Then follow rest of Step 1 3. Strain mixture *before* adding EVOO 4. I over-acidulated a bit so it was balanced when served with glugs of really good EVOO and a sprinkle of chives  This stuff is like silk made of tomatoes. Yum!

I’m starting with 3 lbs of tomatoes these days and half the onion. Careful with that garlic. A jalapeño for heat and a red bell pepper for color. I like a dry sherry and rice vinegar. A teaspoon of Old Bay in every batch. Fresh basil and mint, Mexican if you are lucky enough to find it. I have to try this with day old bread soaked in vinegar.

It’s brilliant as written, but after making about 20 quarts, I’ve found that adding a banana pepper adds a balanced heat that takes it over the top, heightening all the other flavors. In addition, both red and white onions were harsh to my taste, but a sweet yellow onion is perfect. Smooth gazpacho freezes perfectly, so if you have abundant tomatoes, make as much as your freezer will hold.

I also did not strain it. I used a little more sherry vinegar then called for and it was delicious

- **Comment Body:** This is perfect. It’s why I look forward to each summer. I use Roma tomatoes and a few small Persian cucumbers. It’s delightful, refreshing, and easy.  I’ve had many different versions of gazpacho while traveling in Spain, so I think it’s not useful or credible to critique this soup on the basis of its authenticity.

- **Comment Body:** After making over 25 batches just this summer, I find the recipe’s flawless. A couple of tweaks today might be helpful to others. Since this week’s tomatoes lacked the rich taste of heirlooms used before, I added 1t sugar and it did the trick. And I had excellent corn tortillas at hand, so tried adding one and found it added subtle complexity. Eight delicious batches now ready to share.

- **Comment Body:** This is my go-to gazpacho recipe and I always deviate slightly. Today I used a variety of heirloom tomatoes. I made 2 batches and found red/yellow heirlooms to have a more interesting flavor than a mix with green. Also only did half of a large cucumber, and added one jalapeño as well. Red wine vinegar works great, but only needed one tbs. Blend until smooth with garlic and an Anaheim pepper. I store the soup in jars and always serve cold w/ a drizzle of evoo and a dash of good salt & pepper. Yum

- **Comment Body:** Having grown up in Andalucía I will share two secrets of home cooking. 1 - Use potato chips to make your tortilla.   As endorsed by Ferran Adrià: because who wants to be frying potatoes in 95F temperatures. 2 - Use a good quality tomato juice (we find Campbell's is best) rather than trying to make your own from tomatoes in a blender.  By the way, this is not a very good recipe for gazpacho. It is missing the essential ingredient of soaked bread, there are no almonds, or enough garlic.

- **Comment Body:** I live in the South Pacific and summer (all year round in fact) is the perfect time for gazpacho. But I like it chunky and dairy free with the addition of celery, green pepper (capsicum) and carrot. I'm occasionally tempted to add boiled beetroot too - and I use apple cider vinegar. Basically I make it from whatever I have in the fridge and as long as it turns out cold, salty, chunky and  tangy - I'm one happy beach bum in my surfside shack on the Coral Sea.

Were I to make Julia's again, I would dial back the sherry vinegar to one teaspoon and go with a still smaller onion. Or perhaps the tomatoes weren't at the peak of their flavor; I have an aversion to emulsifing pick of the season tomatoes when I could simply slice them and enjoy them in their native form.

- **Comment Body:** The best way, Andalusian style, that's where I am from, is to peel the tomatoes before, either with a special fine tomato peeler, or by scalding the tomato in boiling water. That way you can just blend it and you don't need to strain it afterwards. I make a ton of it every week with juicy heirloom tomatoes and keep it in a jug and drink it out of a water glass, Spanish style.

I've never found a green pepper that didn't overwhelm taste though, so I stick to red. Have never bothered straining.  Alternate gazpacho all summer long with salmorejo, which I also adore.

I put all in a blender and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (the longer the better). If my tomatoes aren't ripe enough I add a couple of tablespoons of roasted tomato paste. The best part s the optional garnish-fresh croutons, and dice - cherry tomatoes, cucumber, red onion or shallot. Let your guests add their choice. Adding fresh crabmeat is fantastic!

Not as beautiful as in the picture but I assure you tasted much better than the picture. May not get to try it with the add-ins as it is almost all gone.

I chop up the biggest parts for a few seconds to make room, then it add the rest.  Let it run for 4 or 5 minutes, adding the vinegar and oil through the feed tube toward the end, and you are done.  This way, there are no solids to drain, they are completely chopped up.

Keep bread on hand, in case you reach the same conclusion.   Finally, I would use half a clove of garlic next time.  Oops, one more--adding solids in the end, worked well.

- **Comment Body:** Not worth the labor of straining it. The olive oil didn't turn the mixture into either of the colors promised. I used all red tomatoes and it ended up an unappealing pale salmon color. I dislike the bitter taste of raw onion so only used a small shallot. Perhaps that bitterness will be gone after it has chilled in the tomato puree overnight. My favorite gazpacho uses a can o tomatoes, half a mild onion, a whole English cucumber, a large roasted red pepper from a jar, red wine vinegar, olive oil.

### Recipe: Best Gazpacho

- **User Display Name:** Bill
- **Comment Body:** I have traveled extensively in Spain, including Seville, and even though I had gazpacho at least once a day I never encountered this version.  On the other hand, when I was in Spain I never had gazpacho exactly the same twice since gazpacho is traditionally made from ingredients on hand at the moment, and therefore varies from day to day and cook to cook.  This version tastes more like V-8 or tomato juice without the sherry vinegar.

- **Comment Body:** Had gazpacho in Spain every single day, fell in love with it (even just out of a package from the grocery store there). Tried to find something comparable when I got home, never could, even online.   THIS is the gazpacho I remember. It's perfect.   Use half the cucumber skins. I don't strain -- I love it thick and chunky. Use Campari tomatoes -- perfect for it.

- **Comment Body:** What a grease bomb!   The large quantity of oil certainly did not make delicious gazpacho.  Rather, it took the scrumptious flavors of fresh seasonal vegetables and dulled them past the point of recognition.    This is a better recipe for making gazpacho at a time when all you have is canned or out-of-season vegetables shipped in from the other side of the globe, and you need a large amount of quality extra-virgin oil just to make them taste like something that resembles food.

- **Comment Body:** I absolutely ADORE this recipe. I've made two tweaks over the years that (at least I think) make it even better: 1) I put the chopped tomatoes in a colander over a bowl to let the watery juice come out before whizzing it in the blender; I don't like how the water separates out in the fridge and I like the soup just a little thicker anyway; 2) I add 4 ounces of white bread, crusts removed--it thickens it a little more. #2 is optional but I like the touch of sweetness and body that it adds.

- **Comment Body:** Made this today and it is delightful - fresh and a perfect way to use summer's bounty. It must be chilled for at least a few hours. It tastes good initially but the complexity comes from chilling the mixture together. I used half as much oil and still thought it was too much; and the onion was too pronounced - I would switch to a shallot or only a quarter sweet onion next time. Agree with another comment on leaving on half of the cucumber skins.

Such a nice result, I may just make it this way all the time. Can't taste the watermelon, but thinking it may add a touch of sweetness to help the flavor of the tomatoes.

Peeling the tomato skins is really key for the texture. I prefer only half a clove raw garlic, as to not overpower the other flavors. And if you have good Spanish sherry vinegar from Jerez, be bold with the vinegar and salt... it is so delicious.

Slice up the vegetables and throw them in the food processor. Add remaining ingredients and blend to desired consistency (I like mine evenly chunky). Very digestible.

Even with less, should be sufficient for a 9- or 10-inch tart.For the best color, make sure the curd is not overcooked (i.e. grainy) and be sure to cool (it thickens as it cools) before pouring into tart shell. If possible, make curd a day in advance. Will keep a week or more, refrigerated.

I have made this recipe twice; the first time I forgot the butter till the end, and kept the lovely color.  This time I followed the directions and the butter lightened the cranberry puree to a pinkish-orangey tone, less attractive.  The old NY Times Cookbook recipe for lemon meringue pie left the butter to the end, with I think good results.

- **Comment Body:** I too struggled with the volume of the cranberry mush after straining; to cut the tartness and to add volume, I made a stove-top vanilla custard and layered the cranberry curd on top, which ended up filling the pan perfectly, and the flavor combo is yummy! Baking it creates the lovely, bright color; it will look pasty before that. Cracking, roasting and peeling 50 raw hazelnuts was nuts (pun intended). Boil the nuts in baking soda in water and rise off skin in a cool bath; so much easier!

I used the pulp remaining in my mesh sieve in Mark Bittman's basic muffin recipe and the pulp (cranberry/orange peel) made a perfect flavoring.

I ran everything through once, then ran the pulp through a couple more times, yielding a full cup of cranberry mixture. This seemed to be the perfect amount to then create the curd to fill a 10" tart pan.3) I replaced the butter with Earth Balance and the sugar with coconut sugar.

For max yield, don't let cranberries cook down Strained cranberries yield abt 1 1/2 C.  - Best make curd day or even week bf.  Temper eggs bf adding - ok with 3 whole eggs  May need 1 tsp cornstarch Crust - ok with 2 c almond flr and no rice flr

- **Comment Body:** Came out perfectly. Used 2 oz orange juice. Cooked the cranberries until they mostly broke down, then pushed through a sieve. Cooked the custard until it was steaming and really thick. Kept it in the refrigerator overnight and cooked the crust and tart the next morning. Had plenty of curd to fill the tart pan. Good cranberry red color. Everyone loved it.

- **Comment Body:** I made this twice-very popular. I did not strain the curd - used an immersion blender to purée. This results in a gorgeous red. For the crust, I used King Arthur gluten-free flour which works better for the crust. I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup and increased the butter to 4 oz because it was too crumbly. For the filling, I increased the cranberries to 18 ounces, butter to 4 oz, and used 3 eggs   3 yolks, leaving the sugar at 1 cup which made enough to fill the 10” tart yet not too sweet.

Not at all fresh dark cranberry as pictured, but the pink beige others have complained about. If / When I try again, I will either up the orange juice quantity, or try the immersion technique with cranberries, as I think low amount of dark juice liquid was the culprit. The crust is amazing, though, and worth the trouble!

For the crust: - Remove as many hazelnut skins as you can but don’t sweat their presence too much - Add vodka instead of water (for flakiness)  For the curd: - Use three whole eggs - Use 1/2 stick butter (half the called for amount); Add it at the very end (after the eggs) - After cooking cranberries with orange peel, remove the peel and put the cranberries in a Vitamix blender; purée until smooth and skip the straining step

- **Comment Body:** I agree about the curd to crust ratio.  I was surprised by how thick the crust was.  I personally prefer a thinner crust, though luckily my family didn't mind the thick crust.  On the tartness, it was too sweet for me, but I prefer things to be pretty tart.  Next time I will reduce the amount of the crust and I will use 1/2 the amount of sugar and substitute a lemon in place of the orange.  The orange I used was very sweet.

- **Comment Body:** This recipe was a Christmas Eve hit and turned out wonderfully! I followed the recipe exactly, but took the advice of some reviewers and doubled the curd. I was glad that I did because I needed a bit extra. I agree that it would be helpful to know exactly how much orange juice to add (not all oranges are created equal) and how much liquid one should have after mashing the mixture through a sieve. I decorated the tart with a dusting of powdered sugar, a few fresh cranberries and holly leaves.

- **Comment Body:** You cooked the eggs when you added them! The cranberry butter mix was too hot, so when you added the eggs, it cooked. That’s why the recipe calls for adding a cup of cranberry first, to temper it, when the proportions are close to equal so it can’t cook it. Then you add it to the rest of the cranberry juice.

It took about 5 minutes of gentle working with a spatula. Keep at it, and you will be rewarded.Made two - one with 3 limes instead of orange. Both were tasty, but the lime version was more popular with everyone.

The second time I made it, I didn't have any fresh oranges so I used 1/2 cup fresh orange juice and 2 tbsp frozen orange zest that I sieved out when I strained the curd.   Watch the temperature for both cooking the cranberries and the final curd. By keeping the cranberries below 200F and the eggs around 160F, I got a much smoother set/finish on the final tart.

Use tart cherry juice if need more liquid. 3. Purée cranberry mixture finely in blender or food processor before sieving. 4. Fine mesh sieving was 30 mins; try medium mesh sieve. 5. Reduced sugar to a little less than 3/4 cup. *6.To hold color: do *not* add butter until *after* adding eggs, heated curd to near bubbling, and cooled.

My only note for next time is that the filing ended up a little short in the crust; I would probably use 16 oz. of cranberries next time plus a TBS more of butter and one more egg yolk. Oh, and I hated trying to get the skins off the hazelnuts, so fussy, so I gave up with half still on, and the crust was still amazing.

- **Comment Body:** Recipes for cooking fruit curds are often vague as to what "thickened" means. This recipe is no exception. You don't want to overcook the mixture and ruin it, but it needs to be cooked.  Stirring the curd with one hand, I Googled "Cooking fruit curd" with the other and found a video from joyofbaking.com, wherein she states that curds should be cooked to 160 degrees.   Also, I sieved the fruit through a tamis (sp?). I tasted the leftover solids and they were delicious!

It tastes great, but I don't think it pairs terribly well with the cranberry. It's also very delicate and crumbly, easy to make a mess of. You could also probably double the amount of filling for an 11-inch tart pan, there was definitely a lot of crust compared to a thin amount of filling. I bet this would make some extraordinary mini tarts, too!

- **Comment Body:** I’ve made this with a half graham cracker/ half hazelnut crust and a pure graham cracker crust and it’s phenomenal. Full stop.   Honestly it doesn’t matter what crust you use. The curd is so unctuous and delicious.   Make this for thanksgiving. You’ll never make a pumpkin pie again.

- **Comment Body:** Made this curd exactly as described--Turned out beautifully and had a wonderful color! Also decorated it with some homemade candied cranberries. Lastly, didn't have access to any hazelnuts, so I used an Ida Gardner lemon curd tart recipe for the crust (flour, sugar, butter, vanilla) and baked two smaller, 7in tarts. I made it all ahead of time and baked it the day of (froze the crust and refrigerated the curd).Guest LOVED it!https://www.pinterest.com/pin/279293614369658545/

- **Comment Body:** OH one more note: I haven't tried lessening the sugar like other reviewers have, but I completely agree that the recipe as written is far too sweet. To alleviate that (I wasn't sure if reducing the sugar would compromise the structure of the curd) I added a healthy pinch of salt. Much improved! Definitely taste as you go. Fills 10" tart pan perfectly.

- **Comment Body:** I already reviewed this, but after eating the tart over a couple of days, would take the advice of others and try Melissa Clark’s lemon poppyseed crust next time. The hazelnuts are a bit rich and compete somewhat with the wonderful flavor of the curd.

- **Comment Body:** For step 6, I found a shortcut that works beautifully and yields a bright reddish liquid. After the cranberries are cooked to bursting, transfer the cranberry mixture from the pan to a blender. Purée the mixture, covering the blender lid with a kitchen towel and holding it on as it operates. When the mix is well-puréed, pour it through a medium-mesh sieve or colander into a bowl and proceed with the rest of the steps.

- **Comment Body:** This is really good, a nice variation on my usual cranberry orange relish (1 bag c, 1 cup sugar, 1 orange, blend all in food processor until smooth 48 hours before needed).   1) The curd is a little sloppy. Bake longer? Cook on stovetop longer? 2) Not quite as much volume as I wanted, and there was a lot of cranberry pulp left over. Should I process the pulp more to extract more juice?

- **Comment Body:** This may be my new favorite dessert! Visually stunning and not too sweet. I followed others' suggestions and substituted 1 cup almond flour for the hazelnuts. I substituted POM for half of the orange juice, which added to the already intense ruby color. With the 2 egg whites left over from making the curd, I made a meringue (1/4 cup sugar and a pinch of cream of tartar) and piped a few stars on top of the filling before baking.

- **Comment Body:** To echo what Eileen said 5 years ago, I baked the lemon/almond crust, minus poppyseeds, from Melissa Clark's ricotta tart recipe. It's enough for a 10" tart pan, and tantalizingly flaky. This is the 3rd time I've made this curd. I pureed the cranberry mixture with an immersion blender and quickly worked it through a sieve using a spatula. For a 10 inch pan I make 1 1/2 times the curd recipe. I garnished with pomegranate seeds, zested and microplaned orange rind, and pinches of fresh rosemary.

Used the 2c of almond flour for the tart, which worked well (hazelnut allergy) and doubled filling for 9.5” pan. It was too much filling. Recommend immersion blender, color was perfect.

- **Comment Body:** Lovely and luscious dessert made per recipe but for one change in the crust.  I started with 180g Bob's Red Mill Hazelnut flour rather than roasting and grinding fresh hazelnuts.  Worked perfectly.  See my earlier comment re crust.  Otherwise, recipe as written and using tip in Step 6 for using immersion blender on cranberry mixture before straining.  My tart pan was 9" so there was a little crust mix leftover.  Delicious curd filled just right.   Leftovers worked as breakfast treat.

- **Comment Body:** I used two cups of almond flour instead of the rice flour and hazelnuts-- the crust came out very nice. But (like a lot of people) I had trouble getting the curd to set. Ended up adding a tsp of cornstarch (I'd add more next time) to the custard before pouring it in the crust and baking the filled pie at 370 for about 25 minutes. But in the end it was a success! Very nice, moderately tangy counterpoint to all the heavy fruit pies and pumpkin everything we were serving.

- **Comment Body:** If you want avoid some headache, I recommend the Julia Child/Alice Medrich method for peeling the hazelnuts rather than the oven method (which did not work for me).1. Add 3 Tbs of baking soda to 2 cups of boiling water.2. Add the hazelnuts and boil for about 3 minutes until the skin removes easily from a hazelnut that you tested.3. Pour the contents into a colander and run under cold water. Fyi, the water will be black.4. Remove skin. I used a paper towel to help remove the skin.

Using the immersion blender just a little bit before straining really helped the process along, too. Also added a little bit of nutmeg and cardamum to the curd, which only made it taste more festive!

I meant to measure my orange juice; I had a large orange, and I think a medium might have been a tiny bit better. The curd set really nicely and tastes great. I considered reducing the sugar but I'm glad I didn't; I also added a tiny bit of salt. The crust:curd ratio might be a bit high but the crust tastes so great I don't even mind!

Because my cooking schedule was packed, I made the crust with 2 cups of almond flour, butter, and sugar. I don't know who needs to hear this, but put your tart pan (the ones with a removable bottom) on a baking sheet. Crust number one died when I foolishly took it out of the oven while supporting it from the bottom. Did everything else as written and I was pleased

Didn't make this crust at all, made my favourite tart crust. 2. It's Christmas, so I wanted that incredible rich colour: blended the cranberries & sieved out the skins. Worked beautifully; the colour is gorgeous and velvety. 3. Baked an extra whopping 15 MINUTES! I don't know whether I didn't thicken it enough in the first place, but I watched it carefully and it worked!

Used a regular pecan shortbread crust--didn't feel like doing GF and didn't need to. Used Earth Balance in place of regular butter: it works. It turned out beautifully. I might sieve next time, but I loved the combination of flavors. Got a ton of brightness and tartness from the crans and they balanced perfectly with the buttery pecans!

Whisked in eggs and added an extra yolk. Cooked to 172, cooled to 140, then blended in butter with an immersion blender. The curd was perfection.   Day 2, filled the crust and baked for 10 min. Garnished with sugared cranberries & rosemary and mini meringue kisses. The sugared cranberries gave a nice punch of tart and crunch.

- **Comment Body:** Some notes from a novice baker: — Substitute normal flour for rice flour and almonds for hazelnuts (or go 50/50 on the nuts) — Don’t worry if you miss some hazelnut skins — Don’t overbook your cranberry mixture; aim for syrup not jam — Use a full stick of butter for the curd (the recipe has an error in weights of butter) — Watch the video to see the desired thickness when you’re cooking the curd. Don’t worry too much—you can always bake the tart longer (I did 20 mins) if you undercook the curd

- **Comment Body:** I made it both with hazelnut and almond meal, as suggested by many readers. Almond flavor works better with cranberries. The recipe is written for an experienced baker so a couple of comments. Use pie weights or take the crust out halfway through and press it back into shape with your fingers. 15 minutes is not enough baking time more like 20 (I do 23 at 325 convection). The quantities of filling are OK if you are using blender; with sieve there is waste, so you will have to up the filling.

Roasting was also less messy and easier to clean up in my opinion.

Mine probably cooked 13/15 minutes and turned into jam, so my curd was thick and unable to be strained even after blending. Once all was assembled and baked I didn’t really notice the little pieces as much as I thought I would. My tip after reading recipe and others notes Don’t Over Cook The Cranberry Mixture! I used toasted pecans instead of hazelnuts and was pleased.

Buttery smooth and neon red, indeed! I'll absolutely make again...except the hazelnut peeling method. What a disaster. Didn't work in the slightest. Unless you want to be individually rubbing of flaking hazelnut skins for over an hour, find a different method. I'd either lightly toast hazelnut flour, or do something else entirely.

The hazelnut flavor comes thru wonderfully - I don't freeze the crust before backing,  just pop it in the oven after it is pressed into the pan - I don't let the curd cool to room temperature before adding to the shell.  Just pour it and bake - I bump up the cranberries to closer to a full pound, and increase sugar accordingly.  makes a fuller tart

- **Comment Body:** Big hit at Thanksgiving. For hazelnut skins, I used boiling tip provided by someone else: but be sure to use pan with high sides, baking soda foams up a lot when added. Skins came off easily, but still bit of a process. I toasted nuts after removing skins. For cranberries, I used food mill--was fast and easy, with plenty of filling. Egg yolks lightened up color, but it was still cranberry-hued, not pink shown in photo. Used 9" pan, and baked crust a little longer because thicker.

I also went at the mixture with the immersion blender before straining, as suggested in the comments. I made no other alterations. It's absolutely delicious and it came out beautifully! It's a vivid red, and I've had no problems with the crust sticking or falling apart. I will definitely make this again next holiday.

I used the Julia Child method for removing the hazelnut skins and it worked perfectly. I later discovered that Bob's Red Mill makes hazelnut flour, so if I make it again I'd be inclined to try that. I used the immersion blender on the cranberries before straining them. It made my kitchen look like a crime scene but the tart's color was great!

- **Comment Body:** This cranberry curd tart is a delicious addition to a Thanksgiving dessert menu as it balances out the often overly-sweet traditional fare. My husband and I love cranberries and appreciate their tartness, so we slightly decreased the sugar in the curd and were pleased with the results. Like many others, I wasn't in the mood for the cumbersome crust recipe, so I used a simple shortbread crust instead. The buttery sweetness of the shortbread paired nicely with the cranberries.

If I do it again, I’ll use the Vitamix and add more liquid because it was very difficult pushing this through a sieve and there were still seeds.  I piped the curd into individual crusts and topped with a chewy meringue cookie.  Dropping these off at my 79 y.o Dad’s nursing home this afternoon. Hopefully it will serve as a more seasonal stand-in for his favorite lemon meringue and he can enjoy them while we wave through the window.  Dang COVID

- **Comment Body:** I went along with other comment suggestions and substituted two cups of almond flour for the hazelnuts/rice flour which was much cheaper and tasted great. I also recommend NOT straining the cranberries and simply puree the entire mixture as finely as possible. I added a second orange and orange peel which made the flavor much stronger. I wouldn’t have had any liquid to strain out in my simmered cranberries and this way the color was more vibrant

- **Comment Body:** I made this recipe and it came out well. I used a pie dish because I didn’t have a tart dish. I used store bought pie dough and used extra in the sides. It had extra crust but was delicious with the curd.   I would cut down on the orange zest and the orange juice. It’s very tart and the orange was overpowering!   Not sure you should just do zest or just do juice but it was way too much in my experience.

- **Comment Body:** I knew I had to make this the first time I saw it!  I love tart fruits so cranberries with orange are perfect for a curd.  The crust was like a hazelnut cookie; delicious.  The problem for me was trying to strain the cranberries to get rid of skins to make a smooth curd.  I very quickly saw that the amount of liquid would be too little for the tart.  So I just used the fruit mash.  It was fine for us; tasted great and had a gorgeous color.  Will make this again.

- **Comment Body:** Okay I've now made this tart FOUR times (twice last year twice this year) and I have a note:  Pot size matters a lot (or how long u cook/temperature). As was noted, the final volume of the mixture is not in the recipe. I made it once in a 10qt dutch oven, twice 1.5 qt pot and found best results using a 4 qt pan. When there's too much liquid you end up with two much filling that's less flavorful and takes longer to set (either in pot or oven).  Also don't worry about getting all the skins off!

- **Comment Body:** This recipe was enjoyable to bake and eat. I had hoped for a *really intense* tartness, which it does not have, but that's okay (maybe that's too much to ask of anything besides a lemon-based recipe).  Also, I didn't have hazelnuts on hand so I went with an almond-based crust instead. In my opinion, the almond flavor didn't totally jibe with the filling, so if you're planning to swap crusts, consider a regular flour crust.

The crust pooled into the tart pan and completely lost its shape, even after freezing for multiple hours. While rushing to rebake, I realizing that 6 tablespoons of butter most definitely does not equate to 100 grams! A stick of butter is tbsp, or 113 grams (as marked). 6 tbsp == 85 grams! Using this amount worked well the 2nd time.

For filling, pureed in a high speed blender for a couple of minutes then strained, only 1/4c solids left.  But the payoff: served it at the end of a blowout Christmas Eve meal, and the whole table oooed and ahhhed over the color, then fell silent to savor each bite.

Also, I forgot about the rice flour - I didn’t have any and just used AP flour and it was fine.   Definitely don’t skip the step to purée the cranberry mixture! Makes it so much easier to get through a sieve, and as others have commented, made for a vibrant red final product - will make again!

- **Comment Body:** If you are allergic to nuts use another crust, like a shortbread crust Ive seen for lemon tarts, or a graham cracker or even animal cookie crust. If you are allergic to hazelnuts use walnuts or anything else. I think pistachio would be stunning.

- **Comment Body:** If you make the crust and the curd in advance they will both take much longer to bake, since you’re starting off with colder products. The crust took around 25 minutes to bake. The curd (refrigerated overnight) about    15-20 minutes. I love pecans and used Trader Joe’s toasted, salted pecans in place of the hazelnuts. It eliminated the toasting and skinning of the nuts and the results were delicious!

- **User Display Name:** Jessie
- **Comment Body:** Super underwhelmed by this recipe. Made this w/ traditional crust— guess that could be the problem, maybe it balances the flavor. My issue is that the orange peel gave a muddy tropicana like taste when I was expecting bright cranberry flavor to accompany the fuchsia result. Wouldn’t make again as written. Might try w/o orange peel or w/ lemon or cranberry juice instead. Also was less firm than pumpkin pie. Meh. Used immersion blender and pushed blended mash through sieve.

- **Comment Body:** Having an 11" French tart pan, I added another 6 oz. of cranberries to the recipe but nothing else, as well as 1/4 c. port, 1 tsp cinnamon.  Had enough curd this way.  I let the cranberry mixture cool before I processed it.  I didn't notice the color going from red to lighter red until I added the eggs.  The butter didn't change the color but I did add it at the end of the cooking process.  The curd was quite tart.  But it didn't thrill me and was much too fiddle-y a recipe to do again.

- **User Display Name:** SCA
- **Comment Body:** This is daal, minus a few essential seasonings.Best made by sautéing the onions, then adding ginger and garlic paste to taste; sautéing fresh chopped tomatoes (no paste); adding spices (turmeric, coriander powder, chili powder, a touch of cinnamon if you like) once the oil has taken on the red color from the tomatoes and the vegetables have a glazed appearance.Not enough salt in this recipe.  Make a simple chutney with yogurt, green chilies and cilantro.

- **Comment Body:** This is a very tasty recipe but I have two suggestions:1. There is too much liquid for the amount of lentils; therefore add one or two small potatoes, diced, to give the soup more body.2. Step 4 - No need for more mess of moving half the soup into another pot; get the same rougher consistency by pureeing in one pot but in short bursts until somewhat, but not entirely smooth.

- **Comment Body:** Jules:  for this quantity (1 cup lentils), a couple of plum tomatoes should do.  Important to get nice juicy ripe tomatoes, and to sauté all the vegetables until the oil rises to the top and takes on the red tomato color, otherwise it will retain a somewhat raw taste no matter how long you simmer the soup.  That first step ensures the full release of flavor of the spices.

- **Comment Body:** You'll get more color out of the carrot and the tomato paste than the lentils. Red lentils fade rapidly to pale pink and then yellow as they are exposed to prolonged heat. But forget their color, it's the flavor and texture that makes them so desirable. If you want more red bump up the tomato or add some sweet smoked Spanish paprika--the subtle smoke note is terrific with lentils of all hues.

I like things spicy so I then adjust the seasonings (including the amount of lemon) accordingly; and I let the volume reduce a bit by not covering the pot tightly when simmering.

I followed the recipe exactly, and didn't find it too thin. I have leftovers, and keep going back to the pot for another spoonful. I will say that it gets thicker as it cools. Highly recommend, and will definitely make again.

The bones, juice at the bottom of the container, fat, any skin I don't eat right away goes into the pressure cooker for a good long blast. The stock goes into the fridge. Next day I make Melissa's red lentil soup using the reserved stock. The chicken meat can be added to the lentils after they are done. Vegans beware.

The coriander has some natural lemon essence. Added a pinch of cinnamon and also a squirt of harissa (and went easy on the chile powder). I also sautéed the carrots with the onion, but that was only because I goofed. Only change for next time - less liquid as others have also suggested. Maybe a bit more tomato paste too.

- **Comment Body:** So I just watched Milk Street Kitchen's lentil soup. I love Melissa's recipe. But I have to say the finishing touch on the MSK's recipe would be fabulous on this. Heat 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil and toast 1 Tbsp Aleppo pepper (or use a combo of smoked paprika and chilli flakes). Let the pepper steep into the oil. Drizzle on the soup. It's a 'tarka' style topping that takes this soup over the top.

The order in which the ingredients are added in this recipe isn’t consistent with Indian cuisine, and broth isn’t a typical Indian ingredient.

Served with fresh mint. Delicious!

- **Comment Body:** This is very Turkish, especially if you leave out the cilantro and give people sumac to sprinkle on top.  My mother-in-law would put in a handful of rice along with the lentils.  It binds the soup and makes it silky.  Not too much, or it gets a bit gummy.  For 7 C. water (no broth), I use about 1/4 C. of rice, and 1 1/2 C. red lentils.  I haven't tried garlic, but that sounds good.  I usually add a small stalk of celery, chopped, which maybe isn't authentically Turkish, but gives it more umami.

- **Comment Body:** This is a lentil soup if you add too many flavors you are missing the whole idea. I usually wait until the last 12 minutes to apply the Cumin as it tends to give a slight bitter taste if you cook it longer. Cilantro is very powerful when cooked I don't use it I like to taste the lentils. Finally try using  about 15% of a cup to a cup lentils ratio of Egyptian Rice if you don't like to add carrots.

You can buy herbs in little cubes in the frozen section of your (high end) supermarket- they come in so handy, especially in winter! I also added a pkg of frozen cauliflower pieces, which gave it a tad more hardiness without changing the favors. Great for a chilly day.

Had half an apple laying around so I diced that up  and threw it in as well. With the addition of the lemon juice and cilantro it turned out  to be really complex and wonderful! Spicy, a little sweet and a little sour. Love this and will continue to make it for family and friends!

- **Comment Body:** Actually this is a Turkish style soup called Mercemek. Not to take away from my own South Asian heritage, but this is not dahl. It is a simple and very elegant soup that doesn't need to be muddled with more spices. The lemon and herbs (dill or mint also work) make it tasty just fine. If you want to add another element, some extra virgin olive oil over the top won't hurt. I am all for changing things up but the simplicity of this soup should not be mistaken for lacking anything.

The finished soup was creamy and silky with just enough texture from the un-pureed veggies, and the color was gorgeous. Definitely putting this one in my rotati

Add some cinnamon and nutmeg, and a few small potatoes along with carrot that blend in really nicely at the end. I think it's too liquidy as written, so I either just do broth, or use a can of cream of chicken soup mixed with water to suffice for liquid. I also just found myself without tomato paste, so substituted with a bit of sriracha sauce. Yum!

Most restaurants in the middle-east serve with pita bread fried croutons which are delicious but, well, fried. So my variation is to cut up thin pita piece in postage stamp size, toss in a bit of olive oil and oven bake until a deep rich brown color and lightly salt if desired. Garnish the soup and keep a bowl in the middle of the table for eveyone to replenish the soup topping.

I'd do that at the same time as the other spices, and I would probably increase the other spices as well. (Measurements? I don't need no steenking measurements!) While I'm at it, I would probably use lime rather than lemon.

Once allowed to depressurize, open and stir vigorously. This thickens soup and melds ingredients without immersion blender. Flavorful.

My most useful kitchen tool is the mini electric food chopper made by Oster or Black & Decker, and it makes this chutney a breeze:  blend green chilies, a ripe tomato and any green herb of your choice i.e. parsley, mint etc., with a bit of salt.  Can be left a little chunky if you prefer.  Add a little lemon juice if the tomato isn't flavorful enough.

I also went with more than 1 carrot and more broth and less water in one iteration.  All three came out well.  My favorite variation though was to add some left over holiday ham.  The bit of pork made a huge difference.  I could see using bacon in place of ham for an equally delicious option.  Very few soups that are so easy to get right.  This recipe is a keeper!

The only change I made was to just plop the immersion blender into the pan (instead of removing half the soup) and give it  few whirls. I liked it - it was a little chunky but still smooth and with much less work.

- **Comment Body:** This soup is so tasty and good, it's hard to believe how easy it is to make.  Bright, delicious flavors!  I've made it several times and it never ceases to amaze me (and it freezes nicely as well).  The only changes I'd recommend is to add Aleppo pepper if you have it, lemon zest if you feel like it, and it's even simpler when I just purée the soup in the pot with the immersion blender, don't bother to take out half, just blend a couple of short spurts.

- **Comment Body:** All of those would significantly change the recipe. I hate to waste the rest of the can of tomato paste too so I spoon it into a freezer bag in little 1 tbsp balls, make sure they aren't touching & freeze. Then over the next few months you can grab 1 or 2 and drop them in other dishes--really boosts the flavor of jarred sauces & soups! Also, there are tubes of concentrated tomato paste, really good! refrig after opening, and not expensive when you consider they are double strength.

- **Comment Body:** Also note that although the red lentils do cook relatively quickly, it's best to soak them ahead of time.  Can be done while you sautee the vegetables and seasoning, though when I make daal I put the lentils to soak earlier in the day.I use fewer spices than when making other South Asian dishes because the red lentils have a delicious, delicate taste and aroma of their own.  Legumes like split peas can use more liberal seasoning.

- **Comment Body:** The consistency of this soup is just right for Turkish style lentil soup. My grandmother's recipe is 1 cup lentils -rinsed well-, 1 medium carrot and 1 small potato for 7 cups of liquid. I didn't have any broth so I only used water and replaced olive oil with ghee. It was delicious. If you have a middle eastern market near by I'd recommend tying this with Turkish style tomato paste. While you are there, also get some dried mint leaves to serve the soup with.

I was so devastated that I wouldn’t be able to follow it to the letter but it was a treat. I served it with coconut rice. Biggest note is do not skip the blending! My mom tried to “whisk” these (whatever that means mom) and the texture from a blender or immersion blender makes it so much more rich. I added the ginger like many commenters did.

- **Comment Body:** This was delicious and so easy!! Even easier if you buy pre-diced onion/carrots/garlic.  I didn’t have one large carrot, so used 3 medium - I could have used more, but we really like carrots in soup.  I didnt think it was spicy at all, so you could definitely add more than a pinch of chili powder.  I didn’t think it was too thin as some people have said - it is only thin if you don’t blend half the soup.  Be careful not to go overboard with lemon at the end.  Cilantro makes a huge difference.

The lemon (added zest as well) and cilantro added nice flavors.

- **Comment Body:** because the shape of the salt crystals is taken into account for the amount called for in the recipes. Kosher salt (by volume?) is less dense than table salt or fine sea salt. If you use fine salt, you might need to reduce the amount of salt you use, although it’s usually to taste anyhow. The previous reply is also important. Kosher salts do not have the mineral aftertaste of iodized table salt.

- **Comment Body:** Make sure to put the lid on partially covered, as I forgot last night and my lentils came out watery wheras the first time the soup was quite thick. It really makes a difference. Also the lemon and cilantro do give it something. I didn't measure my spices but I think I put more than the recipe says. This is a great soup I really really like it and will make it often!

I have served at dinner parties, to my grand-kids who LIKE IT - Eureka- they don't like much, to friends recovering from surgery.   It is the all purpose, go-to soup and that freezes well.

- **Comment Body:** This is really not a classic Indian recipe, unless all lentil recipes are, arguably, also Indian--this is a classic Turkish recipe, served in most Turkish restaurants, which I have been offering as part of my oriental mezze buffets for over twenty years.  The Indians have dozens of similar dishes, most of them more purees than soups--but mostly spiced differently, and with different lentils.  My favorites for Dals are Chana Dal (chickpeas) and Toor Dal (southern Indian).

The only difference is that The Week called for pan-toasted cumin seeds (toast on the stove in a small frying pan, no oil, until the seeds start to pop) rather than ground cumin; I have made it both ways and prefer it with pan-toasted cumin seeds.It's a really delicious lentil soup, quick to cook and lighter in flavor than most dals.

I made the following changes: -Used 5 C. chicken stock and 1 C water -Used 3 T. tomato paste -Added smoked paprika -Added 8 oz fresh spinach at the very end -Added lemon zest too  There's really no need to blend the soup at the end.  Red lentils fall apart if you cook them long enough.  Simmering an extra 10 mins or so does the trick.  Absolutey do not skip the lemon juice and the end.  It's esential.

- **Comment Body:** I followed the suggestion of several commenters to add a half cup of  lentils.  I disagree.  The result was like thick oatmeal sludge than even a thick soup and I was forced to cut the result with water. Make it according to the recipe the first time then decide if it's too thin - it can be reduced.  It is an excellent tasking soup and I've portioned into single servings which I froze.  It lends itself to adding bacon, slices of sausage (Merguez lamb), scallions, pickled mushrooms, or leftovers.

The "Chilly" powder I used was from an Indian grocery and was very hot. I also added half of a not so spicy jalapeno. I did not puree any of the coup. I will definitely make this again.

- **User Display Name:** Flo
- **Comment Body:** I come from Bulgaria and we also like the Turkish cook very often red lentils. If you use round red lentils, 2 cups of water and 1 cup of vegetable broth should be added, this way you get a very thick and creamy soup. Furthermore, we also add 1/2 tbs of paprika powder together with the other spices. Lastly, we use up to 7-10 tbs of blended whole tomatoes from a can (blend it yourself, it makes a difference). Add the lemon juice to each soup bowl, otherwise the soup will get spoiled faster.

Lemon zest was definitely a nice addition; rather than cumin, I used a mix of coriander powder and oregano, as the soup was preceding an Italian-ish meal.

I went classic for bowl #1 with a squeeze of meyer lemon, a glyph of olive oil, a micro-pinch of cayenne and some fresh herb. Other fave toppings for this soup: micro-thin slices of raw shitake (they melt), a streak of toasted sesame seed oil, another streak of tamari and some fresh green herb. I also love a little quartered fresh cherry tomato action in the right season.

That should be in bold in the recipe because it is important.    Also, for a hearty, comfort-foody addition, add Italian sausage when sautéing the onions.    This is a hit for friends and family.

- **Comment Body:** So easy, quick and good! This has been a winter staple for us for some time. We don't use any water, all low sodium chicken broth or homemade broth. We haven't found anyone in our family from 3 on up who doesn't love this soup.

- **User Display Name:** Nancy
- **Comment Body:** This is very delicious! I agree with Michael that there was too much liquid for the amount of lentils. I added a quarter cup of Basmati rice to cook along with the lentils and skipped the pureeing step. Also, I topped each bowl of soup with a small dollop of Greek yogurt and a sprinkling of black sea salt instead of the olive oil and chili powder.

- **Comment Body:** This is definitely one of the best soups I've made. It's our go-to with a good hunk of sourdough. A couple of notes, though: Not nearly enough cumin in the recipe - I always add at least a tablespoon. I also sometimes add slightly more than a cup of lentils. It can be too watery otherwise. Lastly, I only puree just a tad more than 1/4 of the soup. We like the chunky lentils, but a little puree does help to thicken. The lemon is the key!

- **Comment Body:** A hallmark of Melissa Clark's recipes is they are both foolproof and flexible.  So it is for this easy, tasty, quick. healthy and economical soup.  Notes: 1) I find the lentils take @ 15 min. longer than specified to be done.  2) If you don't have a good quality stock on hand (ugh to that stuff in a carton), subbing water works well.  3) I found 5C total liquid, not 6C, best.  4) Lemon juice and cilantro 'make it' at the end.  5) Needed more salt than specified.

- **Comment Body:** I tend to like overly seasoned food, so I went heavy on everything.  I left the lid slightly off, so after using my immersion blender on half of the soup, it was not watery at all.  I also subbed broth in place of water.This is great as is, but lots of room to play and use this as a base recipe.  I love that red lentils yield very low calories while still offering lots of protein and fiber, so I won't be adding potatoes to mine (not needed, anyhow).Winner!

All the other ingredients except cilantro are usually on hand. I used vegetable broth. In 45 minutes we had a superb soup. I did not dress it up with other Indian seasonings, I did not puree any of it but the texture was perfect. And I didn't send anyone out for cilantro. The soup was subtle and delicious without.  I would serve it to guests.

Indian version - after step 4 add with fried mustard and curry leaf Mediterranean version - sprinkle zaatar when serving. Mixing in sumac would do something similar. Greek version - add thyme, oregano, rosemary and bay leaf after step 4 and let it sit for a few minutes on low heat.

I use vegetable stock and do not use cilantro - I’m just not one who loves it. I garnish the soup with chopped fresh tomatoes and strained yogurt. I serve it with crusty sourdough bread or cornbread depending on whether I want something sweet to counter the spices.  This soup is great for my vegan friends and family while being hearty enough that the non-vegans don’t notice.

And I loved the lemon so much that on my last batch, I added the zest from that half-lemon in addition to the juice. The flavor is very pronounced that way, so it's only for lemon-lovers, but for me, it worked beautifully.

- **Comment Body:** a couple of plum tomatoes should do. Important to get nice juicy ripe tomatoes, and to sauté all the vegetables until the oil rises to the top and takes on the red tomato color, otherwise it will retain a somewhat raw taste 1. There is too much liquid for the amount of lentils; therefore add one or two small potatoes, diced, to give the soup more body. recipe makes 4 small bowls of soup. Double the recipe to serve 4-6  add two tablespoons of barley to give it a little silkiness.

Water and vegetable “better than bouillon” [which I don’t really measure]). Salty enough for our tastes, and the pepperyness was good on a chilly New Year’s Eve supper.

But I agree with other comments that it needs substantially more chile pepper, spices, including ginger, and garlic as well as lemon all of which I added and liked.  I'm not sure that adding the additional lentils is called for - this is soup not porridge.  If you like a thick soup to support a stand-up spoon, go ahead and add the additional half cup of lentils.  I also added several Mergez lamb sausages which worked out well for me. Could also us other sausage.

- **Comment Body:** I though this was delicious and not too thin with the full amount of water (I did increase the cayenne and tomato paste slightly after tasting it before pureeing). It was actually soup then, with a lovely texture. With less water, it was much more like dal, and also delicious. To the thicker version of the soup, I added a bag of chopped frozen kale (thawed and squeezed dry) and another half a lemon. You could play with those spices a lot. That was also delicious, but really a different dish.

It works with just the lentils, a carrot, some garlic and a stock cube or you can do the works with sweet potato etc.  Best soup ever.  Yes, I am a vego but the family isn't and it's their fave too.  However they get it.

- **Comment Body:** I made this soup incorporating similar items used by Melissa’s friend.  I replaced half the lentils with farro, included a 15oz can of diced fire roasted tomatoes and used a dollop of homemade harissa sauce instead of hot sauce.  I also like it chunky so I did not purée any of the soup.  This recipe is very forgiving and the rewards are devine.  Thanks Melissa for the recipe and article.

It was a perfect consistency once partially pureed. I served it drizzled with fine olive oil and a sprinkling of za'atar and cilantro. Yummy!

- **User Display Name:** Dawn R
- **Comment Body:** As advertised, this is the best lentil soup I’ve ever had. Definitely double the recipe, if not more. I added a lot more spices to taste than what was called for—far more kosher salt and cumin—and I skipped the cilantro. I also puréed the majority of it because I really enjoyed the smoother texture. It’s like butternut squash soup. Nothing wrong with doing it like the recipe but I was in the mood for more of creamy soup than a chunkier stew. Just excellent.

- **Comment Body:** I'm a big fan of red lentils, and I found this soup to be really nothing special: easy to prepare, OK texture (like any other pureed bean soup), very modest spicing. I was hoping for a lot more flavor. Next time I'll swap out the veggie stock (too sweet and mild) for a bolder chicken stock, I'll double the cumin and pepper, and I'll add a measurable amount of chili powder or cayenne (or chipotle or smoked paprika). Maybe another carrot, too.

Juice of one large lemon, plus another small half. Freeze dried cilantro, so as not to waste the rest of the bunch.  Excellent soup, definitely a keeper!

- **Comment Body:** Nice basic recipe easily adapted to Instant Pot - just sauté onions/garlic/spices, add broth/lentils/carrots/tomato paste, and cook on high pressure for 10 minutes. No need to purée - the pressure does it for you. Based on previous comments, I added smoked paprika and chipotle, and some fresh ginger, and increased the lentils by almost 50%. Topped with some crunchiness (coconut &/or pepitas) in addition to cilantro. Hearty and healthy.

At the end I threw in handfuls of baby spinach. I didn't blend the soup.  Super easy and quick. Would definitely make again!

- **Comment Body:** This soup has become a family favorite.  IMO it needs a little more spice than indicated.  We like to double the cumin and cayenne.  Double the salt and pepper.  As a point of reference i find most of the NYT Recipes tend to suit a slightly more democratic palate and I increase the spice and S&P amounts in most recipes.  I’ve also served this with a small dollop of Greek yogurt.  The cool, tart, creaminess of the yogurt really compliments the flavor.

The dal recipes can be found by searching for "dal".   That said, minced garlic on high heat for four minutes is a mistake.

And, with all due respect to the folks adding other kinds of tomatoes, I believe the tomato paste is there to add umami and not to make this a lentil tomato soup.

So I caved and made it. One word - "unremarkable". My personal recommendation sub out the cumin/chili powder for  2-3 t. curry powder. After the lentils have simmered, add a can of coconut milk and the tomato paste- 3T. Heat through, add 1 T. butter (opt) and some chopped cilantro. Serve over rice. Oh yeah!

I started tasting at 30 minutes and I believe it was at least another 20-25 minutes before the lenails were cooked to my preference. Different lentils have different cooking times so intend to cook them for a while and taste, adding cooking time if necessary. Hope this helps.

- **Comment Body:** Excellent. Based on several comments I used 1 1/2 cups of lentils and 5 cups of chicken broth, no water - I wanted a thicker soup. Used at least a full lemon, more chili, salt and pepper (added extra at end). Reserved about 2 cups and puréed the rest with an immersion blender. First time working with red lentils and I was pleased with the end result. (Do not judge soup until it is fully ready to serve - do not omit the lemon!)

- **Comment Body:** This is a fabulous recipe!!!!!!!!!  We loved it and are already planning on eating it next week.  We didn't add the lemon and used parsley instead of cilantro (I can't stand it!). And served it with killer Acme Olive Bread, mission fig balsamic and olive oil and it was divine!

- **Comment Body:** Like so many others, we really loved this. Cheap, nutritious, and very tasty. I used 1.5 times as many lentils as called for, and it seemed perfect. Since it was dinner, like some others are doing I added a medium potato (yukon) diced the same size as the carrot (about 1/4"); very nice. Ladled out about 1/2, blended remainder with immersion blender, added the other half back with the lemon and cilantro, along with more salt. So simple, and so delicious.

- **Comment Body:** I don't like to add oil to soup  at the end of cooking like this suggests: it always seems like trying to make-up for not getting the flavours right. Be sure your stock is hearty, if it is on the weak side, the soup will be tasteless. Water too, would weaken it.  Otherwise, it is a nice soup served with a dollop of thick Greek yogurt or sour cream. ( I doubled the spices after I read the comments.)

The generous olive oil drizzle is a must. Fantastic recipe.Some changes - I usually don't have broth and the soup powder that I used to use is full of MSG, so instead I doubled the amount of taste makers: double tomato paste, cumin, pepper and instead of chili powder, paprika powder.

Only had scallions, so used those instead of a large onion. I also only use my homemade veggie stock (yay, instapot) instead of water. I sprinkle coarsely broken dried pumpkin seeds over this to add yet another bit of consistency character.  I've made this at least 4 or 5 times and it is always a hit.

- **Comment Body:** Love this recipe.  I've made it about a dozen times and have found that the ginger is a must!  I make it with homemade chicken stock if I have it, but don't add the extra water as it makes too watery.  I also add a dash of paprika and scant bit of cayenne sometimes.  This recipe comes together so quickly and everyone loves it.  I serve it over rice too.

I cooked it so long I didn't even need to use a blender to puree the soup. The lentils fell apart but the diced carrots held their shape.

- **Comment Body:** This was an easy, quick soup. I followed others' suggestions and used an extra carrot, double the garlic, and 1/4 cup more lentils. The soup was still a tad thin to my liking, even after cooking it with the lid off.  would probably skip one of the cups of water next time. It needed a lot of salt and a full lemon of juice. The cilantro makes a big difference.

- **Comment Body:** Made this on a whim but didn't have red lentils so I used white beans (minimum 2 cans). Also did not have cilantro so left that out. Turned out deliciously, so much so that I made this again the next night. One word of caution: The recipe calls for olive oil on high heat to saute the onions in. But it is much safer to instead use an oil suited for frying, because olive oil releases harmful substances when heated on high. Other than that: Loved the recipe!

(Obviously, I prefer the spelling "chile" over "chili" — although my spelling checker doesn't agree.)

I had to add Lots of salt and lemon juice to get it to a place where I felt OK serving it. Maybe it's the red lentils...I have had many tastier lentil soups using green lentils. I'm puzzled why this gets 5 stars, especially after reading how much others need to change/add to make it good.

- **Comment Body:** This soup got us thru a 48 hr power outage; reheated on the wood stove.  So, it will forever be known as Power Outage Soup in our house!  I think the recipe would be quite bland as given.  I doubled most of the spices as several noted; also added ground coriander, baharat powder, & smoked paprika. Even then it was a bit bland the first night.  The second two nights we heated it with sliced spicy mango chicken sausage, & stirred in a dollop of plain yogurt per serving.  Yummy.

My only critical comment is that the measurements for spices, salt, and pepper, in my opinion, left the soup bland.  To be fair I like a LOT of flavor in my recipes.  I doubled the salt, black pepper and chili pepper measurements.  Result was that one of my sons thought the extra cayenne was too much, one felt not enough.  Just right for me. The squeeze of lemon at the end is Essential

I added twice the garlic, twice the lemon juice, and when it was cold I dumped out almost all the liquid that had accumulated on the top. Only then was it substantial and flavorful. Next time I would reduce the water to one cup, or perhaps even leave out the water altogether and only add it as needed.

It became apparent early on that the soup would be way too thick, so I did add one cup and it was perfect.  Glad I didn't dink around with the recipe; wonderful as is.

Used 1.5 to 2x the spices and added sambal chile paste to taste. Second time I cooked cilantro into the soup which was nice. As with most things, I double the garlic... or more.

- **Comment Body:** This recipe is perfect the way it is written. As I have a vegetarian daughter, we use a chicken flavored vegetarian "Better than Bouillon" as the broth base and it is fabulous. If your lemon is large, use a bit less. The lemon is a real brightener of the soup. We made homemade bread to go with it and even my extremely picky ("why would I eat a lentil") husband loved it. I'm sure all of the variations suggested are grand, but start with the original and you'll be thrilled.

- **Comment Body:** Delicious soup made following several of the raters' suggestions; I used Roma tomatoes with the garlic and onion instead of tomato paste. I used 3 carrots and 2 small potatoes. I used the immersion blender to make a nice thick consistency. I put the soup back on the heat and added some chopped fresh greens ( I happened to have kale and dandelion on hand) and cooked until they were wilted. Then I added the cilantro and fresh squeezed lemon just as I served it. Delicious then and as leftovers.

### Recipe: Red Lentil Soup

- **User Display Name:** Anne
- **Comment Body:** Sam Sifton wrote this morning:"the idea that you have to follow an ingredients list closely to do so is bunk." Armed thusly I made this soup for our dinner, subbing as needed because a patriot doesn't run out to the store for the "nice to haves". A smoky thick salsa subbed for the tomato paste, and ordinary lentils for the red lentils. I doubled the lemon, increased the chile powder, and added a few stalks of finely chopped celery. It was lovely, with a dollop of sour cream and garlic bread.

I incorporated a lot of suggestions: added ginger, tumeric and corander to the onions and garlic, at the last minute of sautéeing; then added a can of diced tomatoes, a couple of potatoes for body, a bag of spinach at the end, the better part of a bunch of cilantro. Oh, and the three carrots. Not sure how much this resembles the original recipe, but it is soul-satisfying.

- **Comment Body:** I just made this and loved the flavor! I added extra unsalted organic culinary chicken stock to replace the water for a deeper flavor, an additional 1/2 cup of red lentils for a thicker soup, and a dash or two of smoked paprika. No need to separate the soup for blending, in my opinion. Just stick your immersion blender in the pan for about 30 seconds or so. Excellent, and a lovely version of dahl without the curry flavor. A keeper!

I was completely satisfied with the flavor; a type of contentment settled in after the meal, what is a kind of rarified experience. I followed the advice of another user and replaced the water with a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes, added some water as needed while cooking. Also added 5-cups of spinach near the end. Used an immersion blender for about 1 minute.  I think it's hard to mess this recipe up.

If you really want to blend it but don’t have any kind of blender (like me the first two times I made it) a hand mixer will do the trick, but the texture when it’s not blended is also perfectly nice. I make it as is—add lots of lemon! It makes four servings and I find it filling. My partner and I always have leftovers for the next day.

After tasting, I only added another 1/4 teaspoon salt and a dash more chili powder. I let it sit for nine hours to give the flavors time to meld. The result? A soup that slaps so hard my ears are still ringing, my cheeks hurt, and I got a palm print plastered on my face. I will eat this every day for the rest of my life. Thank you for the recipe, Melissa.

If you give the soup an extra 5-10minutes, you don't need to blend it. The lemon juice is a wonderful addition as is the cilantro but I don't have fresh cilantro in the house all of the time. It is good without it too. This recipe is excellent as is. Adding other spices makes a good soup too, just not this soup.

### Recipe: Birria de Res (Beef Birria)

- **User Display Name:** Louis Peña
- **Comment Body:** There is a growing vegan scene in Mexico which seems unique compared to Mexican-American vegans. For that I look to blogs by Mexicans in Mexico (you can run Google Translate). Here is a birria example: https://loveveg.mx/receta/birria-vegana/    JACKFRUIT is another option I’ve used. But don’t use straight out of can, you must sauté pieces first to drive out water, adding a little oil, dash of smoked paprika, cumin and nutritional yeast to coat before using in this (or any Mexican) recipe.

I like to add a couple anchos or pasillas and a couple chiles de arbol, as well as some coriander and a couple allspice berries. A mix of oxtail, short rib and chuck roast works great if you can't get bone-in beef shoulder

- **Comment Body:** i thought the amount of chiles in this recipe seemed kind of puny and then i read the accompanying article. it states in regard to mr. centeno "The foundation of his recipe doesn’t change: warm spices, about eight kinds of chiles, a lot of cilantro and canned tomatoes." of course the article goes on to say there's no "one" version of birria, but since this is specifically based on centeno's it's kind of sad the main ingredient has been stripped down so much. would love to know the actual recipe.

- **Comment Body:** I suspect fried tofu or firm tofu that has been frozen, thawed and squeezed would be best for this, or it will fall apart and become nasty. Another option would be the bean curd knots (sometimes called yuba) that can be found at Asian grocery stores -this is tough, thin sheets of been curd that has been sliced and knotted, and partially dried -it can hold up to long cooking. One more thought would be to try this Mapo Tofu style, adding very soft bean curd right at the end.

- **Comment Body:** This was amazing! Whole family loved it. Made few relatively insignificant changes: used beef stock instead of water, caramelized the onions quite a bit, added much much more garlic than listed, used a combination of poblano, guajillo, and pasilla peppers, added some tomato paste and also some Mexican chocolate (minimal, but added a nice undertone). Once I make this again, I’ll likely do the same because the result was amazing. But I’m not trying to show off - particularly while being a deviant.

Also, I did not add the 4-6 cups water and instead used whole canned tomatoes with its juice and that made a ton of sauce.

Given how lean elk is, I browned one small grass fed beef marrow bone and roasted it with everything else. I cooked everything at 300F for about 5 hours. Perfectly tender and moist.  It turned out so delicious! The sauce was so dynamic with a perfect kick.  Served the meat shredded in the sauce with bay leaf fragranced rice and fresh corn tortillas.

Otherwise I’d do the blender stuff first then brown the meat and combine. Also I’d salt the meat AFTER browning, the salt makes the meat surface moist which makes it harder to brown.  It’s set up for you to mess around and try stuff. Enjoy.

The rendered fat from the ribs allowed me to omit the oil.

The aroma was incredible, and the dish was sublime.

- **Comment Body:** My substitute for cilantro is parsley AND some other flavorful herb (my choices are mint, basil, or lemon thyme, depending on the dish) chopped together.  Parsley alone is not enough (dull flavor), but chopping parsley in equal portions with a bright herb does the trick for me.  For those who insist (with a superior air) that if I just kept eating cilantro i will learn to love it, I gladly will do so when you commit to eating a bar of soap until you "learn to love" it.

- **Comment Body:** CFXK is correct. By some genetic mischance, a few people experience the taste of cilantro as soapy. Sometimes intensely soapy. Don't goad cilantro haters to "learn to love it" unless you are prepared to reprogram their DNA. As to Theabroma's (did you mean Theobroma as in Theobroma cacao?) condescending observation that parsley is no substitute for cilantro, know that there is no herb with substantial similarity to the flavor of cilantro. Just pick one that you like.

- **Comment Body:** Used sriracha and chilli powder to replace the aji Amarion  paste and aji panca paste. Other than that, followed the recipe as it is. The chicken tasted fantastic, Very moist and well seasoned. Made the sauce Saturday night and thought it tasted mediocre. Sunday night took the sauce out, a miracle must have occurred overnight, it tasted brilliant- super creamy and full of flavor. But will cut the ingredients in half to make the sauce. The recipe yields about 4 cups sauce, too much for a 3.5 bird

Trust me, it ain't parsley.  It is unique.  It is one of a kind.  I now put it in everything.  Even salads, any beans I do, and my son told me to try it on ice cream, I might like it.

If fact, I drizzle any marinade still in the bowl over the chicken so as not to lose any of that wonderful flavor. And I marinade the chicken for at least 24 hours. Why go to the trouble of making this delicious dish and do something to REDUCE the flavor? We make this at least twice a month - our favorite.

Cheese used was called “fresh cheese,” something akin to farmers cheese or Mexican queso fresco. We often saw the sauce atop gorgeous filets of sea bass as well. Heavenly!

I baked with 3 lbs thighs and added sweet potato rounds while cooking (I allowed  them a dunk In the marinade after placing chicken in pan). This is a do-again, and again

I usually make extra sauce and then toss it with any leftover chicken (fork-shredded) to make a spicy cilantro chicken salad.  Slap that on some toasted rolls with a tomato and sliced onion and it's lunch for the rest of the week!

- **Comment Body:** 450 degrees is high to roast a chicken with marinade, and if your chiles burned, they would be bitter. Cilantro stems are not bitter in my experience, and the literature supports this. Taste the marinade before using it, and if it's not bitter, lower the roasting temp to 400 and see if that fixes the problem.

I couldn't find either of the chili pastes on my grocery shop, but did find dried, ground aji amarillo, and added water to make a paste. I had to dial down the amount of chile just a touch because the paste I made was HOT. It felt a little wrong to wipe off the marinade, so I half-heartedly wiped some of it off, but everything came out beautifully, and that green sauce is a winner. Bravo!

- **Comment Body:** Fermented wheat is an ingredient in producing soy sauce, so it can contain gluten, theoretically enough to trigger in someone with true celiac disease. Tamari traditionally is made without the fermented wheat, but there are exceptions. So it is worth checking the list of ingredients if there is a concern. Many producers are beginning to label the gluten-free soy/tamari sauces as such.

Also note, some (many?) stores - including Whole Foods and Trader Joe's - now sell whole chickens (organic, air-chilled) pre-cut in half ("spatchcocked"). You may have to search for them carefully, though, as they don't "look" like whole chickens at all - but rather, more like flattened "parts".

This can be achieved with either with a little cotija (but then what do you do with all that cotija left over?) but a tablespoon of mayonaise or sour cream works. But no cumin, oregano, honey, dijon, that's for sure! The chicken too...way too fussy. I've no idea this recipe was written by someone who's ever been to Peru.

However, I would caution some of the other flavor notes that your are going to use because mint does NOT work with everything.  Flat leaf parsley and fresh basil are another way to go.  Hope this helps.

- **Comment Body:** WOW this sauce is amazing! I used my immersion blender: no problem with it separating. I used Mk. Vikos feta, the very best brand I've found in supermarkets. (Actually from Greece.) Fresh oregano I used a piece of roasted ancho chile I'd frozen from my garden last year instead of the paste. I used a good, light-flavored EV olive oil (I'm wondering if a strong olive oil might have caused the bitterness some people talked about? Have had that issue with homemade mayo sometimes.) SUPERB!

Chicken was not browning so switched to convection at 425 degrees to get more color.  Sauce was great.  Served with black beans and roasted summer squash.  Will be making this again.

- **Comment Body:** Instead of filling the kitchen with smoke from a 450 degree oven, I grill roasted the chicken.  Made a hot charcoal fire on one side of the grill.  Put an empty cast iron pan over the coals for ten minutes.  Then put the two chicken halves on for ten minutes.  Flipped them for six more minutes.  Then I moved the pan to the cooler side, covered the grill, and cooked it until the thighs were 175 degrees.  It came out very well and kept the kitchen clean.

It tasted almost as good as my local brasa, and I will make it this way in the future.  When it warms up, low and slow on the grill.

- **Comment Body:** There are dozens of way to make this dish, but most recipes call for two different kinds of Peruvian chile pastes — aji amarilla and aji panca — to add the necessary complexity and heat. You can find them at South American markets and online. But in a pinch, you can substitute a red chile paste (like sriracha or sambal) for the aji amarillo, and ground pasilla chile powder for the aji panca.

- **Comment Body:** I will jump on the “you could learn to love cilantro” bandwagon. I remember when I was a kid and found my mom cleaning a bunch of cilantro in the kitchen, encouraging me to try it. I was repulsed by the smell alone and when I put a leaf in my mouth I immediately spit it back out. Decades later, I have learned to love to complexity of the herb. Just as anchovies (thought to be repulsive by some) without argument add complexity to and improve upon a Caesar dressing. Just try to have an open mind!

- **Comment Body:** The chicken was excellent, but the marinade volume needs to be increased by about 50% for easy coating of the chicken (at least Costco sized birds). We did not care for the sauce -- we found it somewhat bitter. We much prefer the sauce in the Best Recipes book called Spicy Mayonnaise which included lime, mint leaves, and jarred jalapeno peppers.

- **Comment Body:** This is delicious! Awesome chicken. I ended up having double the sauce because somehow I purchased insanely potent jalapenos and had to double down on everything else to temper them. This was a happy mistake because that sauce is a delight. Put some on my lunch tacos. Dunked sweet potato fries in it. Tonight's grain bowls will most likely end up with a glob of it.  If you're one of those unlucky souls who find cilantro soapy, try it with your favorite bright/soft herb(s).

For leftover chicken and sauce:  I shred or dice the chicken, put over a bed of mixed greens topped with avocado, orange segments, pickled red onion, pepitas and crumbled feta. I make a dressing by squeezing the orange and adding a few splashes from my pickled red onions whisked with the green sauce. Toss everything together. Leftovers you actually look forward to eating!!

- **Comment Body:** I made the marinade as written but modified the aji verde sauce a little after making it the first time. For one, I think a little mayo makes the sauce creamier so instead of 1/2 cup of olive oil I did 1/4 cup mayo and 1/4 cup oil. Also omitted cumin, honey and mustard as i haven’t seen that in other recipes. I think any hard salty cheese can be used in place of feta - Parmesan and cotija both work. The resulting meal inspired total silence at the dinner table, which is always a good sign!

I did not use Feta (no dairy for me) in the sauce nor Dijon in either the marinade or the sauce. I added Huacatay to the marinade and another clove of garlic.   The marinade is so good that I plan to make a few more batches to share with my foodie friends. I think it would work well on grilled skirt steak or grillled prawns as well.

I had to broil for a few minutes at the end to get a darker color, mine was not nearly as lovely a shade as  the picture.  I used 2 large jalapenos in the sauce rather than 4. Overall, very good, deep smoky flavor, and not too spicy for my kids.

Served it with roasted butternut squash tossed with olive oil, cumin, garlic and pasilla chili powder. Definitely a keeper. I'm going to try the marinade on salmon then grill it.

- **Comment Body:** My mom is genetically averse to cilantro, but I have found that some parsley with a splash of lemon juice will get you the bright freshness of cilantro, if not the exact flavor.  I have also had success doing a partial substitution, replacing most of the cilantro with the parsley/lemon mixture, but keeping just a pinch of cilantro in there to nudge your brain into thinking it's all cilantro. It's not enough to impart that "soapy" flavor to the whole dish, but you still get the spirit of it.

- **Comment Body:** I made this a few days ago. First I did it per the recipe exactly. It was good but lacking punch. Next time, I did a few things differently that resulted in a far superior dish:  1) use more of nearly every ingredient of the marinade, in particular the two Aji chili pastes. I think "heaping tablespoon" is more appropriate than what is written. Also twice as much salt.  2) add in a splash of dark soy sauce. Helps a ton with color and browning

- **Comment Body:** Outrageous! The sauce alone was worth the effort, good enough that I may make just the sauce again. Followed the recipe exactly, including using ají amarillo and ají panca (available from Amazon). I did make one small change, namely quartering the chicken (which is how we normally serve it). I used my wand blender to make the sauce and the marinade, which worked well. And I marinated the chicken in a sealable plastic bag. Cooking time was spot on.

- **User Display Name:** Charlie
- **Comment Body:** Insanely good, and super easy to boot. Since half my family has the cilantro-soap problem, I subbed a mix of parsley and basil. I also used only 1 jalapeño since they aren’t as spice-tolerant as me, and also because the two spice pastes were pretty hot already. It was definitely worth seeking out the Peruvian pastes, they have unique flavors. I served it with pretty simple roasted potatoes, thinking that there would be plenty of sauce to spare, and I was not disappointed!

Made the sauce right after the marinade and let the flavors meld for several hours while the chicken marinated. The sauce was divine. This will become a part of our regular rotation.

I ordered the aji amarillo and panca pastes from amazon.  I eventually ordered aji amarillo powder as well. I like using goat cheese and feta crumbles in the sauce (which is absolutely fantastic).  I also dont pat dry the chicken before the oven.  I just cook for 20 min so the marinade will dry then brush with olive oil. awesome recipe!

Not only will you find what you are looking for, but you will discover a whole New World of spices, cheeses and other wonders like Latin American Coca-Cola. Unlike its North American counterpart, it is sweetened with cane sugar, arguably making it much tastier. Enjoy!

Hubby roasts them on the grill and it is so much more flavorful to me than raw. Love both recipes, tho - - just two different takes.

So, if you want to maintain some olive oil flavor (albeit less than EVOO) and lower the risk of smoke, you could try regular olive oil instead.  (See oliveoil.com for a list of smoke points for different oils.)

Follow photo for serving:  1) Cut each breast crosswise. 2) Nestle a bowl of sauce among the chicken pieces. 3) Include a small dish (cazuela) of sauce on individual plates, for dipping. Beautiful!

I can see using them on tons of things in the future. I used all drumsticks for the chicken and they turned out perfect. The garlic had a hard time staying on so next time, will try paste maybe. Also, the sauce was epic, using it on some chops tonight - bright, herbal but the feta adds a new level of YUM.

I left everything whole since it was going to be strained anyway. Instead of garlic chips, I threw on some crispy (store-bought) shallots which eliminated a step.

They're also a must-have in a plethora of specific dishes, so they're great to keep on hand.

Or, perhaps, consider a recipe that makes mashed potatoes as a casserole, so all you have to do is reheat in the oven. (with some buttery panko and fresh herbs on top!)

- **Comment Body:** For the roasted garlic: 60 minutes at 380 cannot be beat, it comes out creamy and sweet (not at all burnt at the ends like mine has at 400).  If you are putting in the effort to roast garlic, you might as well make extra. Seasoned with salt and pepper before roasting, food processed with extra olive oil to taste, it becomes a delicious spread you can add to almost anything and lasts about a week in the fridge (much longer if frozen into cubes).

- **Comment Body:** This is a great recipe for savory  mashed potatoes. You can up the flavor of this dish by saving the olive oil from cooking the garlic chips and adding it to the mash - which makes this triple garlic mashed potatoes. Another easy flavor boost is to add a few cloves of garlic to the potato water and cook along w the potatoes - mash them in with everything else and you get quadruple garlic mashed potatoes. A perfect bed for Melissa Clark's Mushroom Bourguignon.

But, I'm also developing a theory about recipes, i.e., that some are overly complex for the resulting flavor.  This one got me thinking that way.  It's good, certainly, but it was also very time-consuming.  And, just good; not Wow! good.

- **Comment Body:** Like so many NYT Food recipes where I have all the ingredients on hand, I had to try it this morning.  I believe in respecting the recipe and making it as described before I make adjustments.  I made it as described but halved it for just me.  I used a well seasoned cast iron pan.  The eggs were fluffy, creamy and delicious, just like I imagine royalty get from their 5-Star chefs.  I'll play with it now to reduce the amount of butter to protect my arteries like a Weight Watchers chef.

If you wanted to use a little less butter, you probably could be ok, but it's really good with the butter.  I made two eggs-- cut the recipe in half and it worked. (I also added a few chopped onions at the end if anyone is interested)

- **Comment Body:** Good eggs! I doubled the recipe. Corn starch added no flavor. Served with English muffins to wife and kids. Plates cleaned! I think a lot of reviewers are missing the point; it's a technique to get fluffy eggs, quickly.  Like many of the reviewers, my usual eggs use only salt and butter, and turn out nicely, but I need low heat and constant stirring. At larger quantities that can be 15 minutes. This recipe gives me more grace, with quicker cook time.

I, too, have been making eggs for multiple decades, and in my experience, this technique produces scrambled eggs that are at least a couple of steps above the norm, with less time/effort than the very-low-heat method. For those of you who are set in your egg technique, please move along -- nothing to see here (and no need to comment). But for those open to improvement, I say give this a try.

- **Comment Body:** This recipe is unnecessarily complicated.  I have been making scrambled eggs for 60 years; it was the first thing I learned how to cook by myself when I was 7 years old.  Scramble the eggs (now I use chopsticks - they mix the whites and yolks more thoroughly); heat butter in a pan; add eggs and move them gently around the pan with a spatula as they cook.  Turn off the heat before the eggs are completely set and slide them onto a plate.  They are fluffy and creamy and yummy.

- **Comment Body:** I use more-or-less the same technique - but I mix the eggs with a little milk in a jug before adding them to the melted butter in the pan. Cooking the eggs takes less than 5 mins - the trick, as you write, is to remove them from the heat before they are completely set, as they continue cooking in their own heat. Overcooking them (a matter of seconds!) is what kills the creaminess...

I skipped the cold butter in the eggs, made my slurry with whole milk and used less than 1 TB butter in the pan.  A revelation! Delicious, creamy, soft, tasty eggs - I am a convert. The volume seemed larger too. So much easier than my old method of cooking a long time over low heat and periodically moving pan off heat.  Try it haters!  You just may be surprised!

The butter and slurry were prepped in the time it took the pan to heat up, so no extra time at all.  The eggs were easy, and far fluffier and creamier then my usual efforts, even those made with a bit of milk. Super delicious and definitely will be the method going forward.

- **Comment Body:** The primary benefit of the cubed cold butter is that it significantly increases the "holdability" of the eggs. So if you're going to wolf them down straight away, you probably don't need it as much. But if you're cooking for a crowd and would like to hold the eggs warm for 20 minutes, the butter makes all the difference. And as others have noted, this "higher heat" method does produce more volume than the low-and-slow method, no question.

- **Comment Body:** I don't disagree that it's possible to make amazing eggs without potato starch and butter and all that — but seriously, try this before you say that your eggs are perfect the way they are. You just might change your mind. And although it sounds like a hassle, it literally took me 90 seconds longer to prep than just making eggs the "usual" way. And to make it easier, it's not really necessary to cube all the butter — only half of it. The rest goes into the pan to foam, so  cubing not needed.

There was enough buttery glisten left on the serving plates that obviously didn’t didn’t absorb, that I think I can get way with that.

Just mix the eggs as usual, heat your pan as usual, add a little butter (1 tsp.) and a dash of olive oil. Once the pan is ready add MOST of the beaten eggs reserving a bit. When the eggs are nearly done add the remaining egg liquid, give a quick stir and serve.

Would probably cut down on the butter because it was a little too much for me, but the recipe was foolproof and got me fluffy, delicious eggs quicker than cooking on a low flame like the typical scrambled eggs recipe. Again, as other commenters said, don't comment on the recipe saying your method is better/less complicated if you didn't even try this. It's awesome!

- **Comment Body:** Followed the recipe to the T (not really that hard anyway) though used cornstarch. Came out absolutely perfect and my girlfriend who was very skeptical until the first bite was totally impressed!  The many steps might look laborious but it really comes together in about 5 minutes. Definitely worth it!

- **Comment Body:** Lovely recipe. I was never a big fan of quick egg items until I came across this. On my second attempt, I decided to spice it up a bit to satisfy my Bengali tongue. I just added a bit of black pepper powder and paprika in the mix, along with some mirepoix mix veggies. And it just got better. Toasted the breads on the skillet after the egg was done, so that's a good use of the buttery grease. With some blue cheese on the bread, turned out to be a satisfying meal on a weekday morning. :)

- **Comment Body:** I'm a fan of Kenji, I've been to chef school and cooked professionally (briefly), I respect the work of chefs, and I agree that if you haven't actually cooked this recipe just as he instructed you have no business criticizing it.  I just made this as instructed down to using potato starch and high-quality eggs from my own free-ranging Maran hens, and my opinion is that I would not make them again.  Just too heavy w butter for my taste, but they may be better on unbuttered toast or grits.

- **Comment Body:** This butter trick may be why cheesy scrambled eggs turn out so nicely (cheese added mid way, or early-ish). The same trick with the melting fat keeping parts cool.   On this basis, pre-grated cheese, which is bound often with potato starch, should work even better.

I followed the recipe but cut down for 2 eggs, and only used 1 tbsp of cold butter cut into 1/4" cubes per recipe. These eggs were the softest, fluffy and buttery, perfection. The addition of the corn starch was profound, I am converted to this technique.

- **Comment Body:** Prior to learning this clever technique of protecting the egg protein (from high heat) with a starch slurry, I did not really like scrambled eggs at all. And yes, I had made them the ways all the people discussing their supposed simpler alternative methods made them. What this ingenious recipe will make is something far more delicious and delicate that what you get with those other methods. It's not too much work- it's actually quite simple. Just give it a shot.

It is always made with potato starch called katakuriko for fluffiness and rise in making round omlette very much like this texture.

- **Comment Body:** I have been making delicious scrambled eggs for years and I agree with most of the advice in this recipe except one thing. No milk, cream, crème fraîche or even butter added to the eggs. I whisk in full fat sour cream. This makes for a deliciously fluffy scrambled egg with no chance of being watery or broken. Also, if you like a little cheese in your eggs, the sour cream binds to the cheese and the result is the flavor of the cheese without it separating from the egg.

- **Comment Body:** Been making scrambled eggs this way for years — perfect, foolproof scrambled eggs on the workweek breakfast table in about 2 minutes total. I do not add butter to the slurry— I use a tablespoon or less for the pan — but the more butter the creamier and more luscious the end product.  It’s chemistry folks.  The starch slows down the development of albumen, which is what Gordon Ramsay accomplishes by technique.  Don’t be tempted to increase the starch - a little does the trick.

Stirred in 2 chopped scallions, reserving some for sprinkling on afterwards. Was skeptical of the small amount of salt, but it was just right—any more would have masked the subtle richness of the beautiful pasture-raised eggs that I used. I don't know why anybody would kvetch—prep time really was nothing, and the process of cooking is half the enjoyment of eating!

- **Comment Body:** Being a Texan, I make guacamole frequently. The best way to prevent browning is to place saran wrap directly on the guac, allowing no air to touch it. I GUARANTEE if you follow other "tricks" it will still brown if you just stretch the saran wrap across the top of the serving bowl. Placing the plastic wrap directly on the guac and gently pressing it up the sides of the serving bowl will leave it just as green and pretty as when you first made it.

- **Comment Body:** My Mexican grandmother was very much a purist when it came to guacamole.  Avocado, onion, tomato and salt. And nothing else. Cilantro, especially, and even peppers and lime, in my opinion, cover the mild taste of the avocado.  The avocado becomes a vehicle for the other flavors rather than the main event. The key is the salt.  Too much and it's salty.  Too little and it's flat. When you hit it exactly right, your guests will say it's the best guacamole they have ever tasted.

They made it "table-side" at the restaurant. I do add a squeeze of lime juice at the end. But, be prepared. You're going to have to at least double the recipe if you have guests like those I do.

Just cut the avocado in half. The stone can be scoped out with a spoon. No need to make neat slices or cubes. Its all getting mashed anyway.Plastic warp pushed down to top of the Guac and up the sides of a bowl to remove as much air as possible keep sit fresh and bright.

- **Comment Body:** In my book lime juice is the third-most important ingredient after avocados and salt. I use a half lime per avocado. This recipe calls for too much cilantro and onion; while that amount makes sense for a restaurant, where they can't afford to be too picky about their avocados and therefore have to introduce bold flavors, the home cook can let the natural flavor of a good avocado shine through. Cayenne can be used instead of the chile. And use red onion and really ripe tomatoes, please.

The rest of the recipe remains about the same.  I have spent a lot of time in Mexico and never saw guacamole made without lime juice.

You're allowed to have your preference for adding citrus, but it is by no means essential to guacamole.

Also, you can add olive or avocado oil to the mix at your taste to improve consistency reduce oxidation and male it juicy! Enjoy!

Though I know it is standard in "fancy" cooking, seeding a tomato and in the process removing the juice takes out the best part, and it helps guacamole to leave that part in. Corn, never flour tortilla chips, and no packaged chips from the store.  Fresh fried from good tortillas de mais pnly.

I always pour a bit of evo on top of garlic to keep it together while chopping. Put onion and garlic in a bowl and start with 1/2 tsp salt. let it sit while you peel and halve avocado. Needs to be soft so a fork mashes it easy. Mix well & let sit 10 min. Season to taste w/ salt & pepper. Store w/plastic wrap on top to preserve.

I may try adding some toasted cumin seeds into the mortar next time to see what happens, but overall this recipe is very good as is.

- **Comment Body:** In a small family run restaurant in Mexico I watched a woman make guacamole to order for 45 minutes...I've got it down.I concur with using lime juice, adds flavor, and reduces oxidation.I scoop out each half of the avocado with a big spoon...saves time. I also mash my avocado. Other ingredients get minced. I like to use jalapenos, black pepper, pressed garlic, and prefer the white onion. I will also use scallions or red onions. Good corn tostaditos for dipping are a  must!

- **Comment Body:** The biggest trick to making good guacamole is having ripe but unblemished fruit.  I look for hard ones, because ripe ones are often bruised, either at store or on the way home.  Then I let them ripen on the counter (if I put them in the cabinet, I forget until too late). Alert: they ripen more quickly on warm days, so allow more time in the winter or in a cold house.We make guacamole with garlic, lime, cilantro, and kosher salt.  To taste!  Outstanding!

- **Comment Body:** To make New Mexico style quac just substitute a Hatch green chile (we prefer hot) for the Serano, add a clove or two of finely diced garlic, salt to taste, and the juice of a fresh squeezed lime. Let the juice sit on the top of the quac (this will prevent the avocado from turning brown) until ready to serve, then fold in and enjoy.

- **Comment Body:** You don't have to add a ton of lime, but I like a sprinkle. Mainly, I think that guacamole should be the way you like it, not the way you're told to make it. (Though making it once per instructions is an okay start.) Some tomato (without the juice)? Fine, if you like it. Fresh coriander? Fine if it doesn't taste like soap to you. (It does to some.) I have occasionally added some chopped pistachios. Traditional? Nope, but let your taste buds guide you. And you can vary your recipe--it's legal.

Absolutely fabulous! The strawberries were caramelized, and the cake had a beautiful color and texture. I will never use Julia’s clafoutis recipe again, and I intend to make my temp/timing mistake each time I bake this. Plus browning the butter added so much umami. Almost as good the next morning at room temp with coffee. A real keeper.

Expected this to be a little heavy and wet but it is the airiest cake - and also moist! Needless to say this came out great. Followed the recipe with some extras - grated fresh young ginger roots to the strawberry-sugar  mix, zested lemons and added 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla bean paste into the wet ingredients before adding the dry ingredients. Am in Bangkok. Will use ripe mangoes next time.

Cream intermingles with the cake, fruit, and sugar to make a golden-brown custard-y topping. We still had the ice cream.

I'd use 1 1/2 cups not 1 cup. Fourth, white flour is poison, I'd use whole wheat flour. Fifth. Salt is also poison and unnecessary. Sixth. The baking time is all wrong. More like 35-45 minutes.  Try making it this way and it will be much tastier and a whole lot healthier!

I have always needed to bake it for 30+ minutes. It stays visibly gooey in the middle.  I also found I preferred salted butter to unsalted. You could probably cut even more sugar and it would still be good. This is an extremely forgiving recipe, which I unforgivably botched once and still managed to fix and serve.

Lately, I've been trying the full family-serving versions of recipes and wasting a lot of hard-earned groceries in so doing. The mug version (or small pyrex bowl) I just made is very tasty - one loses any crispy edges of course - yet one gains greater control over the battery-ness of the batter.

Variation 4: brown the butter   add cardamom to taste into the batter (prob 1tsp or less; taste it-benefit of eggless batter.)  With any of these variations, use a biscuit cutter to mash the strawberries into the sugar. #clearlyaddicted

I have a second one baking right now to share with my parents tomorrow, and used frozen mix of strawberries, blueberries and mango. It’s a versatile and simple recipe I’ll use again!

- **Comment Body:** Made it vegan and it was delicious! Simple subs of Earth Balance butter and oat milk made it a delicious vegan dessert. Served with coconut whipped cream and everyone is in heaven. I also did 2/3 cups AP flour and 1/3 cup corn meal just because I love all things corn meal and it was great. Such an easy dessert that may be one of my favorites yet.

- **Comment Body:** I made 2 this morning.  One using suggestion below with rhubarb and strawberry, the other with peaches (fresh and skinned 2).  The strawberry rhubarb I cooked in a butter greased hot cake 8 inch pan and topped with freshly ground cardamom and vanilla sugar.  The peach one I added 1/4 cup wheat bran to batter and cooked it in an 8 inch cast iron skillet (hot from oven with melted butter to grease it).  I topped the peach with candied ginger and vanilla sugar.  Wonderful esp cast iron peach!

- **Comment Body:** I’ve made this with all different types and combos of frozen fruit. Frozen peaches with blueberries, blueberries and strawberries etc. I highly recommend 1T of lemon juice for any fruit combo other than Strawberry- this was a big hit! I also mix the wet ingredients and the dry ingredients ahead of time. Then just as everyone is serving dinner chuck it together and in the oven.

- **Comment Body:** Pure melt-in-your-mouth goodness. Ignore the naysayers and try making the cake with the original ingredients, no substitutions — a cobbler’s supposed to be a comforting treat! If you want a healthier dessert without “poisonous” white flour then you are welcome to just… eat fresh strawberries.  I’ve made this in a 8x8 square pan, in a 10-in cast iron skillet, and also tried splitting the batter into a small baking dish and a mini cocotte. Baking times didn’t change but shallower = crispy edges.

- **Comment Body:** Phenomenal!!!! It’s simply divine.  This was so, so delicious but so, so easy - the perfect combination.  We made while on vacation - when you want a homemade desert but are feeling lazy.  This could also be great when you are hosting someone and need something really quick.  It would be sure to impress.  You definitely need to serve this with the ice cream, though I think it could also be good with homemade whipped cream.  Basically, make this now!!!

- **Comment Body:** Doubled the berries, reduced the sugar very slightly (by about 2 Tbsp and could have reduced slightly more), and added 1/4 cup almond flour for a portion of the AP flour because I had it lying around. Fab. Next time I would add 1/2 tsp of vanilla.

- **Comment Body:** This is honestly the most delicious dessert I have ever had (truly), and so simple to make. Since discovering this recipe last summer (2020), I have made it many times. It just gets more delicious each time. Tip: use the best strawberries you can find! Driscolls will get the job done, but if you can find strawberries from a local farm during peak strawberry season, you will NOT believe how amazing the taste is. Also use more strawberries than the recipe calls for! And ice cream is a must. Enjoy.

Served warm with vanilla Häagen-Dazs ice cream - pure heaven!

- **Comment Body:** Happy to report that the cake survived the night, and now I'm eating it cold for breakfast. I might like it even more now, even without the ice cream. Agree that reducing the sugar and doubling the strawberries is the way to go.  Baked for 30 min. to get a really golden color. I also used browned butter for some extra nuttiness and my homemade vanilla sugar. Bonus points for minimal dirty dishes/low cleanup effort!

- **Comment Body:** recommend melting the butter in the pan while the oven is preheating (leaving a bit in the pan and putting the batter in the hot pan create a lovely chewy crust) and also increasing the amount of fruit which can be any juicy fruit - peaches, blueberries, etc.

- **Comment Body:** This is overall an excellent recipe. I made it this weekend and it turned out amazing. I could not be happier with the result. It was moist and super flavorful. Even though it calls for 2/3 cup brown sugar packed, I used 1/2 not packed. It was really good and perfectly sweetened. Even with the Vanilla Ice Cream on top, it was really good and it worked perfectly well with the cake/bread. I would definitely recommend that people who like to cook or bake make this. It is simple and very delicious.

- **Comment Body:** This was superb and easy and was nearly devoured by two of us!  I followed the suggestions of others and used a generous 2 cups of strawberries, and used dark brown sugar as well.  The finished result was tart and satisfying, and paired well with vanilla ice cream.  Like others, I don't think whipped cream has enough heft for this.  25 minutes of cooking time in an 8" square with a convection oven was perfect.
