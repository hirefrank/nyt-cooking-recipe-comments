- **Comment Body:** Didn’t find anyone using Bob’s Paleo flour but the raves were impossible to deny.  I don’t know if I’ve ever seen a recipe with more raves.  I tried it with BOBS PALEO FLOUR and IT WORKED.  I followed some other suggestions in the notes: (i) doubled the strawberries, (ii) used dark brown sugar but 1/4 cup for each part, (iii) used half and half instead of milk, (iv) added 1T vanilla paste to berries and (v) cooked for 50 minutes.  At this point, I’m desperately trying not to eat the whole thing

- **Comment Body:** Doubled the recipe to serve a group; it took much longer in the oven than I expected and I worried that it was still under done but it turned out perfectly. I used dark brown sugar because I didn’t have light and while the color was much darker and more caramelized than the photo as shown, it was a huge hit with my entire family. This one is definitely a keeper! I think it would work beautifully with stone fruits, plums, nectarines, or any kind of berries.

- **Comment Body:** I made this cake yesterday. Unfortunately, there was too much liquid after baking at 355F for 45 minutes. I followed some recommendations (put little cinnamon, shredded ginger, and lemon zest) and used 2 cups of strawberries. I also used 1 cup of organic whole wheat flour, instead of all-purpose flour. If anyone has wisdom about what might have happened, I would appreciate it.  It was too syrupy and did not like the consistency of the cake shown in the picture. Thanks in advance.

It was easy enough that she could make it alongside me with little help. batter looked sparse but was more than enough; used extra frozen strawberries (probably 1 1/2 x berries called for); 15 min extra was needed in oven as others noted. after dinner, I left the room briefly. When I returned my family had devoured the entire spoon cake! all of it! we will make this again!

Although strawberry is still my favorite. Like someone else posted - this is good enough to be devoured in a single sitting. If I have enough self control - two. My husband is not allowed any. Treat yourself and make it tonight.

My guests were complimentary but I found it did not at all meet expectations.  Perhaps because it was room temp rather than warm? Made it right before dinner which lasted quite a while.  So glad I had great ice cream to go with it.

We had it for breakfast with yogurt on top. The best recipe ever for the nearly tasteless strawberries one finds in supermarkets. (Suggestion: If you don't have time to bake, macerate supermarket strawberries in balsamic vinegar and serve over vanilla ice cream.)

It was delicious, but making it in a round 8” dish makes it a little deeper for a moister cake.  I made it with frozen blueberries and cherries, and I added nutmeg and cinnamon since it’s October.  Next time I’ll do sour cherries and experiment with lemon zest.

It’s a great way to use them when they’re starting to get soft or overripe, or if I buy a batch that has a lot of bruised and be. I’m sure I e made this with other berries too, and I know I’ve made it with peaches. It’s my favorite summer dessert.

Or more simply, just mix with water and sesame oil.

- **User Display Name:** Prakash Nadkarni
- **Comment Body:** @Euphemia: To add to my previous note: Traditionally, the crisp rice layer is produced by placing the rice in a fairly heavy and very hot (e.g., oven-heated) stone/ceramic serving bowl, pressing the rice down to ensure good thermal contact. The bowl, whose material has high specific heat, yields its heat to the rice layer sustainedly.  This technique requires some care by both the cook and the diner not to burn themselves: the low-slow method, used in Iranian chelo rice, avoids this risk.

- **Comment Body:** This is a really interesting recipe! In response to another comment pointing out how the browned, crusty rice in bibimbap is made, transitional Korean cooking doesn’t use oven. It’s all done on a stove top, in a thick stone pot for that delicious browned rice on the bottom - called nooroongji. I grew up in Korea and I didn’t start using my oven regularly years into moving to US. But this recipe seems brilliant. I’m all for seeing recipes that mix different cuisines and techniques.

- **Comment Body:** @Euphemia - You're right that a quick steam (or microwaving) would separate the clumps of leftover rice into separate grains. But Step 3's heating the resultant rice in a sheet pan for 3-6 minutes to set the egg whites would not produce crisp rice crust, if that's your intention. Crust formation, a combination of caramelization (mostly) plus Maillard reaction, requires slow (20 min+) and low (3/10 on an electric stovetop) heat using a non-stick or oiled/buttered pan.

- **Comment Body:** Eggs cooked on a sheet pan are actually really good. I add the egg(s) for the last 5 min or so of roasting. The pan is already hot so it doesn’t run and the quality of the sheet pan cooked egg is superb because of the heat on both sides. The best, honestly. Just test the cooking time obviously, learn your oven for this. Mine would probably eviscerate kale at 450 for that long , on topic of oven varieties LOL

Made Maangchi's "vinegared soy-hot pepper paste seasoning sauce". Crisping the rice was a huge favorite - made a big pot of brown rice in the pressure cooker then spread it out immediately on a hot sheet pan where it crisped wonderfully. Served with kimchi and cucumbers and some shredded raw cabbage with lime & gochugaru.

- **Comment Body:** Although not traditional, this sounds interesting.  Having said that, I'd point out that bibimbap is mixed with gochujang sauce, not straight up gochujang.  Gochujang sauce has mixture of sugar,  garlic, vinegar and for me, mirin.  If you don't want to make it, you can purchase ready made bibimbap sauce pretty easily at Korean supermarkets.  Just keep it in the fridge like ketchup and whenever you like, add it to a bowl of rice.  Even with just a fried egg and sesame oil, it's pretty good.

Half of my Korean family prefers the sauce and the other half will always opt for straight gochujang. Of course, if you want to go with simple gochujang, it helps to have smooth home-made gochujang instead of the BRICK that I've had in my fridge forever.

Then I can avoid cooking the rice and eggs in a sheet pan and just crisp the rice in a heated cast iron and quickly fry the eggs in a nonstick pan instead.   Also making the gochujang sauce someone else recommended was definitely worth it over thick paste form.

None of them heard of crispy rice in bibimbap, but they all could see the advantages of using dry heat to reheat cooked rice and keep if from becoming a soggy starchy mess.  Took the advice of one and thinned the gojuchang with the recommended ingredients (thanks!).  This recipe is not supposed to be photo-shoot quality, and that is both its charm and its flavor.

I thinly sliced some ribeye and tossed it in a marinade of soy sauce, sesame oil, salt, pepper, ginger, garlic and put that on yet another pan (also ready at 25 min mark). I mixed the gochujang with sesame oil, rice vinegar, and a little bit of water as suggested.

- **Comment Body:** Really tasty! Some tips: 1. More mushrooms. 2. Cook the sweet potatoes, mushrooms, onion on one large pan, the kale on a second pan. Don’t do the kale for 20-25 min at 450 unless you want to set off the smoke alarm (been there, done that). Once you take the kale out, re-use that pan for the rice (precooked in a rice cooker) and eggs. 3. Don’t stress about the gochujang comments. I was able to find this pretty easily at the grocery store in a paste & it was delicious as is.

- **Comment Body:** Good flavors! But the procedures described in this recipe are problematic.   — Don’t slice the sweet potatoes and onions too thin. They’ll cremate in a 450 oven at 20 minutes.   — I thought the “crunchy bits” in the baked leftover rice were unpleasant bits of burnt stuff. Next time, I’ll just mix in cooked rice.   — Watch the baking eggs carefully; they’ll overcook in a second. Really, that procedure is pointless; just fry the eggs on the stovetop.

Roasted the kale but sauteed the mushrooms and cubes of firm tofu. I also par-cooked the sweet potato before slicing into half moons and roasted those. To give the veggies and tofu more flavor, I made a Korean-style sauce of soy sauce, sesame oil, mirin, and sliced green onion and drizzled on. Also, made omelet and sliced into strips along with strips of gim.

And if your gochujang is too thick just mix it with a little hot water.

In my oven, 25 minutes at 450°F leaves the chicken beautifully brown and juicy. A layer of aluminum foil will help keep the pan clean. Try spreading some of the marinade in the pan before adding the chicken. Move the chicken pieces around to coat the bottoms, then pour the rest of the topping over the skin sides.

Instead of green olives alone, consider a mix of olives of different colors, including some kalamata, crushed and pitted. Bearing in mind that the parsley is going to wilt, not cook, add to it some fresh basil leaves, or some dried herbs, like thyme, tarragon, or marjoram. Any of these changes will play well with the chicken and turmeric.

- **Comment Body:** To make this a complete one pan meal I added halved small potatoes to the pan and served it on top of several leaves of lettuce (Boston or bib). Chicken and potatoes cooked the same time and the sauce served as the dressing. I agree with the comments to add lemon and I will Also cut back on the olive oil next time. Turmeric doesn’t provide much more than color. Maybe a nice substitute will be paprika.

Served with buttered, parsley egg noodles and a spring mix salad with balsamic vinaigrette. Fed 6 adults and 6 kids and it was absolutely gobbled up. Spectacular, hands-off dish.

- **Comment Body:** The olive/parsley mixture creates a vinaigrette when added to the pan juices, but a way better vinaigrette because of the chicken fond.  We served it with warm, crusty sourdough and dipped the bread in the sauce on the platter until it was gone.  I cut up a whole chicken, removed the back, and cut the bone-in chicken breasts in half.  I put the back on the pan to get extra flavor for the sauce.  The special sauce for this recipe won’t happen with boneless, skinless chicken breasts.

Something called to me and I needed to give this a shot.  The flavor bombs from the pan chicken juices/drippings were incredible, but instead of a adding lot of those juices onto my plate, I chose to let the olives speak, leaving most of the juices in the pan.  PLENTY flavor filled, from tossing the olives with the pan juices.   Alison Roman is a Goddess.

After spreading on the hot pan, pop the pan back in the oven for one minute. The olives soften, the garlic warms up and starts to golden, the parsley wilts just a bit, all sitting in the chicken fat bubbling. If you are nodding your head that this sounds like a great idea, it is, give it a try and get that last 1% of wonderful

Removed from pan and then threw in all the elements of the sauce. Scraped up the brown bits, reduced and then poured a little over each thin sliced breast. A little rice to mop up this fab sauce et voilà! A really tasty, minimal fuss, weeknight dinner.

The skin was crisp and delicious, the olive and parsley topping just the right amount of salty and bright. Will definitely make it again.

My husband couldn't stop raving about how delicious it was. I cooked the chicken for 25 minutes and it was perfect...not at all dry. I didn't have any parsley.

- **Comment Body:** After 4 tries I got a better result tonight with the following: instead of just pouring the vinegar over the chicken at the start, I poured just enough of the vinegar into the baking dish along with the salt, bit of oil, the turmeric and also some other spices to make a slurry at the bottom. I then just laid the seasoned chicken on top of this. Later, when making the parsley-garlic-oil mix, I added additional vinegar which also helped to further deglaze. The slurry helped concentrate the flavor.

But I happen to have a very large pan that moves easily from stovetop to oven. So I dusted with a little flour, added seasonings and sautéed to give it a little crispness. Then baked. I finished off with a tiny hint of broiling and a squirt of lemon juice before serving. This is a wonderful, easy instant classic. Highly recommend!

- **Comment Body:** This was absolutely delicious. I have to confess, as much as I believe it's best to just follow the recipe before trying any variations, that I didn't trust that the chicken would be tender after just 30 minutes at 450, so after 20 mins I lowered the oven to 375 and cooked for a further hour. It was super moist and fell off the bone, and the sauce was gorgeous. I will probably make this every week for the rest of my life (and maybe one of those weeks I'll try following the recipe as written)...

(Combine olive oil, turmeric, s&p, then rub it on and beneath the skin. Brown the chicken in olive oil, remove from pan, add garlic, deglaze with vinegar and chicken broth, add olives, return chicken to pan, cook til done, finish with parsley.)

When I was taught this method, salted capers soaked in cold water overnight were used with the olives. Over the years, I’ve added fresh herbs-oregano & rosemary when I make it. They are chopped very fine and added to the olive mix before mixing with the pan juices.

Add an equal amount of sliced asparagus to the pasta water. When the pasta is al dente and the asparagus is crisp tender, lightly drain. Remove the chicken from its pan and keep warm. Pour the olive mixture into this oven pan to deglaze the bottom adding water if necessary. Toss in the pasta. Then plate with the chicken on top. Elegant!

- **Comment Body:** Did you also cut your baking sheet size in half? If not, the amount of material on the sheet might not yield the proper result but instead exactly what you describe: a burnt coating. I'm using a European size oven with reduced quantities *plus* I will need to use something other than a baking sheet — partly because of the size but also because the "baking sheet" I have available is not flat. I am considering a large cast iron pan instead and keeping an eye on the liquid content as it cooks.

- **Comment Body:** It was fine. Tasty, even. But not the revelation it's made out to be. It reminds me of the "Mississippi Roast" hype from a few years ago.  I followed the recipe exactly. I suggest cutting large breasts in half so that they'll be done the same time as the dark meat.

- **Comment Body:** It was wonderful. I am guessing it might even be better if you make it, let it sit with the olive sauce covering the chicken and keep it warm for 15-20 minutes before serving. The flavors were terrific. VERY EASY

- **Comment Body:** I made two small changes; I marinated the chicken for about 30 minutes in the vinegar/turmeric/oil mixture, and I used champagne vinegar because it's what I had. I used wings and thighs and this recipe was INCREDIBLE. I also marinated tiny potatoes with the chicken and roasted them in the turmeric sauce (cooking for one, I had plenty), and sauteed green beans with shallots as a side. This is getting added to my weekly rotation!

- **User Display Name:** JanisV
- **Comment Body:** Made this for the second time tonight - so good! The only step I added was to pop the chicken back in the hot oven (on a clean sheet pan, leaving the sauce on the other) to crisp it up. It had kinda steamed instead of roasted, probably due to my schmaltz-loving decision not to trim any fat from the thighs. There ended up being A LOT of liquid, so crisping didn’t happen. Worked a treat to toss it back in for 10 minutes.

- **Comment Body:** Love Alison and was excited to try this "famous" recipe, but was honestly a bit disappointed. Followed recipe exactly, and didn't skimp on the salt. The chicken was quite bland; the vinegar/turmeric didn't add any flavor. The olive mixture is simple and good if your olives are good, but it didn't really emulsify with the rendered fat/leftover olive oil, and the sauce ended up being overly oily and raw tasting. Not sure where I went wrong?

I have been searching for a jar of olives already crushed and pitted, but haven’t had any luck.  The green Castlevetro olives were perfect in this recipie as they are mild enough, even for non-olive-lovers.

- **Comment Body:** This turned out really well. Stuck to the recipe, except doubled the turmeric per another comment. Cut up whole chicken but went boneless w/ the breast. When you mix the olives, garlic, and parsley into the pan juices, everything becomes very fragrant, and quite beautiful on the platter. With oven @ 450 a pan of roast veggies was a good match.   Never used Castelvetrano olives before. $6 at grocery store, but Costco has a large jar for only $8.

A lot of artichokes.  It's tasty but it was not stupendous when I followed the directions exactly. Artichokes added flavor.

It is what it is and it’s delicious and not in need of any changes. 25 mins at 450° with turmeric, salt, pepper and vinegar works. Parsley, garlic, water and olive oil  with crushed castelvetrano olives works. Add them together and you’ve got chicken perfection. Nothing else needs be said.

- **Comment Body:** SUPERB!  For crispier chicken, season the chicken with salt, pepper, and 1 tsp of baking powder and let sit for 20 minutes. To avoid the turmeric “washing off” when pouring the vinegar, whisk the turmeric and 2 tbsp of olive oil as you would a salad dressing in a medium bowl.  Drop the chicken into the bowl and coat each piece thoroughly, letting sit for about 30 minutes.  Also, put your sheet pan over a burner on low heat when bringing the olive sauce together.  Longer prep time, but worth it!

I made the dish exactly as written, and although I enjoyed it, I felt the garlic was overpowering, mostly because for all in tense and purposes, if was raw. The next day, I sauted half a sliced onion in butter until softened, a cup of chicken broth, 1/2 lemon juice w/zest and red pepper flakes and simmered briefly. The modified dish was delicious over rice. A keeper!

Next time would do a day ahead if possible. 2. baked for 30 minutes, last five on convection bake to crisp up. I used a mix of chicken thighs and breasts (that I cut in half). Served with mashed potatoes, would be great with rice or bread, anything to soak up the delicious sauce.

Hint: use gloves to marinate and move the turmeric chicken or you'll be golden for days.  I put the olives, garlic, cilantro (subbed for parsley) and water in the food processor,  omitting the additional olive oil as there was plenty of schmaltz. Will make again

Should I have mixed an acid with the olive mixture?  The olives were purchased at a local organic type market.  Purchased pre-pitted.  Dull flavor. Any thoughts?  Capers?  Olives packed in vinegar?

(I also had bone in skin on breasts only). My daughter doesn't like olives, so added some capers to the olive mixture.  Only other change was zest and juice of one lemon with the pan sauce.  Really easy and good.  I will try sheet pan next time.

- **Comment Body:** Interesting. I've been making this just for myself with one chicken thigh, so I've been eyeballing the topping ingredients. I've had to use mostly Kalamata olives since I haven't been able to find the Castelvetrano in the store where I live, but I've cut the amount to allow for the stronger taste. I've loved it.  But tonight I made it for three, and found that it wasn't as bright as it was for one, probably because of the extra schmaltz. I see now why some people recommended adding some lemon.

- **Comment Body:** This is an excellent recipe - I add more turmeric, garlic powder and vinegar. To the olive mix I add lemon juice and zest and once the chicken is browned in the oven and add the olive mix, I pop a couple of knobs of butter in and really let it simmer and emulsify into a gravy. Takes about 20 mins longer but worth the extra wait,  I serve with buttered rice and steamed green beans. Even my 3 year old loves it. Winner winner chicken dinner.

- **Comment Body:** I'd recommend putting some minced garlic and sliced mushrooms into the butter and chili crisp combo and sauté over medium heat for around 30 seconds (do not brown garlic). Heat the cream and melt a dollop of gorgonzola into it before adding it to the butter, garlic and mushrooms (and go easy on the gorgonzola since you don't want it to dominate the entire dish).

- **Comment Body:** This tastes like a decadent dish you'd pay a lot for in a restaurant. I diluted the heavy cream  a bit: 1/2 half and half, 1/2 heavy cream. Next time I will toss in some more spinach. I added garlic slices while sautéing the butter/chile crisp. Next time I will add mushrooms as well. Definitely add chile crisp on top when plating the dish - SO good!

They have several different types and spice levels so if you're unfamiliar, just start with their original.  After awhile, you'll use it like Americans do ketchup or ranch dressing....at anytime, on anything, anywhere, breakfast, lunch and dinner.  :-)

Increase heavy cream to 1.25 cups. Lots of spinach, the dish will easily accomodate 10 or up to 16oz - this makes for more of a meal.  Parmesan cheese increase to 3 oz plus more. Change steps, drain pasta (reserve water), pasta quickly back to pan, add spinach and pasta water to wilt and stir. Add cream mixture and stir. Mixes easier.

My regular grocery store didn't have it in the Asian aisle but Whole Foods had 3 different options.  I bought one made in my home state, for $10 (Cin Soy brand).  The other two were both higher.  I don't see a way to share a pic of the jar though.  It's sold in the center of the store, refrigerate after opening.

Silk whipping cream and 1/2 c. half and half. It totally worked as a delicious low-carb, lower fat hack.

Basically I would have small patches of sugar with the rest ending up on the bottom of the roasting pan.I experimented a bit and now I add a small amount of cider vinegar to the salt/sugar combo.  It forms a nice paste that stays in place and forms a nice lacquer.   I also used water and various liquors but landed on the vinegar as the best.

This could account for the differing results. I know the time I didn't use Diamond Crystal salt, my bo ssam was nearly inedible. They say:1 tsp. table salt = 1.5 tsp.Morton Kosher salt = 2 tsp. Diamond Crystal salt

- **Comment Body:** I've made this twice, once as written (but halved) and another in a slow cooker. The slow cooker was better, so sharing if it's helpful: 3.5 pound boneless shoulder. Halved salt in initial rub (i.e. 1/6c salt to 1/3c sugar for 3.5 pds), 12 hrs. Browned sides in a pan over medium heat, ~1-2m each side. Slow cooker on low for 7 hrs. Finished as written. Suggestion to add apple cider vinegar to brown sugar worked great. Previously, it all ran off and burned, setting off smoke alarms.

- **Comment Body:** This is my third time making this dish, and all three times it's been received rapturously (really, who can argue with candied crackling and fork tender meat?). The recipe as it is, is amazing. But my favourite hack so far is using radicchio instead of the bibb lettuce. The bitterness of the radicchio is great with the salty-porkiness and zingy condiments.

- **Comment Body:** It's the same cut of meat. Pork shoulder is also called Pork Butt or Boston Butt. Living in Boston for a number of years, I always just took this interchangeability for granted, but a quick search reveals that the term 'butt' originates from the wooden casks, called butts, that were used to encase the cheaper off-cuts of meat for storage or shipment around the time of the American Revolution, and not the anatomy of the animal. So there you go!

- **Comment Body:** I've made this several times now, but instead of the ssam sauce I mince fresh hot chilies (Thai or habaneros) & raw garlic and let them sit in a mixture of rice wine vinegar, salt, & sugar for a couple hours.  (I also like to make Japanese-style cucumber salad -- tastes great in the wrap!) Also, I rinse the salt/sugar off the pork and cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil for the slow roast. That way, I don't have to baste, and I don't get a hard-to-clean mess. :)

One of our favorite ways to use up the leftovers is to mix some ramen noodles with the pork and the scallion ginger sauce and top with a poached egg and the ssam sauce. Absolutely delicious! We have also done similar with leftover rice that we stir fry. Can't go wrong with this recipe the day you make it or with leftovers!

I also added a tablespoon of 5 spice powder.  It cooked exactly as written, with one small exception: I added some water to the roasting pan because I wasn't getting enough drippings at first.  The pork was perfect, falling apart as I lifted it out of the pan.  Would definitely cook this again!

Next time I will save my manicure and use a heavy duty disposable pan with a quarter sheet rack inside (the deep carmelization on the pork was also on my roasting pan and quite the chore to clean). For sublime lettuce, try my grandmother's trick: After washing and air-drying on paper towels, place in a cotton pillowcase and tuck in the fridge a few hours.

I'd love to experiment with the salt/sugar cure--maybe add some 5-spice powder? Also used doubled-up disposable pans the second time, because clean-up in a heavy roasting pan was a challenge.

I used two disposable pans, one as a pan the other as a lid, saved me the constant basting. Take off the lid for last 2hrs for color. Finish w/ brown sugar at 500°F as instructed.

- **Comment Body:** Lots have asked whether you can make this dish in a slow cooker or pressure cooker and of course the answer is yes -- you're applying heat and humidity, under pressure or not, for long enough to collapse the meat. But that's a braise not a roast and you're not going to get good "crust" out of the skin. You're going to end up with a floppy glove of it that's not going to candy-up the way it will if you follow the original recipe. So I'd do it as written.

I push the meat down to expose more of the meat, add some of the juices to the brown sugar mix to make a paste, and then brush the brown sugar mix like icing all over the top.  It was terrific!  The brown sugar worked its way through the meat without overpowering the top, and there was no charred brown sugar.

- **Comment Body:** A slow cooker works great for the first step. The butt will be incredibly moist and tender.  Cook for eight to ten hours on 'slow' depending on size.  A couple of suggestions. First, secure the pork butt with kitchen twine before placing in the slow cooker.  Doing so makes it easier to transfer to a roasting pan for step two.  Second, a slow cooker won't work for step two.  Transfer the slow-cooked butt to a roasting pan and finish in oven per directions above.

Do not rub off.  He says to cover pan with foil/baste every hr. I took off foil for about last 45 min or so to brown a bit as covered it looks anemic.  For the final sugar rub,  you use degreased pan drippings and combine with sugar.  No smoke at 500 deg finish.  Added Persian cucumber salad to accompaniments So Delish.

It took almost 6 hours to cook, so a larger butt might take longer? (I cooked it to 200 degrees internal, as for BBQ.)It didn't get too smoky, but the pan was coated with char and ash. As someone noted, disposable foil pans would be a great idea. This is pretty much a perfect recipe. We did have leftovers, which will go on tacos tonight.

I also ended up broiling it for a little bit at the very end to get the perfect texture. I cooked it at about 225 for almost 10 hours using a meat thermometer to monitor the internal temperature. The most labor intensive part of this dish by far was the cleaning and dicing of all the scallions. Well worth it though. The meat was everything one could want. Sweet, tender and juicy!

Two ideas: 1. salt needs more time to season interior  meat of a large roast, so rub with  .5 tsp kosher salt per pound of meat 48 hours before cooking, and cut the salt in the sugar/salt step in the recipe. 2. The dish takes beautifully to a little smoke, so you can either start or do the hot finish using indirect heat on a kettle grill, with some apple wood. Crisping up with the brown sugar in a hot kettle grill also saves mess and burt sugar smell in kitchen.

Here are a couple of things to know (thank you other reviewers): • You are not meant to use all of the initial rub, just as much as is needed to cover the meat, which turns out to be about half. I didn't brush any of it off before cooking. The top of the roast is good salty-sweet and the interior is not at all too salty. So half turns out to be perfect.

Save 2 TBs wet cure + 6 TB brown sugar for final crust, + vinegar or pickling liquid for a paste.  Cook over 'rack' of celery /carrot/onions. When start basting, add water to pan to keep juices from crusting and ease clean up.In addition to sauces , rice, lettuce, can add the roasted veg and do a quick pickled daikon/ carrot .

I have made it several times for friends, family, and out of the country family, that hail from the capital of the "carnitas" epicenter in Mexico and know a great pork dish.  I did not add salt to the last sugar caramel step, since it was salty enough.  The sauces are a must, if you're doing "tacos". We serve with the lettuce, corn tortillas and an additional Asian/Mexican chile de arbol and sesame hot sauce.  Run to the grocery store and get the ingredients to make this!

### Recipe: Momofuku's Bo Ssam

- **Comment Body:** I’ve had bo ssam at Momofuku Ssam Bar several times. It is solid. This super simple recipe is all over the internet, so I was surprised at the lack luster average ratings and reviews.  As others have mentioned, the confusion comes in the very first step with the amount of kosher salt. It seems most chefs use diamond crystal brand, which due to the crystal structure is much less salty. So if you use a different salt, cut the amount in half. Do not scrape the mixture off before cooking. Enjoy!

- **Comment Body:** No wiping!!!  But must use Diamond Crystal Kosher salt; otherwise too salty. Have made this 3 times now, and it really is pork crack!  I think I may try the first part in the crock pot, per others' suggestion--will let y'all know how it goes. A bit trepidatious about messing with perfection, but would like to try, so perhaps I could make this and not be at all anxious about leaving the oven on all day.

- **Comment Body:** Instead of using the oven, I cooked the pork butt in an Instant Pot for 90 minutes on high pressure. In addition to the 90 mins of cooking time, it took approximately 30 mins to come to pressure and about an hour to release pressure naturally, so about 3 hours total to get the meat super tender. I also cut the 9lb pork butt in half, which was the perfect amount to feed four hungry adults.

- **Comment Body:** I have made this many times. I generally mix 1/2 cup each of kosher salt and regular sugar and rub it on the meat to make a thin coating. I discard the rest of salt/sugar mix if there is any left over. I do not rub it off when it goes in the 300F oven and it is not too salty. I put the brown sugar/salt on at the end and put it under the low broiler for a few minutes until the sugar bubbles. Do not walk away or you could easily ruin the dish at this point. EVERYONE LOVES IT!

- **Comment Body:** Try to cook at 300 for 8 or more hours, not the 6 stated in the recipe, at least if the pork butt is in the 10 lb range.  Keep the fat on top to let it drip through during the cooking process.  The final 500 degree cooking step is very important -- for both flavor (more sweetness to accompany the  saltiness in the meat underneath) and texture (crispiness to go with tenderness below).  Use rakiyo (Japanese pickled scallions) and spicy bread and butter pickles for additional accompaniments.

Cook without wiping, save 2 tablespoons of the wet cure at the bottom of the bowl and + 6 tbs brown sugar for the final crust- add a little cider vinegar or pickling juice to help it stick if needed. Add water to the pan when start basting at an hour and minimal cleanup.Quick pickled carrot/ daikon is a great additional side.

Covered the pan with foil, while roasting, to keep it moist. Added 2 tsp cider vinegar to sugar mixture in step 6, which helped it to adhere and develop a beautiful, tasty crust. Also de-fatted and saved the drippings for future use.

Because of y'all, I used apple cider vinegar to make a paste, lined the pan with foil, and halved the sugar/salt rub (don't remove excess). So here I am, paying it forward: do all of those things, and accompany with sushi rice specifically. That's it. A miraculous meal. Happy New Year.

That way, you get the best of the delicious crust and not so much fat when you use it.  I start with lettuce tacos then move to tortillas later in the week.  The sauces and finishing at 500 are a must.

- **Comment Body:** This is excellent for feeding a crowd. Even though the recipe did not specify it, I wiped off all the excess cure (there was a lot) before roasting. I added a little grated ginger, garlic and crushed star anise to the cure as well for a little flavour boost. A fan-forced low oven at 150 celcius, was syill quite hot, as it burnished it a deep brown two hours into the cook. So cover it if you are worried about scorching the sugar early on. Condiments were very delicious and made the dish.

The sauce is better with less oil, more like a loose salsa. Toasted sesame seeds for next time--6 hours at 275 was plenty of time. I got the caramelized bark without the brown sugar step, so I skipped that--It's crazy delicious

I highly recommend buying the pork from a reputable butcher or from a Whole Foods. It may be 3X more expensive (about $40), but the quality and marbling of the pork was phenomenal. Finally, separate the fat from the juices and pour it on the dryer pieces of pork. Very flavorful!

I adjusted the seasonings and sides and was still completely eaten out of the house by 13 people.   Next time I will make 4x the sauces, definitely let the roast sit outside to cool to make it easier to add brown sugar crust, and I’ll try that tip of adding cider vinegar to make the brown sugar stick.  Served simple noodles in broth afterwards

It was also plenty salty. The NYT article talks about the "skin" puffing up in the last cooking. My roast had no skin, only a layer of fat. I didn't know to ask for the skin to be left on since the recipe doesn't mention that. It was fantastic with no skin and just the fat layer which renders and just leaves a crisp top.

As everyone says, scallion ginger sauce is made for this roasted pork. Ssam sauce good but overshadowed by scallion ginger. Bibb lettuce very nice.

Started in the slow cooker @212F (high on mine) for four hours while I ran errands, then finished in the oven @300F until collapsed.   The ginger scallion sauce seemed dry, so I halved the ratio of scallions to the rest of the recipe. Also, had to triple the quantity of it (7.5 c of scallions, x6 the rest). It is like crack. Need to keep a supply in the fridge for hubby now.   Can’t really mess this up.

I used a 4-5 lb roast for 4 people - took off a bit of the excess salt and sugar prior to cooking in a Dutch oven (no cover) at 300 F for 5-6 hours, then with the brown sugar rub for 15-20 minutes at 475 F. The braising might not be needed, but I checked every hour for scorching and had to add a bit of water to the bottom of the pan. You do NOT need any extra spices in the rub - just salt and sugar and pork. The sauces (the GREEN ONOIN SAUCE!!) have a TON of flavor.

- **Comment Body:** The meat itself, you could pair with any decent red that you like with a roast.  The trick here is the garnishes.  Strong Asian flavors, delightful yes, but finding a wine is tricky.  Kimchee and the scallion-ginger sauce seem to want a crisp, non-oaky white like a good Chablis or Sancerre.  But those would disappoint with the robust pork.  I prefer this meal with lager, and open the Brunello after dinner.

- **Comment Body:** I agree with Tom: that it has to do with the garnishes. For the savory pork itself, a robust rosé like a Tavel from France's Rhône Valley, would be perfect. But for my money, the best wines for pairing with tricky partners come from Alsace. If your accompaniments are on the spicy side, go with an Alsatian Gewurztraminer (full-bodied, and on the slightly sweet side, to balance with the spice). If your sides are more briney and acidic, like kim-chi, try a dry Alsatian Riesling or Pinot Blanc.

- **Comment Body:** I've made it twice. One 2.5lb piece of pork, the other 4lbs. Perfect, both times. It makes me feel like a matriarch feeding my brood when it's really just me and my housemate impressing ourselves in order to have leftovers for the week. If I didn't have things like this to look forward to, quarantine would have my soul.   One other thing. If you don't remove most of the cure before roasting, I'd hold on the final tbsp of kosher salt for the glaze. It can get very, very salty.

- **Comment Body:** We found pulled pork is handy in the crockpot but it releases a lot of fluid. (Still good but different, no crispy outside.)  We start it on the grill, for an hour, to crisp it up, then crock-pot it. It comes out pretty good.

- **Comment Body:** This is a fabulous easy recipe. Love the dry brine - much easier than soaking meat in a wet brine. I've made this about 5 times in the past 5 months, always a winner. Sometimes I add chinese 5 spice in the dry brine, or rub it on before roasting.  Sauces are ok but not needed!

- **Comment Body:** A huge hit. I used a 6-lb boneless shoulder for this. I did wash most of the salt (3/4 cup) off the joint before putting it in the oven and was glad I did, as I think it was salty enough in the end. I cooked it at 275 and covered it for 90 minutes, and I think the steam helped it get super tender. It was uncovered for the last 90 minutes. Took 5-1/2 hours.The rice I used wasn't sticky enough, and next time (soon) I'm going to serve it with sliced Korean rice cakes (tteok).

Cooked it for 95 mins on hi pressure then allowed natural pressure release (30 mins). I did finish it in the oven on hi broil with sugar/salt +cider vinegar. Used half the amount of salt/sugar called for in this recipe, and it was still quite salty. Although I did not rub off the brine before cooking, I discarded salt & sugar from the brining pot.Loved both the sauces.Radiccio,rice to serve.

- **Comment Body:** I believe this recipe uses Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt. Any other brand leads to extreme saltiness. I used Morton Kosher salt. I've only cooked this once but I did my research prior. Discarded all the juices and the remaining salt after brining for 36 hrs. My roast came out fine because of this step. I also covered it with foil the first hour but decided to uncover and baste because I wanted it to brown. Next time I will cook it on a higher temp for 30 min to render more fat to cook it in.

- **Comment Body:** After reading all the reviews I was terrified I'd get a salt lick because I followed the recipe using Mortons salt and dry-brined for 48 hours (whoops), but it rendered deliciousness. I dried off my meat first with a paper towel and discarded some hardened salt clumps before roasting. Taste the drippings before you baste. I added some water because it was too salty and I think that helped. And don't step away from the oven for the final caramelization step! Mine was done after 2 minutes. Yum!!

Since this recipe is such a knockout for basic pork roast, with the main seasonings coming from the excellent sauces, it makes a great base for pozole, carnitas, pulled pork sandwiches, roast pork alongside roast veggies, and anything into which you'd like some salty pork-y bits. (Korean pancakes? Scrambled eggs?) The possibilities are as amazing as the original.

I also covered the top of the pork after the third hour of cooking, and added a cup of water to a baking sheet at the bottom of the oven at hour 2 and hour 4 to get some steam going. Pork comes out moist and deeeeelicious.

The first time I didn't add 5 spice to the rub, the second time I did, and it is a great addition! As for the sauces, I'd say skip the Ssam sauce, serve with kimchi, the ginger scallion, and add pickled carrot/radish and a Korean style BBQ sauce. Perfection!

- **Comment Body:** Most of the salt-sugar mixture ended up on the bottom of the pan and eventually got tossed, but the pork was still too salty. For this reason I omitted the tablespoon of salt in the final step and went with just the brown sugar. Otherwise it was a great and easy recipe and the sauces are tasty -- I like my ginger more subtle and halved it in the ginger-scallion sauce.

- **Comment Body:** This went over well with my wife and teenage sons, but we all found the pork too salty. I used Morton Coarse Kosher Salt.    Next time, I will use about half of the salt and/or be more vigilant about scraping / washing off the salt sugar rub before putting the pork in the oven. Also, instead of cooking in the oven for 6 hours, I plan to cook in the sous vide at 165F / 74C for 18 to 24 hours before putting the pork in the oven at 500 for 10-15 minutes.

The suggestion to use apple cider vinegar with the brown sugar and salt at the end really worked (thank you). I will be making this dish again and again. PS, the ginger-scallion sauce is highly addictive.

- **Comment Body:** My family went crazy for this! Couldn’t find a shoulder with skin but it didn’t matter, the outer edges still crisped up perfectly. I did not baste as I find that opening the oven over and over causes the temperature to drop too much during cooking and then cooking time must be increased. It did not suffer from not being basted. We had leftover meat for bowls and sandwiches all week. The meat and sauces were especially good in a Bahn Mi sandwich with some quick pickled radish, cucumber, carrot.

Authentic? Perhaps not, but the sauce was the star of the show.  Had a 5lb shoulder. Roasted at 250 (per another comment suggesting that a smaller shoulder be done at a lower temp) until the meat was 200F. Took about 5hrs — DELICIOUS!!!

- **Comment Body:** Second time making this dish. Just over a 10LB roast with substantial fat cap that I scored before applying salt /sugar rub. Definitely a mistake to use Morton Kosher Salt . Way too salty even though brushed off excess before slow baking. Remembered too late that first iteration I cut back salt to half the amount and used Diamond Crystal. Baked at 275F for 8 hours - perfect and despite the salty crust the dish a winner. Do use the cider vinegar paste tip for the final sugar crust.

- **Comment Body:** Deb--You can take it out at that temp and it will be "done" (ie safe to eat and tasty), but for greater tenderness (especially the interior parts of the shoulder), I aim for 190-195. Once taken out, the temperature should continue to rise to about 200-205. The higher temp adds time to the recipe, so plan accordingly.

I used about 5.5 lbs of boneless pork butt and cooked it about 4.5 hours in a convection oven at 300 degrees. Browned it with the brown sugar rub about 8 minutes - definitely keep an eye on it to prevent burning.  The crust/bark was so good! Both sauces were a hit too.  I served it with a Thai fried rice, sesame spinach, and a Vietnamese cucumber salad.

I started it with a can of beer in the dutch oven. I didn't use any additional smoke in the form of chips or chunks. I wasn't going for a full on smoked butt. I kept the temperature down around 225-250 for most of the time (it crept up to 300 for an hour or two). It took about 11 hours for a 6.5 pounder.

I've NEVER had pork of any description that tasted irony/livery. Never.  You must have fixed a liver roast instead, or possibly a different animal all together.  What did it look like when it was alive?  Maybe it was an irony/livery.  How long did you practice gagging, anyways?

- **Comment Body:** That was my first reaction but that IS an 8-10lb roast.   Think about it per pound.  It still seems like a lot but Korean meats are so good because they are sweet and one could probably knock the salt down a notch.  I don't think I'd add salt to the sauces as the pastes in the ssam sauce are probably salty enough.    Hmmm my first reaction was NO!  Now I'm reconsidering.  :-)

As-is this is ALL ABOUT THE SAUCE.  I had homemade kimchi, ssam sauce, and the ginger scallion sauce, sweet soy with garlic chili sauce.  I'll take the suggestions found here: add 5 spice, cook less/cover partially if I can't find actual skin on(I thought the fat cap was skin) and reduce the temperature to 250 to 275. Worth trying!

- **Comment Body:** I made this during New Years week and it turned out delicious. A few notes I wanted to add based on the reviews. I made a 4.92lb bone in pork butt, it took about 6 hours to cook. I highly recommend you use a disposable roasting pan for seamless cleanup and place the meat fat cap up. The ginger scallion sauce is a do not miss addition and something we used a few days after on bo ssam tacos for leftovers. Highly recommend!

- **Comment Body:** On three separate occasions, with three separate groups of people, three people completely crushed 3.5 lb bone-in pork shoulders made per recipe (once in crock pot, until last step), served as lettuce “tacos”, sadly, no oysters. After the first delicious feast, I learned to double the ginger/scallion sauce, it is amazing. Spectacularly good, and an messy “event” to eat with friends.  Beer and g&t’s to drink, lots of sparkling water, loads of napkins, fruit for dessert. A quadruple triple.

- **Comment Body:** For the life of me I can't tell whether 'skin' refers to the physical skin on the pork butt or the crust that forms after the final broil. It's only mentioned after the latter step, and in Chang's demo with Marth Stuart there doesn't appear to be any skin on the cut of meat. Sam Sifton however in the comments seems to refer to it as being 'skin on' from the butcher. Any opinions from the crowd?

- **Comment Body:** I had a 4lb pork shoulder and was nervous about overcooking it. I cooked it at 285 for the first 4 hours and for the last 2, lowered to 265 & covered with foil. Turned out beautifully! Truly wait for that "deflated football" look. You might think it's done sooner, but it's not! I chopped the pork up carnitas style and served on a wooden board. Everyone kept picking at the caramelized bits of pork until it was gone. I supplemented the spread with grilled gojuchang shrimp in favor of the oysters.

I made the fatal mistake of thinking Diamond Crystal and Morton’s were interchangeable. Needless to say, it was inedible going down. Now I know that Diamond Crystal is the only salt to be applied. During summer if you’re feeling festive, baste it with pineapple juice, brown sugar, and gochujang. You won’t be sorry!

- **Comment Body:** Made this for dinner tonight, but since I live in a kosher home, it required some adjustment. Instead of the pork butt, I used a beef shoulder roast. To make it tender, I cooked it in the sous vide for 48 hours, and threw it on the grill for the final caramelizing of the sugar. Also used tortillas instead of the lettuce since lettuce cups get kinda messy. Huge hit. It will be on the meal plan again.

- **Comment Body:** People! Stop using table salt when a recipe calls for kosher. You’re blaming the recipe and it’s no one’s fault but your own. Just buy kosher salt for cooking and use it when the recipe calls for it. If you insist on Morton table salt when the recipe calls for kosher, you’re going to want to dial that back, sometimes by half. This is cooking 101, folks.

- **Comment Body:** For years, this has been our go-to dinner party recipe. Most everything can be prepped in advance and the only last minute detail is the caramelization before serving. There’s one serving modification we’ve made that is a game changer: Trader Joe Jicama Wraps instead of Bibb lettuce leaves. Lettuce tends to break and get messy while jicama wraps hold their shape and give an essential textural crunch to each bite. And the time saved in prep is terrific as well. We highly recommend this switch!

- **Comment Body:** I think the solution for that is to take it out and let it do the resting phase. Probably 30 minutes is best. That allows the top to cool enough to hold the brown sugar mixture when you put it back in, and time for the meat to settle (which is what the resting phase is for).

Next try: -Diamond kosher salt 1/4 cup and 1/4 cup sugar - it melted into the roast overnight -8 lb roast, 300 degrees x 10 hours, internal temp monitoring to achieve 200 degrees  -Apple cider vinegar and brown sugar for final step -The meat was amazing!! Low and slow makes it super easy. Only thing - I didn't baste or cover with foil so the fat cap/skin got inedibly hard. Will probably try foil on until last 2 hrs on next go around.

- **Comment Body:** Even a 3.5 lb roast makes an incredible amount. The slow cooker method works  in 6 - 7 hours, time so it isn't left on warm much longer. Mixed brown sugar with sherry vinegar for the crust, that worked. Made the black bean sauce without the chili paste and was delicious. Used less green onions and ginger and it worked great.

Cooked 6 hours, rested 40 minutes and then did mix a tiny bit of apple cider vinegar with the brown sugar and salt  and then 10 minutes at 500.   Do use a disposable pan. Did not smoke my kitchen.   Did not include oysters or kimchi but did serve sesame noodles and cucumber salad along side.    Super easy and delicious.

- **Comment Body:** I love this recipe, but I rarely have enough guests to justify a full batch.  So, I tried a modification.  I bought a two-pound boneless pork shoulder, and used the same recipe, with two modifications:   I sealed it in foil for the first round of cooking, to try to prevent it from drying out.  Took off the foil at 4 hours and only cooked it for a total of 5 hours, then the 15 minutes at 500.  Turned out great.  Also tried substituting white miso for the ssamjang!  Not so fine....

Halved salt in initial rub (i.e. 1/6c salt to 1/3c sugar for 3.5 pds), 12 hrs. Browned sides in a pan over medium heat, ~1-2m each side. Slow cooker on low for 7 hrs. Finished as written. Suggestion to add apple cider vinegar to brown sugar worked great. Previously, it all ran off and burned, setting off smoke alarms

- **Comment Body:** Way too salty. I had a 5.7 lbs pork shoulder, so I cut the salt/sugar to 1/2 cup each and I used Diamond brand. let it marinate overnight, rinsed off excess salt and baked it at 290F for 5+ hours. Tender but inedible by itself due to the saltines. I cut it into 8oz portions, froze it. Hate to waste all that meat so I plan to use it in street tacos, egg rolls or other inspirations to dilute the saltiness.

Take the pork out at 195 or so and let it rest and come up to temp.  It does get very smokey and scorches the roasting pan a bit but its worth it when you cook it fully to temp.

PYREX is the original, better borosilicate glass that is no longer sold in the U.S. Pyrex is the newer, cheaper soda-lime glass sold in America. PYREX should be able to withstand a few minutes under the broiler. Pyrex is best handled with great care as it has a lower thermal shock resistance.

Although you did not give it a cultural origin, most "mac & cheese" recipes begin with a roux. That would be white people's versions. Blacks don't even say "mac & cheese"; but "macaroni and cheese," perhaps because it's served formally. The current recipe is how my mother and aunts made the dish. I have since toyed with it by substituting pureed cottage cheese for milk and adding dry mustard and cayenne. Bravo!

I used the warm melted butter to temper the milk/egg mixture, and then I was able to add the warm pasta in with no problem.  Keep a very close eye on the broiler and do let it sit up for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.

Couple of things—make sure your 350 degree oven is on for at least 20 minutes before putting dish in to bake; make sure your pasta has been rinsed in cold water before adding it to cold milk/egg/cheese, salt and pepper mixture (Mixed well), and add melted butter last, mixing butter in quickly and vigorously. Make this dish! It’s five stars!

I got a late start and pulled the milk and eggs straight from the fridge - it’s been quite an ordeal to finish the recipe.  The melted butter immediately resolidified when added to the mixture (obvi, I know, unless you’re moving fast).  Then after 40 min in the oven, still watery and only now starting to get warm.  I’m sure it will still taste amazing, but just having the words “room temperature” by the milk & eggs would’ve saved me.

I needed to take the first baking to 30 minutes to get the first complement of cheese melting and the liquid simmering. I added the second helping of cheese, and then went with a 450 convection setting instead of broiling, which browned the top in a controlled way.  The recipe may be very sensitive to the pan you pick, how wet your rinsed noodles are, your oven’s temp ... use judgement.

Rinse pasta in cold water.   7. Drain pasta very well, so no water in tubes. Otherwise drippy mac/cheese

- **Comment Body:** Just made this - delicious! Just like my mom makes.  For those commenting about greasiness, it's supposed to be greasy, this is not healthy by any means. However, it absolutely does not need an entire stick of melted butter in the egg/milk mixture - I'd say half a stick at most. That definitely contributes to its outcome.  I will be making this again, thanks for sharing!

Thought I'd share the adjustments: 8 oz. macaroni, 1 C milk and 1 egg (both room-ish temp), 1/4 C unsalted butter, 8 oz. grated extra-sharp cheddar, 1 C grated Colby Jack.  Instead of rinsing the pasta I let it cool while prepping other ingredients.

I can't get colby jack where I live so I used  a melty asiago instead, and I added pinches of mustard powder, cayenne, and nutmeg to the milk mixture, and the result was great. I have tried almost all of the mac and cheeses by the NYT and I am surprised to say that this might be my new favorite.

This recipe is very similar to my own but I add a block of Velveeta in my macaroni and cheese for added creaminess.I also use sour cream and 2% milk, and I have never had a complaint. It's always the first thing to go on any occasion that I make it. But I really like the idea of having the cheese in the middle. I'm going to try it the next time I make it.

Instead of mixing the pasta, egg/milk mixture, and cheese, we layer macaroni, cheese, butter, salt, and pepper in a 1 1/2 quart buttered casserole. Two or three layers. Then pour the egg/milk mixture over. Servings come out in moist, gooey chunks. This was my favorite growing up. When I was an adult my mom would make it when I visited. Food memories. The best.

A close friend had one of the newer tempered soda-lime "Pyrex" dishes explode in the oven, with little provocation (the contents were not frozen, and he wasn't broiling). I'm told that traditional borosilicate PYREX can still be obtained from cooking supply sources in France. Meanwhile, use caution.

Wading through useless editorial comments in search of ideas from those who actually made the dish, I tried the suggestion of pureed cottage cheese instead of milk - brilliant, thank you!  Also tried the other suggestion (don´t hate!) of velveeta in place of half the milk and all the eggs - to help bind the sauce - and I hate to say it but this was also really good.  :-).

It contains an anti-closing ingredient that prevents the cheese from melting properly. Always buy a solid block of cheese and shred it by hand. I wish more recipes would clarify this for those who don’t cook often enough to know this.

Mine is very similar to this recipe except I use 1/2 stick butter and add 8 oz. sour cream. I don’t rinse my pasta unless making a salad with it. I bring the milk, egg, butter, and sour cream to almost boiling in microwave. This will make the roux your looking for without over exertion. You can heat on top of stove also but be sure to use non-stick pot and don’t over boil mixture. Perfection!

- **Comment Body:** Followed the recipe exactly.  It came out right.  It is greasy for mac and cheese, but not overwhelming.  I think key is to cook the elbow macaroni for only 4 minutes.  It needs to be undercooked and then rinsed in cold water to stop the cooking so when it is mixed and then cooked in the milk and cheese mixture it will absorb the moisture.  I prefer the roux sauce that covers macaroni more evenly, but this recipe is very good and was an excellent side to grilled halibut and a green salad.

Findings: yes, you can prep this the day before and leave in the fridge over night and bake the next day. Would recommend leaving out for one hour prior to baking. Only additional step: I mixed the pasta and cheese (already in the tray) again because the milk mixture sunk to the bottom which impacted the layer of Colby cheese in the middle. Everything else I did following the recipe and it turned out well!

- **Comment Body:** According to The Joy of Cooking, prior to the depression macaroni and cheese - often called "baked macaroni" -  was made with milk and eggs, as were many other recipes, and using a white sauce was an economical substitution. White sauces have a grainy, and when I use one, I keep adding cheese to the sauce, thinking it will become cheese-like. This recipe is a delicious custard base with a solidly "cheesy" quality because of the layered ingredients.

I let it start under medium heat, then switch to low to let the ingredients meld into a creamy dish.  My husband likes peas as a side dish

True crowd pleaser!

I looked up the difference between using the baking "dish" that the instructions say, versus metal as I now see up in the photo!  Anyway, I found a 9" x 13" Pyrex and all was well.  I'm out of my element in the kitchen so I didn't realize the box of elbow macaroni I purchased was 2 pounds instead of 1.  Luckily I figured it out before messing everything up!  It came out AWESOME. It'd be great to have good reheating instructions.

And it always seems to take forever to bring milk to a simmer for the sauce.

- **Comment Body:** Mac n Cheese is a big deal in our household.  It’s a bi-weekly treat that everyone looks forward to.  The go-to recipe for years has been a traditional roux based recipe.  Never knowing if there’s something better, I decided to try this recipe.  My 12 year old son was so disappointed he actually cried after eating half his portion (he usually has 3rds).  While no one else cried, we all agreed it was terrible.  Most wound up as leftovers which got throw out out a few days later.

Some commentary from the notes most helpful for me:   -1/2 stick of butter is plenty; a whole stick left a bit of extra grease around the edges (not that I'm complaining...)  -Forty minutes covered in my oven was perfect.  -A mix of extra sharp raw cheddar, gouda, and fresh mozz was decidedly decadent.  -Was it sacrilege to top and broil with pecorino? No, divine. -Cayenne, ground mustard!

- **Comment Body:** I‘ve been making our ‘macaroni bake’ like this for 40 years. I love that what is old is new again. A tip my great grandmother gave me was instead of rinsing the pasta, add a couple tablespoons of butter to the hot Mac to help them from sticking while they cool. I never rinse with water, because it removes all the starch that helps thicken. I, too, often add dry mustard and/or cayenne now and then, just as a variation. Along with collards, this is a meatless Monday favorite.

- **User Display Name:** Smyrna Gregg
- **Comment Body:** The intent of rinsing the cooked macaroni is to halt the cooking but it also rinses off the starches that help the sauce form and adhere (as any Italian cook knows). Instead, start the pasta a little early, remove it al dente, and after shaking and draining thoroughly in a colander, transfer the pasta to an edged baking sheet and allow to cool naturally (and continue draining). Later, temper the room-temp egg/milk mixture with warm, melted butter before adding the cooled macaroni.

I also took other's advice and waited until all ingredients were warm rather than hot or cold (such as egg, milk, and butter) before combining. By the nature of having so much cheese it is a bit greasy, but having smaller portions with another dish made for a wonderful meal.

After the first bake, I was admittedly nervous...A surprising amount of oil sat at the top of the dish. I spooned out 1/4 cup of oil, then added top layer of cheese, and proceeded to the broiler. After the dish rested for the suggested amount of time, it all seemingly came together, and was delicious! In the future I might use 3/4 stick of butter and see what happens.

Then I acquired the 2nd edition of Joy of Cooking - a magnificent family style cookbook and easily the best edition of them - and made mac & cheese with bechamel sauce.  Made correctly - which is according to the directions - it is rich and creamy with a delightful cheese flavor. I tried this one anyway and OMG it is terrible.

As for the baking I followed some of the advice given by readers and I just watched the dish as it cooked adjusting to the time for the desired result--45 mins covered and then, instead of broiling, I increased the temperature to 425 and baked it an additional 15 mins, keeping and eye on it, until the top was golden brown. The dish came out moist, cheesy and delicious

I eliminated the butter, replaced a cup of milk with cottage cheese,  combined the cheese, milk, egg mixture in the blender; added creole spice and pepper.  Increased cook time. Next time will use cold cheese since it clumped a bit (and grate by hand instead of food processor) OMG delish

- **Comment Body:** When I drained the par-cooked pasta, I shook it vigorously in the colander and then poured it back into the hot enameled cast-iron dutch oven it had cooked in, and I stirred it around for 2 minutes tops to get the pasta really dry. I also cut the butter to 5 Tblsp instead of 8. My biggest baking dish was too small for the entire pound of pasta, so I filled up an 8-inch pie pan with the leftovers, treated it the same as the big pan, and then froze it after it cooled to room temp. Great recipe!

- **Comment Body:** After sitting overnight (or even for an hour) the pasta will absorb most/all of the liquid so it won't have the creamy texture anymore and adding more milk before reheating could turn the pasta into mush. For the best creamy texture, this should be served right after the 10 min cooling period at the end.

As an adult, I make it with 4oz habanero cheddar and 8-12 oz cheddar. (You don’t need quite so much cheese and fat when you make it as an everyday dish, as I do. More cheese is better, of course, but moderation is good, too.) It’s a great vegetarian side dish, too.

Layers of dry uncooked elbow macaroni, shredded sharp cheddar and Gruyère cheeses, small cubes of butter. Then a mixture of milk, eggs, nutmeg, poured over and left in the fridge overnight. Baked for 45 minutes. It was amazingly good. I decided to make it this way because I was serving lunch for 15 people and was worried I would not have enough time in the morning.

- **Comment Body:** Lesson learned. If you’re buying pre-grated cheese there is an anticoagulant added and that might be the reason so many people described it as runny. After having my first one come out runny I grated my own cheese and it was perfect.

- **Comment Body:** Good luck with the pre-shredded cheese. It's coated with a chemical substance to prevent the pieces from sticking to each other in the package. That substance affects the cheese during cooking. Grate your own cheese for best results.

- **Comment Body:** Consider using evaporated milk in place of all or part of the milk listed. I'm from South Carolina and have been making a version of this recipe, passed down through generations, since my very first cooking days. Don't neglect this vital substitution - it's arguably the most important part. Also, this does not have to be baked; you can make it all in a dutch oven - just add the liquid and cheese carefully to the consistency you want.

- **Comment Body:** Made this tonight.  In a lesson to read ALL the instructions before charging ahead, I grated all the cheese together, so other than that little modification, and adding a bit of bacon, I tried to follow the directions.  I did not find it too salty, but it was a bit greasy (don't blame the bacon: it was crispy).  I think the half cup of melted butter was overkill, and next time will reduce that by half.  Otherwise, a hit.  I do not understand why these recipes don't just include bacon up front...

The directions are a little more complex than they look - just kind of drink less vinho verde than I do when you make this. I assume when I finally correctly follow all steps, this will be even better (if that possible), and I look forward to it.

You could use a combination of Gruyère or Emmenthal and a firm cheese such as Cantal. And I bet if you have a good local grocery store, you might even find cheddar from the UK. (Or not, because Brexit...)

- **Comment Body:** I read this recipe and also watched her cook this on YouTube to prepare to try her version soon.  One thing I will say that i will keep from my families recipe is that we cook the custard and melt some cheese in it which really makes for a good base.  Then, the dish is put in the baker in layer.  Not by randomly mixing shredded cheese every where. You also have to eye ball the cheese.  I do not think we have every used more than two 8 oz blocks of cheese.  A mix of medium and sharp cheddar.

As others have said, make sure that the pasta is cooled and a little less than al dente. Take the milk and eggs out of the fridge before you start so they can warm to room temperature.

- **Comment Body:** I made this for our Christmas day dinner and it was a big hit!! I added a couple of dashes of creole seasoning to the milk mixture before adding my pasta for some extra zing. (Many people add a bit of cayenne.) I also grated my own cheeses on the box grater instead of using pre-grated, bagged cheese. I think if you have the extra time the cheese just has a better, more full flavor. I would recommend keeping a close eye while broiling as mine did not take as long as listed.

- **Comment Body:** Excellent recipe! I echo the couple of comments below: make sure milk and eggs are at room temp before baking...after 30 minutes, it still had a ways to go.   Made it for the 2nd time and this time added drained green chilies. Yum...  Also, IMO the amount of cheese atop at the end is too much, and takes away from the simple but elegant mac n cheese underneath. Needs a cheese coating, just not that much. All that said - it's still a real winner in our book!

Sometimes add chopped spinach, onions and garlic - and the substitution of a Mexican cheese mix for Colby is definitely a winner!  Any leftovers freeze perfectly well.  Yum.

For those of us that know where there is no substitute for Velveta, we just need to come out of the closet and be heard.

However 1.5lbs of cheese need a whole lot more than just some salt and pepper. For the record, I bought the largest thing of extra extra sharp chedder.   Made it twice, first time following the recipe and second time making substitutions. Subs were: 2 egg yolks + 1 whole egg, cayenne powder, garlic powder, old bay seasoning, and a few other spices.

- **Comment Body:** Not the macaroni and cheese I am used to. I found that there was no sauce to speak of. The cheese congealed in various places and it was very buttery. It could also be that I don’t have access to Colby cheese so used a combination of cheddar and a Mexican cheese with jalapeños. Personally, I find that making a roux-based sauce makes for a creamier result.

I also found that the oven tends to overcook the eggs - by the time the whites are cooked, the yolks are solid as well. Reducing stove top heat to a simmer and putting the lid on makes it easier to keep an eye on the eggs, helps to maintain solf yolks, and also avoids the hassle of using the oven.

I tend to serve with naan or grilled flatbread and tons of cilantro and harissa.  A dollop of fatty yogurt never hurts.  Simply the best brunch food on earth.  Serve with red wine!

To set the eggs, I would cover the pan with a plate. We would also add whatever was seasonal, like peppers, or top with avocado slices when it was served. When I lived in Egypt, this was a fairly common fast-breaker or breakfast during Ramadan. Great quick dish. Never served it with cheese, but why not?

I add cooked, cubed Italian sausage while  I am reheating the sauce. I cook the eggs covered on top of the stove-- much faster than the oven. One time I had shrimp I needed to cook and I poached them in the sauce--very good. I don't always add feta. This is a very versatile recipe.

- **Comment Body:** Great recipe! Be careful, however, because it's easy to overcook the eggs. We thought it would amazing to have some runny yokes mixing with the sauce when you dip your bread in. So, the next time I try this, after the eggs go in, I plan to skip the baking and simply broil the top -- create a bubbly-crispy shell across the top, allowing the yokes to remain liquidy. Another idea: globs of goat cheese strategically placed, rather than feta sprinkled througout.

Her version was called Chakchouka, made with peppers, onions, garlic, cumin, a healthy amount of Harissa; peeled and sliced ripe plum tomatoes, were scattered round the top; covered and cooked until juicy. The eggs were dropped into indentations, covered and cooked until the whites were set. Cilantro gets sprinkled on top. Never, ever used the feta, but I guess you could. A great dinner with Pita or Naan.

- **Comment Body:** Crack the eggs into small containers (1/2 measuring cup is perfect) before lowering them - gently! - into the sauce. If sauce is too thick, add a little water to the indentations. Get the sauce simmering, then cover the pan and poach the eggs on low heat for 3-5 minutes. When whites around the yolks are somewhat set (not transparent), the dish is done.  Double spices Paprika: half sweet/smoked  Add  1 Tbl Harissa? More garlic Zatar sprinkled on top

- **Comment Body:** We used to make this in the 1950s. We never used cheese and we scrambled the eggs. It was so good that we never had any leftovers, 5 people.  We had no canned tomatoes. We grated fresh tomatoes into the pot after the peppers, onions and garlic were well cooked. Ah nostalgia.

- **Comment Body:** This was amazing. I've made it twice already. The second time was 10x. A) dice the onions and peppers, they cook more evenly and are less chunky to eat. B) You can make the spiced onion/pepper/garlic mix in advance. Don't cook it with the eggs. It tastes even better on day 2 and 3. Reheat in smaller, covered fry pan and then add the eggs as normal. Poach on the stove, covered, like other comments. C) No feta in the dish, just sprinkle on top before seating the eggs to poach. 100x better.

Rather than the eggs, I used my chicken meatballs recipe and it worked well.As with many recipes, I do modify it with twice the garlic. I also doubled the paprika and an extra half-teaspoon of cumin. I also chopped my own tomatoes since I had time and this does taste better with fresher tomatoes. Great recipe with my additions!

You can re-season this to reflect whatever cuisine you wish and it turns out well. Tonight I decided to do something a little different and substituted taco-seasoned tilapia loins for the eggs and simmered it, covered, on the stove. Served it in bowls. Yeah, I went there. It worked, too.

- **Comment Body:** I love shakshuka! I eat about 1-2x per week. Usually I opt to make everything from scratch (including this recipe), but to be honest - the best shakshuka I've had is with the Mina brand Shakshuka sauce. It's a Moroccan shakshuka  sauce that they sell in my local supermarket - reminds me of shakshukas I've had when traveling in the Middle East and Morocco. IT'S SO GOOD! I simmer, add eggs, sometimes feta, and top with cilantro. I also eat with bread to soak the sauce. Best quick breakfast ever!

- **Comment Body:** NYT recipes often run lean on spices.  Comparables recommend a tablespoon of cumin and paprika along with an entire jalapeno.  So, with that in mind, I added a tablespoon of harissa to this recipe and I used a pound bag of the small, sweet rainbow green-house peppers that used to come from Holland, but are now grown locally. I chopped them into rings.  Farm fresh eggs make a big impact in this!

The variation being the onions and tomatoes (very rip, fresh, red cherry tomatoes) sautéed with well spiced, Ethiopian red pepper powder "Awazé Berberé". Eggs are beaten with a little water for added softness and then put to the sauce, mixing lightly and cooked on lower heat then finished by adding Jalapeño like chopped green peppers. Some people add "Kibé", spiced Ethiopian butter right before turning the fire out. Yummmmm!!!

It took a surprising amount of time for the eggs to finish poaching(almost 15 mins) but it turned out perfect. I garnished with mint instead of cilantro and added chicken and portabello mushrooms. One of the easiest and best things I've cooked in awhile, I downed it with nearly two full packs of garlic naan bread.

As others have said, we've mixed it up with various veggie additions. Also, I do up the spice a bit -- and add 1/4 to 1/2 tsp turmeric. Also, suggest that you  don't do the eggs in the oven.  Stove-top with a glass lid helps to determine when the eggs are done right.     Today, I used goat cheese instead of feta. Oh my!!

Served with crusty bread, this dish was a huge hit.

- **Comment Body:** This is a fantastic one-dish breakfast or brunch meal. Like others, I'd recommend cutting back on salt by choosing no or low-salt tomatoes and watching additional salt (considering how salty feta cheese can be). I used a can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes; this added a nice depth to the sauce - it also required me to add a smudge of water to get the consistency right. I served with wheat toast, but I can see pita or corn tortillas working as well.

Crack the eggs into small containers (1/2 measuring cup is perfect) before lowering them - gently! - into the sauce. If sauce is too thick, add a little water to the indentations. Get the sauce simmering, then cover the pan and poach the eggs on low heat for 3-5 minutes. When whites around the yolks are somewhat set (not transparent), the dish is done. You want that runny yolk!

- **Comment Body:** Delicious, flavorful, and easy to make!I made this for lunch and added spinach, replaced goat cheese for the feta, and soped it up with corn tortillas. I only used four eggs as I made it for myself and like lots of sauce. I think adding sausage would be a delicious addition to this, or substituting it for the cheese. Also, potatoes would make it even heartier.

- **Comment Body:** This has become a favorite recipe for my husband and me. Sometimes I add some chopped scallions over the top along with the cilantro. I usually poach the eggs in a separate pan on top of the stove and gently submerge into the tomato sauce. Spares using the oven!

- **Comment Body:** Very flavorful. You don't really need to add anything. It tastes more 'authentic' this way -- very north African. Spinach would be a nice addition if you wanted to add a veggie that wouldn't take away from all the wonderful flavors.  I served it with roast potatoes (with some Spanish paprika sprinkled on top before baking) and a salad. Great heated up for breakfast.

- **Comment Body:** I'm not much of a cook, but this recipe was extremely easy to follow and came out tasting delicious. Followed the recipe to the letter, and then served the shakshuka heaped over toast.My only edit would be to let it simmer longer after adding the tomatoes - maybe another 5 minutes or more - in order to let it thicken up before adding the eggs. It came out a little runnier than I would have liked. Still super tasty though. Great comfort food.

- **Comment Body:** I substitute fire roasted TJ's peppers for the fresh peppers and add 1/2 way through the onion cooking, substitute 1 pkg. Trader Joe's Turkey Bolognese sauce for 1/2 the tomatoes, and beat the eggs and pour on as a top layer since I don't like poached eggs. Dorot frozen garlic is an easy substitute.  It's no longer a kosher or vegetarian dish but my guests love it.  Cook 8-11 minutes and monitor carefully.

Eggs poached quickly and perfectly-lid on.  A great recipe, seems you can use almost anything you have on hand and it will be delicious. I used a variety of red, yellow, orange peppers and red onion, along with canned tomatoes.  A substantial one dish meal.

Don't forget to spoon some of the sauce over the eggs/fish/chicken while it cooks.And - don't add the feta till the end. Sprinkle the top with zaatar spice - Sababa!!

- **Comment Body:** Ended up making a "whatever's in the fridge" version of this. Didn't have the bell peppers, feta, or cilantro, but subbed the latter two with a sprinkle of parm, and some parsley I had leftover in the fridge.   The main hurdle was my lack of actual canned tomatoes. I had cooked down some strained tomatoes I had until it started to get a thicker consistency, then followed the rest of the recipe as listed. It came out amazing and would absolutely make again (maybe after a grocery run – lol)!

- **Comment Body:** I've yet to see a mention of Labneh, the cheese that was served with this dish the several times I had it in Israel.  Labneh is basically strained, plain Greek yogurt--recipes online. But in a pinch, I've added a dollop of unstrained Greek yogurt.  I have not tried this recipe with feta, but that flavor seems like it would be a tad too salty and not tangy enough for me.  The tang of yogurt or labneh is really wonderful in this dish.

Great as written, but it benefits from a little added flavor in the form of smoked paprika or harissa or chili powder or whatever spice blend you prefer. I like to poach the eggs on the stovetop by putting a lid over the skillet, as others have suggested. Tip: Take your eggs out of the fridge early. They cook faster and more evenly when they are at room temperature.

- **Comment Body:** For a five minute breakfast, make the thick tomato base ahead. Then reheat one serving in a pan, while frying an egg or two in another pan. Break the egg yolks once the egg has set, so you can spread the yolk around the fried egg—so there is white and yolk in every bite. Plate it, and top with cilantro as usual.

- **Comment Body:** I made this for the second time and it is even better than the first... but one suggestion... My husband likes his eggs hard hard hard, and I like them a bit runnier, so I took my portion out first and his went back in the oven for another 5 minutes. BUT next time, I am going to use duck eggs (which are bigger) on one side of the pan and chicken eggs on the other. His should cook more quickly given the smaller yolks, so we can sit down to our food together.

- **Comment Body:** Smoked cheese (esp. mozzarella!) is dee-licious here, as is Armenian braided string cheese - the kind with nigella seed in it - or halloumi (if you can find it). I've also used cheddar with chipotles and even dollops of whipped cream cheese, depending on my diners' demographic - all went over big.

- **Comment Body:** I've made this fabulous recipe many times since it was first published. Everyone loves it. My adaptations: no red peppers, chickpeas instead; no cayenne, but double other spices; add thin coins of good smoked turkey sausage; no need to fuss with oven – – just cover the skillet and poach the eggs to your liking. Don't forget the flatbread. I often make this the night before (except eggs), refrigerate the whole skillet, reheat to a simmer in the morning, then simply add the eggs.

- **Comment Body:** This is my go to Shakshuka recipe base. The only thing I do to it is use less oil and add a teaspoon of hot smoked paprika along with the teaspoon of sweet paprika.If you have less than ideal tomatoes you can add some tomato paste to amp the flavor up. Additionally while baking/broiling a tomato sauce always makes it wonderful and highlights the fruit, you don't need to. Just pop a lid or cover on and let the eggs poach.

In most cases you also put yogurt on it. Having said that I tried this version with the eggs, and it turned out wonderful and so delicious. You have to put either cilantro or parsley (we didn’t have cilantro at home) because it is a great final touch. Very easy to make and I made it in iron skillet, it is even better.

I made this the same way: I skipped the feta and, when the recipe calls for the eggs, I nestled cubes of soft, silken tofu into the sauce. I cooked it a little longer in the oven to give the tofu the opportunity to soak up the flavors of the sauce. Delightful

Also, eggs didn't cooked in 7 mins and were fully cooked (not runny) in 10. Have to play around with bake time. Any suggestions would be great.

Also submerging the whites with the sauce and covering the pan. I don’t purée as I like the chopped texture, but dice rather than slice the onion and pepper. I also suggest creating a deep indentation so the egg is close to the pan’s bottom. These things have worked for me.

It was great cooked both ways, definitely a keeper. I didn't use the cilantro.

- **Comment Body:** Very good recipe. I followed it more or less by the book, and I have a couple of notes:1. You need more spice. Unless you're particularly averse to spice, in which case I'm not sure this is your dish, you should add more spice. Double the cumin, cayenne, and paprika.2. Consider fresh tomatoes, especially if in season. If you get canned tomatoes, drain the juice. If you notice the video, the chef drains her tomatoes. If not, you'll be ladling the juice out, like I did.

- **Comment Body:** I followed previous suggestions and used a less salty cheese (I used goat chevre) and after adding in the eggs, put a lid on the pan to finish it off on the stove.  Because I'm calorie-conscious I cut out 1 Tbsp of the oil and next time will probably cut out 2 Tbsp of it.  With that being said, THIS is THE comfort food dish I've been looking for my entire life.  It's amazing following the recipe as is, and as the commenter's list below, extremely versatile and forgiving.

- **Comment Body:** Lovely recipe.  For authenticity and perfect flavor, use harissa in place of spices listed above.  Roasting the bell peppers beforehand is also an excellent modification.

- **Comment Body:** I accidentally added 1 tsp of cayenne instead of 1/8 tsp, but that ended up being closer to my taste preference anyway so no harm done. It didn't taste spicy, just flavorful. I didn't have sweet paprika; smoked paprika worked fine. No need to turn on the oven just to cook the eggs--leave it on the stove and cover it with a lid. I served this with some multi-grain naan that I had in the freezer. Pita probably would have worked best, but this was good too.

- **Comment Body:** Personally, would add more eggs or reduce quantities of ingredients for red sauce next time. But enjoyed the flavors and would make again. Super easy to put together. Made sauce the night before, so could put brunch on the table w/ minimal effort in the am.

I know as a white people it’s hard for us to understand why we should have to care about oppression with our breakfast, but god Palestinians it’s every day life. I’ll glad understand this dish as Palestinian and create it in solidarity with them.

- **Comment Body:** I love this recipe. I often don't have the red pepper when I make it, but it is still good without it. I'm not very good at cooking the eggs in the sauce - they seem to spread out too much and get overcooked - so I've taken to making poached eggs in my silicone poaching cups (which I love) and then adding them to the sauce. It looks prettier and the yolks don't overcook.

- **Comment Body:** This is a wonderful recipe, with great flavor balance.  I enjoy serving it with Greek yogurt alongside, and garlicky flatbread.  This makes a lovely meal, but one can add a bit of thin-sliced sausage (e.g. chorizo) to the sauce, if you’re so inclined.  Shakshuka gives fabulous leftovers!    Also:  Careful with the hot skillet!

- **Comment Body:** I generally love MC's recipe's...But this one sounds abundantly...saucy. Without potatoes, or veggies, or something for the sauce to coat and meld with, it sounds like eggs on sauce- and I pretty much start every saute with olive oil, garlic, onions, tomato- so I have no aversion to saucy things.

- **Comment Body:** Simple and sublime!  I used peak season dry farmed early girl tomatoes, which no doubt contributed to the result.  Weighed out 28 oz then roughly chopped in food processor.  Did not bother to skin.  Note fresh tomatoes take longer to cook down.  Also added some sautéed kale and a few pinches of za'atar seasoning.  Halloumi cheese instead of feta.  Glass door oven made it easy to keep an eye on the eggs.  Removed when the whites had just set.  Served with harissa and nan to rave reviews.

I moved 1/2 the sauce to a smaller pan and added 4 eggs, but the other half in the fridge, allowing me to reheat it another night with fresh eggs.

- **Comment Body:** This is so delicious!  My best use of the recipe is to freeze the tomato mixture in single serving sizes (1/2 cup perhaps). Then when ready to eat, place one portion in a microwave-proof dish, cover, heat on high for 1 1/2 minutes. It will be very hot at this point. Then sprinkle with feta, top with a salted, quartered hard boiled egg and stir/chop into the shakshuka mixture. This will heat the egg and cool down the shakshuka mixture. Easy and delicious!
