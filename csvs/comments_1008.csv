"21371084","Mary","Being a Texan, I make guacamole frequently. The best way to prevent browning is to place saran wrap directly on the guac, allowing no air to touch it. I GUARANTEE if you follow other ""tricks"" it will still brown if you just stretch the saran wrap across the top of the serving bowl. Placing the plastic wrap directly on the guac and gently pressing it up the sides of the serving bowl will leave it just as green and pretty as when you first made it.","1508865598","294"
"100322666","Fast Marty","Guac is highly subjective.  Some people don't use cilantro; others love it.  Ditto lime juice, cumin, level of heat, chunky vs. smooth, etc.  Just tinker to get the one you like.  This is a starting place, not engraved in stone.  Have a bunch of beers or margaritas and relax.","1556975838","197"

"22746226","Beth","My Mexican grandmother was very much a purist when it came to guacamole.  Avocado, onion, tomato and salt. And nothing else. Cilantro, especially, and even peppers and lime, in my opinion, cover the mild taste of the avocado.  The avocado becomes a vehicle for the other flavors rather than the main event. The key is the salt.  Too much and it's salty.  Too little and it's flat. When you hit it exactly right, your guests will say it's the best guacamole they have ever tasted.","1506870224","142"

"100328435","Mike","I'd add a little lime juice, even if not for flavor, as the acid will help reduce (or slow down) the inevitable browning around the edges. I'd also add a little crushed garlic (crush it with course salt and add).","1557003082","13"
"18171206","JamesDJ","In my book lime juice is the third-most important ingredient after avocados and salt. I use a half lime per avocado. This recipe calls for too much cilantro and onion; while that amount makes sense for a restaurant, where they can't afford to be too picky about their avocados and therefore have to introduce bold flavors, the home cook can let the natural flavor of a good avocado shine through. Cayenne can be used instead of the chile. And use red onion and really ripe tomatoes, please.","1508873253","12"
"19984276","Tim","A more richly flavored guacamole can be had (less simply) using, in place of plain onion, thick slices of red onion marinated for an hour in a little oil, vinegar, lime juice, cumin, salt and pepper, and then grilled on a hot grill until slightly charred, then chopped.  The rest of the recipe remains about the same.  I have spent a lot of time in Mexico and never saw guacamole made without lime juice.","1508885452","11"

"21939002","SB","Many, many Mexican chefs don't use citrus because they feel it masks the flavor of the avocado. They're not wrong. You're allowed to have your preference for adding citrus, but it is by no means essential to guacamole. Mexican chefs would be very surprised to hear that their local dish should ""never"" be without something they don't even consider appropriate in it.","1506864001","9"
"23301817","Karl","Florida's so called avocados are not true avocados. In Mexico we call them pawa. It is less creamy, more watered and much less tastless. Definitively no recommended for guacamole.

"30672071","Jim","I was taught the citrus was to preserve the avocado in the guac.  Instead about 1/2 to 1 clove of finely minced garlic and a tblsp or so of diced red onion per avocado.  I always pour a bit of evo on top of garlic to keep it together while chopping. Put onion and garlic in a bowl and start with 1/2 tsp salt. let it sit while you peel and halve avocado. Needs to be soft so a fork mashes it easy. Mix well & let sit 10 min. Season to taste w/ salt & pepper. Store w/plastic wrap on top to preserve.","1550434174","4"
"100197167","Susan Marie Lucas","No need to chop the onion - use a grater's fine or medium side: it's faster and contributes to the creaminess. [And tomato in guac is heresy!]","1556296896","4"

Would have been so much easier to have the recipe.    Best to make the chips fresh by slicing and baking tortillaa on a baking sheet at about 225 degrees. I also like to serve it with side dishes of chopped onion, tomato, and sweet pepper, in case guests disagree with my taste.","1529798679","3"

I see a lot of comments about adding cumin and lime juice, which I would also typically add to guac. However, I like the simplicity of this recipe, and while I love a good hit of citrus, I am enjoying the pure avocado creaminess without it. I may try adding some toasted cumin seeds into the mortar next time to see what happens, but overall this recipe is very good as is.","1593647301","3"

(Though making it once per instructions is an okay start.) Some tomato (without the juice)? Fine, if you like it. Fresh coriander? Fine if it doesn't taste like soap to you. (It does to some.) I have occasionally added some chopped pistachios. Traditional? Nope, but let your taste buds guide you. And you can vary your recipe--it's legal.","1706894496","2"
