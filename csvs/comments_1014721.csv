"17402426","M","I ate this dish growing up in Algeria. Here are few variations my mom made: 1. Adding small meatballs for a substantial meal. 2. Grilling the peppers first, then peeling them and chopping them before adding them to the cooked tomatoes and onions. 3. using grilled eggplant instead of peppers.","1508867958","1344"
"21755813","Britta","This is a favorite and really deserves its five star rating. I like to add chickpeas or lentils to make this into a hearty eggs-for-dinner option. I also found that the oven tends to overcook the eggs - by the time the whites are cooked, the yolks are solid as well. Reducing stove top heat to a simmer and putting the lid on makes it easier to keep an eye on the eggs, helps to maintain solf yolks, and also avoids the hassle of using the oven.","1506862960","1335"
"15925113","alessandro","I am a Tuscan born and it's pretty much staple dinner food there and no need  to turn the oven on, only cover the pan and finish cooking it on the stove and serve it with plenty of Tuscan salt less bread","1509373276","883"
"17221680","Dea","This was delicious, thank you for this recipe. <br/><br/>I added 4 cups of spinach to mine and used diced tomatoes (pomi) thicker and less watery. <br/><br/>I made mine w/ 4 eggs I live alone, I had 2 for breakfast, with corn a tortilla and I will be having this plus a cup of cream of butternut squash soup. <br/><br/>Life is good when you know how to cook! :-)","1508868655","570"
"23594439","Eoghan","I hate when people say it's a great recipe and then list the dozen ingredients they added or changed. This is a great recipe as is. That said, adding a little anchovy paste doesn't change the flavor and adds a truly sublime umami. OK, that's it. Tried slipping that in without anyone noticing. But that's it. Not another thing.","1506880381","514"
"17637859","Federal Pioneer","Bomb daddy. Didn't have the peps, but went hard in the paint anyway. Hella fire. x","1508869397","492"
"17400515","Bryan","I made the mistake of stirring in the feta completely, and it dissolved entirely in the shakshuka, giving the whole dish a disappointingly musty taste. I would suggest stirring only enough to distribute the feta evenly, then not disturbing the mixture further!","1508867874","432"
"16731694","Steve","We make this in the style that we first ate it in Morocco, with the addition of ground coriander, cinnamon, turmeric, allspice and - if we have it - saffron to the spice mixture.","1509376871","381"
"16018118","Yvonne","This is a very good vegetarian recipe! I don't understand why people have the tendency to transform every vegetarian recipe by adding meat in it?<br/>Is someone dying if not ingested meat at breakfast,lunch and diner???<br/>How about just enjoy the traditional recipe without sausages,salami,bacon and shrimp?","1509374155","368"
"16659172","Jmk","This is a good basic shakshuka. To add authenticity and a deep flavor, add some harrisa (or ancho or pasilla paste) instead of cayenne and paprika, and leave out feta.<br/>Eggs stewed in tomato is found all over Middle East and North Africa, and there's an Italian and Spanish version too.","1509377492","315"
"16404513","MFK","This is a very simple, delicious Shakshuka recipe.  I cook eggs to order and serve over the sauce in a shallow bowl, to ensure they are cooked to my liking (over easy over very low heat so the whites don't overcook and the yolk is warm).  I tend to serve with naan or grilled flatbread and tons of cilantro and harissa.  A dollop of fatty yogurt never hurts.  Simply the best brunch food on earth.  Serve with red wine!","1509376026","257"

"16951668","Hillaryn","Thirty some years ago when I lived on a Kibbutz this was one of the dishes we could make in our room over a gas burner, when we didn't feel like heading to the communal dining room. To set the eggs, I would cover the pan with a plate. We would also add whatever was seasonal, like peppers, or top with avocado slices when it was served. When I lived in Egypt, this was a fairly common fast-breaker or breakfast during Ramadan. Great quick dish. Never served it with cheese, but why not?","1509378087","156"
"17152495","Carolyn Lipp","Easy and delicious, though I didn't finish it in the oven, but continued on the stovetop with a lid over the pan to poach the eggs. I also used a tablespoon of paprika rather than a teaspoon. (I like paprika!) Also used parsley (a lot of it) as I didn't have cilantro in the fridge. Turned out great. Similar to a favorite breakfast dish called Moroccan Eggs at Cafe Mogador in NYC.","1508868981","138"
"15727627","Kathy","I cook for just me so I freeze things and this recipe (the base) freezes beautifully. I dole it out in freezer bags. I add cooked, cubed Italian sausage while  I am reheating the sauce. I cook the eggs covered on top of the stove-- much faster than the oven. One time I had shrimp I needed to cook and I poached them in the sauce--very good. I don't always add feta. This is a very versatile recipe.","1509372646","95"
"16524170","Mitch Merback","Great recipe! Be careful, however, because it's easy to overcook the eggs. We thought it would amazing to have some runny yokes mixing with the sauce when you dip your bread in. So, the next time I try this, after the eggs go in, I plan to skip the baking and simply broil the top -- create a bubbly-crispy shell across the top, allowing the yokes to remain liquidy. Another idea: globs of goat cheese strategically placed, rather than feta sprinkled througout.","1509376401","94"
"17563347","Moe Rubenzahl","I love this recipe. First had it in Israel where it is so popular, some people thought it was an Israeli dish, one person said it was Hungarian. Turns out it's Tunisian!<br/><br/>I don't use the oven. I nestle the eggs in the gently simmering sauce in a covered pan and the eggs poach nicely in 3-5 minutes.","1508869413","83"
"15848059","Figaro","First made this in England in 1985. Claudia Roden appeared on BBC-TV and I bought her book. Her version was called Chakchouka, made with peppers, onions, garlic, cumin, a healthy amount of Harissa; peeled and sliced ripe plum tomatoes, were scattered round the top; covered and cooked until juicy. The eggs were dropped into indentations, covered and cooked until the whites were set. Cilantro gets sprinkled on top. Never, ever used the feta, but I guess you could. A great dinner with Pita or Naan.","1509373680","65"
"16101886","Allison","Tomatoes are fine in a cast iron skillet, just be sure the pan is seasoned with oil before hand.","1509374340","64"
"100162696","Maggie","Crack the eggs into small containers (1/2 measuring cup is perfect) before lowering them - gently! - into the sauce. If sauce is too thick, add a little water to the indentations. Get the sauce simmering, then cover the pan and poach the eggs on low heat for 3-5 minutes. When whites around the yolks are somewhat set (not transparent), the dish is done.  Double spices Paprika: half sweet/smoked  Add  1 Tbl Harissa? More garlic Zatar sprinkled on top","1556130195","62"
"16067397","Jana","Is it OK to cook a tomato sauce recipe in a cast iron skillet?","1509374563","51"
"16067226","Tami","Great suggestions from others: make the cheese chunks big, cover the pan instead of baking, sub in what makes sense or what you have on hand (for me, fresh tomatoes and basil and smoked paprika). A classic to make again and again.","1509374695","49"
"17072388","Kbncoo","Its an arabic dish( even has an arabic name)<br/>You can also try to do it with scrambled eggs and skip the oven part.","1509379173","49"
"17314759","kalpal","We used to make this in the 1950s. We never used cheese and we scrambled the eggs. It was so good that we never had any leftovers, 5 people.  We had no canned tomatoes. We grated fresh tomatoes into the pot after the peppers, onions and garlic were well cooked. Ah nostalgia.","1508867703","43"
"31531602","MrsWhatsIt","One of my all time favorite NYT recipes. I also at least double the spices. It makes a big difference if you make sure to let it cook down. Stovetop for the eggs works like a charm. This time I served it over polenta. Delicious!","1555285614","42"
"100298970","YeaYea","This was amazing. I've made it twice already. The second time was 10x. A) dice the onions and peppers, they cook more evenly and are less chunky to eat. B) You can make the spiced onion/pepper/garlic mix in advance. Don't cook it with the eggs. It tastes even better on day 2 and 3. Reheat in smaller, covered fry pan and then add the eggs as normal. Poach on the stove, covered, like other comments. C) No feta in the dish, just sprinkle on top before seating the eggs to poach. 100x better.","1556845759","42"
"18847581","Jake","I definitely agree about skipping the oven. Just pop on a lid to set up the eggs.<br/><br/>As a variation, omit the feta, and put a dollop of ricotta in the bottom of the bowl before you dish it up. Delicious.","1508877091","37"
"17318162","Scott","My wife is allergic to eggs but wanted to try this recipe. Rather than the eggs, I used my chicken meatballs recipe and it worked well.<br/><br/>As with many recipes, I do modify it with twice the garlic. I also doubled the paprika and an extra half-teaspoon of cumin. I also chopped my own tomatoes since I had time and this does taste better with fresher tomatoes. <br/><br/>Great recipe with my additions!","1508868542","34"
"16216055","Erika","Fit perfectly in a 10"" cast iron skillet. Great over basmati rice. 5 stars!","1509374035","30"
"16307650","Will K","Outstanding recipe. Found this in August and it's already a staple in our house. It's also quite flexible: you can add sausage, garbanzos, bacon (yeah, I've done it), whatever. You can re-season this to reflect whatever cuisine you wish and it turns out well. Tonight I decided to do something a little different and substituted taco-seasoned tilapia loins for the eggs and simmered it, covered, on the stove. Served it in bowls. Yeah, I went there. It worked, too.","1509375492","28"
"30721326","Karen Williams","I cooked my Shakskuka exactly per the recipe with one addition of about 2 tsp. of tomato paste to aid in thickening the sauce which was suggested by a previous reviewer.  It was absolutely delicious.  Can't wait to make again.","1550713452","26"
"16070711","cullen","Added a little saffron, sugar and a bay leaf per Ottolenghi.<br/><br/>Delicious!  Half recipe in iron skillet is perfect for two with some good bread.","1509374205","25"
"30250256","Fiona","I love shakshuka! I eat about 1-2x per week. Usually I opt to make everything from scratch (including this recipe), but to be honest - the best shakshuka I've had is with the Mina brand Shakshuka sauce. It's a Moroccan shakshuka  sauce that they sell in my local supermarket - reminds me of shakshukas I've had when traveling in the Middle East and Morocco. IT'S SO GOOD! I simmer, add eggs, sometimes feta, and top with cilantro. I also eat with bread to soak the sauce. Best quick breakfast ever! ","1547999888","22"
"15728109","Annie","If you leave off the Cuman and Cilanto, use Basil instead, you have a true Italian standby for busy days.  With a god chunk of Italian bread of course!  Agree with gabriel, lid on the skillet rather than skillet in the oven.","1509373629","21"
"27847630","Katherine","I have portions in my freezer.  That way I can defrost the night before, add an egg and make it for breakfast. Just add the feta and cilantro during cooking not before freezing.","1531600264","21"
"17316095","Erhan Kudeki","Once the feta is included, this is also Turkish menemen!","1508867556","19"
"17398698","claudiajo","I have been making this for a few years....  my secret ingredient is adding  a ""glug"" of red wine as you simmer the tomatoes. Ahh... the perfect dinner with crusty french bread. Delicious!","1508867418","19"
"31019802","CJepson","NYT recipes often run lean on spices.  Comparables recommend a tablespoon of cumin and paprika along with an entire jalapeno.  So, with that in mind, I added a tablespoon of harissa to this recipe and I used a pound bag of the small, sweet rainbow green-house peppers that used to come from Holland, but are now grown locally. I chopped them into rings.  Farm fresh eggs make a big impact in this!","1552416283","19"
"27143197","Mickey Mouth","This dish is also a breakfast staple in Ethiopia. The variation being the onions and tomatoes (very rip, fresh, red cherry tomatoes) sautéed with well spiced, Ethiopian red pepper powder ""Awazé Berberé"". Eggs are beaten with a little water for added softness and then put to the sauce, mixing lightly and cooked on lower heat then finished by adding Jalapeño like chopped green peppers. Some people add ""Kibé"", spiced Ethiopian butter right before turning the fire out. Yummmmm!!!","1526667012","18"
"30255108","Sarà t","I make this, but us Catholics call it Eggs in purgatory ","1548038497","18"
"17162390","MikeH","Taking Carolyn's advise above, I didn't put it in the oven and went for the covered pan/poaching approach. It took a surprising amount of time for the eggs to finish poaching(almost 15 mins) but it turned out perfect. I garnished with mint instead of cilantro and added chicken and portabello mushrooms. One of the easiest and best things I've cooked in awhile, I downed it with nearly two full packs of garlic naan bread.","1508867474","17"
"17243692","katy lesser","i made the tomato base the night before, making the morning happen in a flash!  this makes a seriously wonderful late weekend breakfast....an unexpected, special morning treat.  i used a few minutes of convection in the oven to speed things up.","1508868407","17"
"29768200","Beth","This has become one of our go-to Sunday brunch dishes. When it's just the two of us, we can save some of the sauce for quick meals during the week.    As others have said, we've mixed it up with various veggie additions. Also, I do up the spice a bit -- and add 1/4 to 1/2 tsp turmeric. Also, suggest that you  don't do the eggs in the oven.  Stove-top with a glass lid helps to determine when the eggs are done right.     Today, I used goat cheese instead of feta. Oh my!! ","1544977665","17"
"30224520","Gwen","I make this with Marcella Hazan's tomato sauce.  I cut the onion into 8ths and save it.  I roast the red peppers and put it all on a pile of greens that I've wilted.  Add the eggs and finish covered on the top of the stove.  Sometimes I have roasted butternut squash and throw some of that in there also.  Travels to work with no problem!   ","1547836588","17"
"31250609","Bruce","A few thoughts:  (1) make divots for the eggs so they will cook faster; (2) use fire-roasted tomatoes; (3) consider finished the eggs under a broiler for a few seconds; (4) two eggs per person on a hungry night (5) as others have said, doubling the spices, and using half smoked paprika and half regular paprika, worked well.  Served with crusty bread, this dish was a huge hit.","1553642640","17"
"16956243","UncleNat","Harissa - a North African paste of hot red peppers and garlic - would be best. Louisiana hot sauces like Frank's are probably too vinegary for this. I'd go with something thicker - if you can't get harissa (in Middle Eastern groceries) maybe at least a Mexican hot sauce?","1509379206","16"
"17252770","Gladys","This is a fantastic one-dish breakfast or brunch meal. Like others, I'd recommend cutting back on salt by choosing no or low-salt tomatoes and watching additional salt (considering how salty feta cheese can be). I used a can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes; this added a nice depth to the sauce - it also required me to add a smudge of water to get the consistency right. I served with wheat toast, but I can see pita or corn tortillas working as well.","1508868096","16"
"25621827","Lauren","Living in Santa Fe, New Mexico, we, of course, had to add some green chile and Mexican queso, so we now have Shakshuka Norteno!","1516376042","16"

"29686430","Beverley","My Dad, who would be 100, was stationed in Turkey w/NATO after WWII. When I grew up, for Sunday night suppers, the only time he cooked, he would make this dish, but his name for it was Min a Min. No cheese, and the eggs were cooked stovetop. He was there in the late '40's and no doubt the recipe precedes by decades or even centuries! Enjoy!","1544408544","14"
"16067609","linda","This is a simple and delicious dish. Let's not squabble over provenance. If I don't have feta I'll add goat cheese or Parmesan or Asiago. You can turn up how hot it is or tone it down. I'm not a purist, I've added cooked potatoes, green beans...whatever I think would work. This is a lovely meal for any time of the day with good bread.","1509374484","12"
"16142186","mimi","it's easy to make, delicious, and satisfying with no meat!  i learned from the first minor mistake that you have to leave the tomato juice in the can out of the recipe (other than the juice inside the tomatoes themselves).  otherwise it will get too soggy.","1509374716","12"
"17054658","Basil","I'm used to the sauce being matbucha, which is a North African cooked salad - instead of frying the peppers, you chargrill them in an oven, cool in a plastic bag and then slice. If you make a double portion, half can be used to make the shakshuka and half as a salad / dip (served cold) with pita or challah and humus","1509378281","12"
"23105396","George","I've been reading the comments that Shakshuska isn't from Israel, it's not, it's not Palestinian either.  The dish originates in Tunisia.   And if read carefully, add some chilies,swap the pita for a tortilla and its huevos rancheros ( the argument there is Mexico V NewMexico) add some basil and you've  got poached eggs in tomato sauce popular long before Modern Israel....in New Orleans!   Make this, call it what ever you like, but breakfast lunch or dinner, this  is a w","1506874471","12"
"29101757","Jed","To make this a heartier meal I browned 16oz mild Italian sausage first, removed the meat, and then cooked the pepper and onion in the fat. Just before stirring in the feta I stirred in the sausage, as well as a couple cups of al dente steamed broccoli. I also added 2 more eggs so that the 4 of us each got 2. Results were spectacular overall. Melissa Clark does it again!","1540169320","12"
"30157432","Lauren","This was lovely. I did cook 1 lb. lamb merguez bulk sausage as my first step, then removed it from the pan and sauteed the vegetables in the drippings, adding extra garlic. I added the sausage back in with the feta. The eggs took a couple min of extra broiling at the end. It was delicious!","1547520091","11"
"29972787","Zach","The dish you are thinking of is similar to Shakshuka, it is indeed called menemen. Very popular breakfast dish in Turkey. That method scrambles the eggs and uses a chopped tomato and finger pepper mixture. Enjoy!","1546474064","10"
"31094090","Phil","As others have said the spices run lean. I usually triple them and add an entire container of Feta. I also cook the eggs by covering and simmering on the stovetop instead of baking. I've had much better luck with them that way.   I also add crimini mushrooms and fresh spinach on occasion. So good.","1552789550","10"
"31530766","Priscilla Davis","I agree with other commenters, add more of the spices, and I used half smoked paprika, half regular (sweet).  I also took suggestion of cooking eggs mostly on top of stove and putting under broiler for about 1 1/2 mins at the end to finish cooking.  Excellent Sunday morning dish.","1555273798","10"
"15087746","judith s schachter","this is an excellent adaptable recipe. The tomato base can be made with fresh plum tomatoes, with added moroccan spices and alternately, according to a Polish friend with some kielbasa thrown in. She covers the pan to finish the eggs, I doubled for 5 people and used a dozen eggs, a large baking dish in the oven to finish but it took longer than 10 minutes to set the eggs, nothing was left at the end so this is a 5 star recipe for me.","1509369180","9"
"16853711","Linda H","I served this the morning after Thanksgiving for 20 house guests. The sauce was made a few days ahead.  Rave reviews. This is one of my favorite comfort foods, first eaten at an Israeli restaurant in Brooklyn many years ago.  This is a superb version.","1509379044","9"
"17259429","CG","Delicious! I overcooked my eggs because I opted to cover them instead of bake and I covered them for too long. I also think I may have put a tad bit too much feta in it (is that possible?!) I accompanied it with garlic naan for dipping. Super tasty and plenty left over to use for breakfast for the next few days. A winner of a recipe!","1508867399","9"

"100147208","Charles Michener","Key point about the eggs: they should be poached, not baked. Which means do it all on the stovetop. Crack the eggs into small containers (1/2 measuring cup is perfect) before lowering them - gently! - into the sauce. If sauce is too thick, add a little water to the indentations. Get the sauce simmering, then cover the pan and poach the eggs on low heat for 3-5 minutes. When whites around the yolks are somewhat set (not transparent), the dish is done. You want that runny yolk!","1556053527","9"

"21055868","Paul Z","I've made this a bunch of times.  Doubled the garlic, of course, and added more onion.  Also used less feta - about 3/4 cup - as the stated amount makes the dish too salty for me.  Tonight, making it with eggs my chickens laid, onions & garlic we grew, and no-knead bread I made this morning.","1508857667","8"
"21847647","Mara","The diversity of origin of this recipe just tells us that we should all sit at the same table and share a meal; my idea of the beginnings of world peace through food.  BTW, this is a real great  pantry recipe, modifiable according to what you have at home for breakfast, lunch or dinner.","1506863416","8"
"23818122","Zahara W.","This is definitely a MOROCCAN recipe.  In it's called charmoula or charmila with eggs The really best way to make it is with kefta and eggs.<br/>Kefta is Moroccan meat balls with finely minced onions, cumin, paprika, coriander, salt, pepper and a little cayenne if you want. Cook the sauce, then add the kefta, rolled into tiny meatballs.<br/>Cook the kefta and then break the eggs into the sauce and cook until the white is not runny.  Fantastic!","1506884252","8"

"17316781","Deb","Or just add his eggs first, and after a while, add yours to the pan, so they're done simultaneously! Although I do like the duck egg idea—if only I could buy them here!","1508867992","7"
"17325245","Kara","Delicious, flavorful, and easy to make!<br/><br/>I made this for lunch and added spinach, replaced goat cheese for the feta, and soped it up with corn tortillas. I only used four eggs as I made it for myself and like lots of sauce. <br/><br/>I think adding sausage would be a delicious addition to this, or substituting it for the cheese. Also, potatoes would make it even heartier.","1508868526","7"
"19283465","Mavenjoy","Love, love, love this dish! We sub in roasted red peppers for the tomatoes which kicks it up all the more and adds even more depth to its rich flavors.

"30253919","KP","This has become a favorite recipe for my husband and me. Sometimes I add some chopped scallions over the top along with the cilantro. I usually poach the eggs in a separate pan on top of the stove and gently submerge into the tomato sauce. Spares using the oven!","1548021702","7"
"16071503","camilia","Very flavorful. You don't really need to add anything. It tastes more 'authentic' this way -- very north African. Spinach would be a nice addition if you wanted to add a veggie that wouldn't take away from all the wonderful flavors.  I served it with roast potatoes (with some Spanish paprika sprinkled on top before baking) and a salad. Great heated up for breakfast.","1509374349","6"
"16076555","Dana","Defreakinglicious! Made the tomato part last night, put a portion into a bowl with an egg and cooked it in my toaster oven this morning. Lightly toasted country bread is a perfect crunchy complement to the texture of the shokshuksa. I'll  use this recipe again and again.","1509374939","6"
"17163367","Candice","I'm not much of a cook, but this recipe was extremely easy to follow and came out tasting delicious. Followed the recipe to the letter, and then served the shakshuka heaped over toast.<br/>My only edit would be to let it simmer longer after adding the tomatoes - maybe another 5 minutes or more - in order to let it thicken up before adding the eggs. It came out a little runnier than I would have liked. Still super tasty though. Great comfort food.","1508867969","6"

"17767445","Bryan Louiselle","This is a wonderful and easy recipe. I'm on board with the person who suggested more spice: coriander, turmeric, cinnamon, etc. Also, chickpeas. Serve over a bed of raw spinach - it'll wilt under the heat. Add a basket of warm, fresh, pita bread to the mix. So delicious.","1508871745","6"
"22317078","Mike","Excellent recipe...the key is be patient and let the moisture cook off of the tomatoes...let it thicken before you stir in the feta and bake.<br/>I've made this several times and now I jones for it!!!<br/><br/>Make it...end of discussion.","1506866554","6"
"28457294","Alan","To add some texture, I added pan fried sliced red potatoes when plated.     I also substituted a jalapeño for the cayenne.  Yum-a-lum-a","1535764721","6"
"29975230","Lisa V","I made this with a half and half mixture of Pimentón Dulce and Pimentón Picante   cumin. I did not use Cayenne. I baked it at 375 for about 5 minutes then switched to broil for another 4 minutes. it came out perfectly. We ate it with farro and pita. Delicious.","1546491545","6"
"30151825","e","try with crushed tomatoes not whole plum. try skipping feta. and wish harissa. The version with feta is not spicy enough.","1547498276","6"
"30249974","SM","So perfect- I kept it all in a pan on the stove top and put a lid on it once the eggs were in on low medium heat until the looked poached also added Za’atar into the sauce and lots more Cumin.  So perfect! ","1547998767","6"
"31500555","David","I substitute fire roasted TJ's peppers for the fresh peppers and add 1/2 way through the onion cooking, substitute 1 pkg. Trader Joe's Turkey Bolognese sauce for 1/2 the tomatoes, and beat the eggs and pour on as a top layer since I don't like poached eggs. Dorot frozen garlic is an easy substitute.  It's no longer a kosher or vegetarian dish but my guests love it.  Cook 8-11 minutes and monitor carefully.","1555023862","6"
"100028766","Jeff","I liked this.  I doubled cumin & paprika and added a little more feta.  Served w/ a baguette.  Delicious.  My eggs went a little past runny.","1555413354","6"
"15727781","Joyce Field","Would like to be able to print the Introduction to the recipes with the recipe itself. Could be optional.<br/>This dish could be completed on the top of the stove with a cover over the skillet, I think.","1509373656","5"
"15735154","Irene","Had a lot of fresh basil, so used that, garlic and paprika as the only seasoning.  Cooked everything in a cast iron skillet on the stove.  Eggs poached quickly and perfectly-lid on.  A great recipe, seems you can use almost anything you have on hand and it will be delicious. I used a variety of red, yellow, orange peppers and red onion, along with canned tomatoes.  A substantial one dish meal.","1509373381","5"
"16139388","Kathy","I doubled the cumin and paprika and added Berbere in addition to the cayenne. That upped the heat a bit.  Also added lamb sausage.  Will just fry eggs to put on top when I make it for more than two. Not sure this recipe is enough for 6. Maybe 4 at the most.  Or did we just eat way more than normal people? Sooo good!","1509374744","5"
"16302309","Fred","Very simple and delicious. The eggs took a bit longer to set than the 7-10 minutes indicated. I made this in a 12"" non-stick pan as I was concerned about the tomatoes in a cast iron pan like the picture shows.","1509376308","5"
"16319750","Maggie","I worked off this recipe with a few adjustments--I'm allergic to onions so I left those out, and I added ground lamb. Amazing! One of the best dishes I've ever made. It is incredibly easy and quick and was a huge hit. My partner was especially pleased that it is not messy at all so he finished the dishes in record time!","1509375425","5"
"16600257","dave","Delicious! But every time I make it, the eggs take ~15 minutes to set.","1509376856","5"
"17101440","EvelynU","Holy cow, this is delicious! Only thing I did different was to use smoked paprika, which goes well too. Use the best feta you know. Yum!","1508868992","5"
"17337703","Diane Miller","Fresh local eggs were delivered today, and went right into this. So good. Rather salty with the feta, so I would reduce the added salt.","1508867567","5"
"17395909","J López","Thanks for all the notes. We didn't miss the salt at all and finished the eggs on the stove top.  My wife is allergic to bell peppers so I used a habanero pepper instead.<br/>Gave it an extra kick so there was no need for hot sauce for serving. It was delicious.","1508868529","5"
"17402572","Walker in Raleigh","I had this last night at Nightbell, a restaurant in Asheville, NC.  No cheese added, but they DID add stone ground grits and mushrooms.  Egg barely cooked.  Delicious!","1508867524","5"
"17688352","G","This recipe was excellent. I didn't have any red peppers, but I made the recipe anyway. It was fantastic.","1508869594","5"
"19893188","Srulik","Variations:<br/>Sauce - add 3/4 cooked cauliflower, broccoli, spinach, mushrooms.<br/>For the ""protein"" - we have made it with fish fillets poached on top (salmon, halibut, flounder, tilapia) and even chicken breast.<br/>Also - don't use the oven - poach by keeping a tight lid on once the protein is added. Don't forget to spoon some of the sauce over the eggs/fish/chicken while it cooks.<br/>And - don't add the feta till the end. Sprinkle the top with zaatar spice - Sababa!!","1508883896","5"

"29767264","Debbie ","I add a few tablespoons of tomato paste as I am sauteeing the vegetables.   Adds a nice bit of sweetness.   I got addicted to shakshuka when we spent a few weeks in Israel.   ","1544971300","5"
"29862366","Harold","Very tasty - especially when duck eggs are subsitiuted 1 for 1 for the regular eggs!  Their creamy yolks really heighten this dish.  I also doubled the cayenne pepper to 1/4 tsp.","1545529479","5"
"30250565","Wendy","Delicious - cooked as per the recipe with one important exception. As others have noted, it would have been far too salty with 3/4 teaspoon salt if cooked with feta.  I used 1/4 tsp salt - which was more than enough. ","1548000958","5"
"30456554","Doren","I know this may be heretical, but I've often made the sauce, with aleppo pepper and less salt,  and just poured it on quartered hard boiled eggs, because I always have them around and it's easy (plus I like them hard).  But the sauce is divine, with or without feta cheese.","1549226471","5"
"30833566","Andrea Jean","Ended up making a ""whatever's in the fridge"" version of this. Didn't have the bell peppers, feta, or cilantro, but subbed the latter two with a sprinkle of parm, and some parsley I had leftover in the fridge.   The main hurdle was my lack of actual canned tomatoes. I had cooked down some strained tomatoes I had until it started to get a thicker consistency, then followed the rest of the recipe as listed. It came out amazing and would absolutely make again (maybe after a grocery run – lol)!","1551373316","5"
"30996873","Leslie","I've made this many times, usually as written, but I use a little more heat (cayenne), smoked paprika on occasion, and LOTS more feta - some stirred in, some on top - just because we love feta.","1552318238","5"
"100116977","Fxfxrorthogal","So good! I added a tablespoon of all the spices in the recipe plus a tablespoon of Harissa. Used extra garlic and feta. Added the eggs, covered the skillet and cooked on the stove. Served for Easter brunch over hash browns. A big hit with everyone!","1555873690","5"

Labneh is basically strained, plain Greek yogurt--recipes online. But in a pinch, I've added a dollop of unstrained Greek yogurt.  I have not tried this recipe with feta, but that flavor seems like it would be a tad too salty and not tangy enough for me.  The tang of yogurt or labneh is really wonderful in this dish.","1513022685","4"

"31205817","Deborah Buckley","I also increased the spices.  I found that 10 minutes in the oven resulted in an almost hard cooked egg texture.  I'd keep it to the 7 minutes if you prefer a runnier yolk.","1553433371","4"

"100233348","Nick","Doubling spices so it had some flavor (too often at restaurants this dish looks and sounds amazing but tastes bland) and doing it all on the stovetop (with lid) so eggs were poached worked perfectly. I didn’t have any feta handy so did without and it was still great.","1556552455","4"

"100356764","SH in SC","This was great! I read the comments & added extra spices like turmeric, cinnamon, allspice & coriander plus I added a pinch of Garam Masala & nutmeg. Ate with some naan. Broiled the eggs a little too long, so they weren’t runny; will need to practice more. My boyfriend said it tasted like huevos rancheros.","1557186548","4"
"117288093","Mel B","Super easy recipe and very forgiving. Great as written, but it benefits from a little added flavor in the form of smoked paprika or harissa or chili powder or whatever spice blend you prefer. I like to poach the eggs on the stovetop by putting a lid over the skillet, as others have suggested. Tip: Take your eggs out of the fridge early. They cook faster and more evenly when they are at room temperature.","1646818599","4"
"14800562","RLB","This was delicious and couldn't have been easier to make. I had to bake it about 20 minutes longer than the recipe called for to get the eggs to set up, but I'm in Denver, so that's probably altitude related. I would definitely make this again. Thanks!","1509368545","3"
"15740091","JD","Incredibly simple and delicious. I just used what I had on hand for a late morning Sunday brunch. Therefore no onion or peppers. The cumin and paprika and cayenne gave this all the flavor it needs. Added Bulgarian feta, and, like others, I poached the egg stove-top with the lid on. Fantastic.","1509372769","3"
"16020041","Annie","I added a half container of Cremini mushrooms chopped to the onions and peppers, then fresh spinach when the tomatos went in- Just to increase veggie content. I put 8 eggs in and covered it to cook them on the stovetop, as others have done. I can't wait to make this again! My new go-to breakfast for a few people.

"16422472","Jim","For a five minute breakfast, make the thick tomato base ahead. Then reheat one serving in a pan, while frying an egg or two in another pan. Break the egg yolks once the egg has set, so you can spread the yolk around the fried egg—so there is white and yolk in every bite. Plate it, and top with cilantro as usual.","1509375417","3"
"17245312","NJR","I made this for the second time and it is even better than the first... but one suggestion... My husband likes his eggs hard hard hard, and I like them a bit runnier, so I took my portion out first and his went back in the oven for another 5 minutes. BUT next time, I am going to use duck eggs (which are bigger) on one side of the pan and chicken eggs on the other. His should cook more quickly given the smaller yolks, so we can sit down to our food together.","1508868250","3"

My adaptations: no red peppers, chickpeas instead; no cayenne, but double other spices; add thin coins of good smoked turkey sausage; no need to fuss with oven – – just cover the skillet and poach the eggs to your liking. Don't forget the flatbread. <br/><br/>I often make this the night before (except eggs), refrigerate the whole skillet, reheat to a simmer in the morning, then simply add the eggs.","1508869323","3"
"17747671","Tess","Didn't have sweet paprika but did have Spanish pimenton. It was delicious! Made a big batch (without the cheese or egg) and kept in the fridge for a quick reheatable dinner one night. Added the cheese, heated it up, then cracked the eggs and baked. Perfect!","1508871159","3"

"21033143","MHO","I've been cooking different variations on shakshuka for years. The ingredient that makes the most difference comes from the recipe by the Ottolenghi guys in the Plenty cookbook- add 4 teaspoons  of muscovado sugar. I know, I know, sugar is poison, but honestly- a game-changer.","1508858295","3"

The only thing I do to it is use less oil and add a teaspoon of hot smoked paprika along with the teaspoon of sweet paprika.<br/><br/>If you have less than ideal tomatoes you can add some tomato paste to amp the flavor up. <br/><br/>Additionally while baking/broiling a tomato sauce always makes it wonderful and highlights the fruit, you don't need to. Just pop a lid or cover on and let the eggs poach. ","1508764025","3"

In most cases you also put yogurt on it. Having said that I tried this version with the eggs, and it turned out wonderful and so delicious. You have to put either cilantro or parsley (we didn’t have cilantro at home) because it is a great final touch. Very easy to make and I made it in iron skillet, it is even better. ","1547867953","3"

I cooked it a little longer in the oven to give the tofu the opportunity to soak up the flavors of the sauce. Delightful ","1549928897","3"

"118080735","Tani","Christine, I have also had this issue. Cook’s Illustrated suggested puréing the sauce as the more solid sauce doesn’t transmit heat evenly.

I also suggest creating a deep indentation so the egg is close to the pan’s bottom. These things have worked for me.","1651251628","3"

"17435981","bestbets","Really delicious. I added a bunch of spinach right before stirring in the feta. Served with naan, which made everyone happy. They thought it was the perfect pairing.","1508870373","2"
"17436553","Jordan","Very good recipe. I followed it more or less by the book, and I have a couple of notes:<br/>1. You need more spice. Unless you're particularly averse to spice, in which case I'm not sure this is your dish, you should add more spice. Double the cumin, cayenne, and paprika.<br/><br/>2. Consider fresh tomatoes, especially if in season. If you get canned tomatoes, drain the juice. If you notice the video, the chef drains her tomatoes. If not, you'll be ladling the juice out, like I did.","1508870401","2"
"17530750","Cindy","Pretty good but I think the recipe calls for more salt than needed. I added 3/4 tsp to the tomatoes and didn't sprinkle more on the eggs, and it was too much.","1508870500","2"
"17563216","bluetomatoes","our experience:<br/>1. Longer to get eggs set -- 15 minutes. Maybe our oven<br/>2. Reduced juices - thicker, less running obviously. Be picky about your tomatoes - balanced between sugars and acid<br/>3. 2x spices except cayenne<br/>4. Used eggs from our chickens (yum!)<br/>5. Caramelized onions and roasted pepper -- improved but more work. Consider increasing red pepper if you like pepper<br/>6. Agreed on salt.<br/>7. Had bacon on the side and a citrus salad. Nice compliments.","1508870164","2"
"17563364","Moe Rubenzahl","I think you're probably right. I use about 3/4 tsp of kosher salt (which is about 1/2 tsp of table salt). I use some with the onions (since onions soften much better when lightly salted and salt the eggs. Taste the tomatoes -- some canned products are salted more than others.","1508869639","2"
"18388847","Vanessa M.","I followed previous suggestions and used a less salty cheese (I used goat chevre) and after adding in the eggs, put a lid on the pan to finish it off on the stove.  Because I'm calorie-conscious I cut out 1 Tbsp of the oil and next time will probably cut out 2 Tbsp of it.  With that being said, THIS is THE comfort food dish I've been looking for my entire life.  It's amazing following the recipe as is, and as the commenter's list below, extremely versatile and forgiving.","1508875250","2"
"21071894","Ann","I added a can of black beans and put a lid over the skillet to cook the eggs. It's a delicious meal that comes together quickly. This will definitely be added to my rotation.","1508858869","2"
"22329940","VCaitlan","Lovely recipe.  For authenticity and perfect flavor, use harissa in place of spices listed above.  Roasting the bell peppers beforehand is also an excellent modification.","1506867281","2"
"22377443","Alison","I accidentally added 1 tsp of cayenne instead of 1/8 tsp, but that ended up being closer to my taste preference anyway so no harm done. It didn't taste spicy, just flavorful. I didn't have sweet paprika; smoked paprika worked fine. No need to turn on the oven just to cook the eggs--leave it on the stove and cover it with a lid. I served this with some multi-grain naan that I had in the freezer. Pita probably would have worked best, but this was good too.","1506866813","2"
"22988838","cookingforfun","Personally, would add more eggs or reduce quantities of ingredients for red sauce next time. But enjoyed the flavors and would make again. Super easy to put together. Made sauce the night before, so could put brunch on the table w/ minimal effort in the am. ","1506873856","2"
"24638405","Steve","Actually, maybe it's not Israeli or Palestinian. This dish was a frequent dinner in my Italian household dating back 5 decades and more. Who's stealing what from whom?","1509341506","2"
"25172831","Stacey","Rather insensitive of you, concerning there IS a war between Israelis and Palestinians, and we should never contribute toward the erasure if Palestinian culture. I know as a white people it’s hard for us to understand why we should have to care about oppression with our breakfast, but god Palestinians it’s every day life. I’ll glad understand this dish as Palestinian and create it in solidarity with them.","1512913746","2"
"25172858","Stacey","It matters that it’s palestinian. I know as white people we don’t think we should have to hear about oppression with our breakfast, but for them it’s every day. There already is a war. Such a privileged, misled statement you made.","1512913844","2"

"26981249","Nancy","I love this recipe. I often don't have the red pepper when I make it, but it is still good without it. I'm not very good at cooking the eggs in the sauce - they seem to spread out too much and get overcooked - so I've taken to making poached eggs in my silicone poaching cups (which I love) and then adding them to the sauce. It looks prettier and the yolks don't overcook.","1525481310","2"
"27008125","Easy and delicious","Except for the feta, it’s likely you have everything for this dish in your kitchen. It goes really nicely on top slabs of roasted cauliflower, for which there is also a nytimes recipe. ","1525744094","2"
"27078523","Kathy","Made this dish for Mother's Day. It was fabulous ""as is."" Did not even need the hot sauce recommended for serving. Would definitely make it again.","1526239466","2"

"27377019","Emily S.","This is a wonderful recipe, with great flavor balance.  I enjoy serving it with Greek yogurt alongside, and garlicky flatbread.  This makes a lovely meal, but one can add a bit of thin-sliced sausage (e.g. chorizo) to the sauce, if you’re so inclined.  Shakshuka gives fabulous leftovers!    Also:  Careful with the hot skillet!","1528411464","2"
"27400697","Kay","Thanks for this comment! I was just making shakshuka and wondering about how great it would taste with berbere seasoning added. I'm going to try it.","1528591716","2"

"28557407","scratchy","I generally love MC's recipe's...But this one sounds abundantly...saucy. Without potatoes, or veggies, or something for the sauce to coat and meld with, it sounds like eggs on sauce- and I pretty much start every saute with olive oil, garlic, onions, tomato- so I have no aversion to saucy things.","1536601357","2"
"28558310","Lily in CT","I prefer to lightly poach the eggs and then place them on the sauce. Then I crumble the feta over and broil it in the toaster oven for a few minutes. I find that baking the eggs in the sauce results in overcooked eggs.","1536605306","2"
"28868764","Laurel W","Simple and sublime!  I used peak season dry farmed early girl tomatoes, which no doubt contributed to the result.  Weighed out 28 oz then roughly chopped in food processor.  Did not bother to skin.  Note fresh tomatoes take longer to cook down.  Also added some sautéed kale and a few pinches of za'atar seasoning.  Halloumi cheese instead of feta.  Glass door oven made it easy to keep an eye on the eggs.  Removed when the whites had just set.  Served with harissa and nan to rave reviews.","1538583483","2"

"102505071","Jane Speyer","This was a delicious recipe.  I used smoked paprika and added a jalapeno because I wanted it to be a little spicy. I also divided the sauce before adding the eggs.  I moved 1/2 the sauce to a smaller pan and added 4 eggs, but the other half in the fridge, allowing me to reheat it another night with fresh eggs.","1568428619","2"

"105613771","Penni Gladstone","Outstanding It should also be used as a pasta sauce. Others said and I did: add one small eggplant which made it more substantial. Threw in a handful of spinach.  The eggs were a surprise to my family and everyone love it.","1583369093","2"

"106828785","RDJohn","This is so delicious!  My best use of the recipe is to freeze the tomato mixture in single serving sizes (1/2 cup perhaps). Then when ready to eat, place one portion in a microwave-proof dish, cover, heat on high for 1 1/2 minutes. It will be very hot at this point. Then sprinkle with feta, top with a salted, quartered hard boiled egg and stir/chop into the shakshuka mixture. This will heat the egg and cool down the shakshuka mixture. Easy and delicious!","1588435738","2"

"111958099","SUZANNE","TIP:  No need to bake in the the oven, just cover the pan and finish cooking until eggs whites have formed but yolk is not yet hardened.  Possible variations: Consider adding in: - small meatballs - grilled eggplant instead of peppers - 4 cups of spinach  - diced tomatoes (Pomi) - thicker  - Moroccan style: ground coriander, cinnamon, turmeric, allspice, saffron  Serve with: - diced Avocados - Labneh or Greek yogurt - Crusty bread or Corn tortillas - more feta or goat cheese","1615423499","2"
