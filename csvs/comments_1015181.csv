"26714463","Kim","I cannot comment of the taste of the sauce. It was cooling and I ran a short errand. In the meantime, my 8 year old Labrador Retriever, Jake, (who had never, ever bothered anything in the kitchen) somehow got the pot off of the cooktop and ate all of the sauce. The worst part was that I had tripled the recipe, so Jake ate 3 pounds of Bolognese sauce! I am certain he would rate the sauce a 5. We had to go out for dinner, but I will make the recipe again and post relevant feedback!PS Jake is fine.","1523578844","5826"

"16585135","Andrew from New York","This was a great and helpful guide. Added a few bits more here, reduced a few things there and ended up with a great bolognese. <br/><br/>I have to laugh at the people who are complaining about it not being good. You're saying that you had something on your stove top for 3 hours and not once did you taste it? This is cooking not baking. You taste everything at every step along the way and make adjustments. It is the lazy cook that blames the recipe","1509377171","1999"
"16117338","Mark","I've been making this sauce for 25 years.    It comes out great every time.   I can say that it works with ground beef or a mixture of beef, pork and/or veal.    I can also say that this sauce is 97.32% as good after 1 hour as it is after 3 hours, so if you're impatient.    Noting that it takes about 1 hour to get to step 4, so if you started cooking a bit late, when you get to step 4, you can eat it with minimal reduction in quality after one hour of cooking.","1509374469","1493"
"16118044","Maria","I have the 1979 version of the book. The proportions of ingredients in my cookbook are very different.<br/><br/>For 3/4 lb of beef, go with:<br/>3 tbs each - olive oil and butter<br/>2 tbs each chopped onion, celery and carrot<br/>1/2 c milk<br/>2 c canned Italian tomatoes, roughly chopped.<br/><br/>My recipe calls for adding the wine and cooking off, before adding the milk.<br/><br/>I always make a triple or quadruple recipe.  I cut down on the amount of butter/oil I use - never more than 4-6 tbs of each.  It freezes well.","1509374586","1286"
"31044909","Creggio","Marcella has never never let me down. No exception here. If you have had less than a satisfactory result, less thaN a religious experience, try this: 1.	Do what she says—EXACTLY. 2.	Tell Alexa to play Puccini or Verdi 3.	Use the heavy bottom pot. 4.	Do NOTHING to make any step happen more quickly. 7.	Don’t deviate from her instructions. You will have a different result. Tanti saluti.","1552506640","1059"
"23805063","Brian T Hunt","Authentic. Using a broad, flat noodle such as parpadelle is essential. Chop the vegetables pretty fine- they seem to disappear, but are actually part of the chunks in the ragu. The tip about using a little butter and a little starchy pasta water to toss the sauce with the pasta is also important. And spring for the real Parmesan-Reggiano- desecrating a five-hour ragu with stuff from the green can would not only be disastrously counter-productive and sad, but borderline immoral. :)","1506884418","913"
"17391205","Linda","This the the best Bolognese recipe there is in my opinion. Btw... Ground chuck is 80/20 ground beef. That is also known as 80%. Any leaner beef and the sauce would not be correct. We do not find it too fatty in the least. You need the butter and whole milk for this sauce to be the way it is supposed to be. Using turkey and skim milk might give you a tasty end result, but it is not Marcella's sauce. As far as I am concerned this recipe is perfect as written . No changes necessary.","1508867959","856"
"17582394","Lorraine","I am making this right now and it is going great. I really just wanted to say that I love the expression, ""laziest of simmers"".","1508870501","817"
"16690686","Patricia Garcia","Marcella hailed from the Northern Adriatic coast, where seafood was the most commonly available.  She only learned to cook after she was married, trying to please Victor, who was and is an oenophile.  She was a gifted cook.  I wonder how many of the complainers bothered with the nutmeg...it is the most defining flavor in a true Bolognese sauce, which this most definitely is","1509376877","743"
"17097426","Charlie","I've been making this for over 30 years.  I cook it exactly for 5 hours.  The difference in the taste when you cook it for 3 hours (more bland) and 5 hours is incredible and well worth the time.  It ends up being a thick, concentrated sauce that you don't pour on top of the pasta but that you toss into the pasta.","1508867747","610"
"16530700","Max","Holy goodness. I'm amazed at the number of people who are absolutely sure that the version of Bolognese that they prefer is the one, true, authentic version. I imagine there are as many variations as there are kitchens in Bologna, folks. <br/><br/>If I could add anything to the conversation, it would be to throw a little starchy pasta water in with the sauce and pasta as they are being tossed together, and really bring it all together.","1509375822","501"
"30344688","Amanda","No; it's just a signal that it's finished cooking (""ready to eat""). When sauce cooks long enough that the fat separates it 1) improves the taste of the ingredients, and 2) improves the appearance of the dish. Separated fat looks and tastes beautiful in a dish--it often takes on the deepest colors and flavors in the pot, and is one measure that separates an amateur's dish from a professional's. So, yes! The fat is meant to stay in the pot!","1548518885","456"
"18317247","marcolius","I've made this sauce many times, and I like it for what it is.  I love to doctor things, too, but sometimes a classic is a classic.  That being said, I would add two observations:<br/>-Fresh, blanched, peeled, and chopped tomatoes work well, too.  Lean toward longer cooking time.  Haven't needed to add water when using fresh.<br/>-I finely mince the vegetables, particularly the carrot and celery.  Otherwise, it has a ""beef stew"" appearance that my family finds less appealing.","1508873936","428"

"17442622","anne","Marcella Hazan's recipe for ragù is a total classic,easy to make and freezes perfectly.I use veal and do not add any milk,I add two leaves of alloro (bay leaf) which her original recipe has.Canned tomatoes should be put through a tomato passer to get out the seeds which make a sauce bitter and best of all use San Marzano canned tomatoes if you can (they should be from the ""Agro Sarnese Nocerino DOP"" with numbers on the label, otherwise they are not real San Marzano tomatoes)...","1508870127","310"

"20550889","Brian Dear","The best suggestion is to not use low-fat meat. It's a meat sauce and thus the meat is the most critical component. The fat reacts with the milk and the wine -- reducing the fat content reduces the ability for the chemical reactions to happen.<br/><br/>This recipe is all about the fat and the reactions with the acidity of the tomatoes, the alcohol in the wine and the sugars in the vegetables along with the enzymes in the milk.","1508887026","276"
"20449620","Annie","Marcella was the queen of Italian Cooking,  I learned to cook from her when I was a bride and there is not one of her recipes that have failed me.  This one is a regular around our house;  occasionally instead of ground pork I will use Italian sausage removed form its casing for added flavor.  So, between Marcella and Julia, I turned out to be a pretty good cook, and now with NYTimes Cooking I am still learning and improving.","1508887848","259"
"18312358","AZ","Delicious - here are my tips: doubled recipe (cooks down a lot), used 1.5 lbs of beef/pork/veal blend, used 2 28 oz cans of plum tomatos, chopped up (closer to 4 cups) and also threw in the juice from one can. I discarded the juice from the other.  This was the perfect amount for some extra flavor. I cooked for 5.5 hours - this sauce REALLY needed time. I left a lot of time between each layer (milk, wine, tomatoes) - upwards of 30 min each. It looked weird until about 4 hours in. So perfect!","1508874075","253"
"29927659","Jdsans","wanted to add something to my review from a couple days ago.  My observation is that something magic happens after hour 4 of the final cooking phase.  That's when the flavors deepen.  You taste it a couple hours earlier, and you think, ""ok, but I don't see what all the fuss is about."" However, after hour 4 is when you taste it and you don't really have words, just sounds to describe it.  Your knees might even buckle a little.","1546043081","207"
"16468926","Kevin","The order in which you add the wine and milk is a major difference between the original recipe and the one Marcella published in her single volume Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking.  I prefer the original recipe, wine first then milk.","1509376036","173"
"17021109","Uneelle","Sorry, but it's not the least bit surprising that substituting turkey for beef (or preferably beef and pork) led to a disappointing outcome.  Turkey has very little flavor and even less fat (fat = flavor!).  Outcome is destined to be bland.","1509379118","145"
"16118020","Marylouise","Most Americans are convinced that ""Italian"" food means red gravy with lots of mozzarella and ricotta. That is really ""Italian American"" food. Italy has many regions and most Italian American food is based on southern Italian food (where the majority of Italian immigrants came from). Marcella is more of northern Italian cook. And her Bolognese is the best.","1509374941","138"
"20221780","Brian","It will very a lot depending on your pan and stove, but for me the milk took about 25 minutes and the wine about 25 minutes.","1508884983","112"
"24638058","JW","Terrific recipe. Made as directed today. Note that it will take approximately 30-40 minutes to simmer away the milk, and the same to simmer away the wine.","1509334637","100"

"21940452","Patricia","You should add only enough water to keep the sauce from sticking to the bottom of the pot-- no more than 1/2 cup at a time. It's important to pour the water down the side of the pot so that it does not toughen the meat. Continue stirring occasionally and only add more water if the sauce is about to stick. Be sure that by the time you finish cooking the sauce, all the water has evaporated.","1506864238","94"

"25361885","Daisy","Lord forgive me- I altered a 5-star recipe, but I had to add garlic. I HAD to! AND I REGRET NOTHING!   Not sure how it would have turned out w 1 hour of simmering, but the results after 5 hours were absolutely amazing. Make it on a day when you're tooling around the house, cleaning, watching tv, etc and you have the time to tend to this dish. It's totally worth it.  I used 85:15 beef and didn't have any fat to skim- not that I would have anyway...","1514497454","80"
"21230271","Steve in DC","Incredible recipe. We've been making it since we were married in 1989. We do at least 10-15 batches a year. The only change we make is cooking it longer. It was my stepdad's favorite recipe when he was in the nursery home the last months of his life and he said he hadn't tasted one better even in Italy when he was Consul Generale in Rome and Trieste in the 1950s and 1960!","1508859260","70"
"103917366","Marianne","We have been making this sauce for 35 years, and it is still a treat, notwithstanding changes in food fashion.  There is one thing that is absolutely essential to making this sauce come alive, however.  Marcella tells us in her book to be careful not to over-brown the meat.  Cook it just until it begins to lose its pink color.  Any further, and the sauce will taste like ashes flavored with tomato. I know.  I have made that mistake!","1575230590","70"

"25584593","Chloe","I have made this sauce many times with fantastic results. Today, I felt inspired by Kenji's (The Food Lab) bolognese recipe and made a slight change - after adding the tomatoes, I put my dutch oven directly in the oven (preheated to 300F) and let it simmer uncovered for 3 hours. It was INCREDIBLE - even better than Hazan's original recipe (if I dare say so), with a more complex, rich flavor.","1516144854","60"

"21034475","Anna","I've made this sauce several times, usually in a hurry and have cut corners. <br/><br/>Today, I made it and simmered for an extra hour than recommended. The richness and complexity that the extra hour added was just amazing. Highly recommend.","1508858829","56"
"24808284","Brooklyn Brett","I'm puzzled by the penultimate sentence about no water being left in the sauce and the fat separating. How is one to know if any water is left in the sauce? And is the recipe saying that the fat will separate and rise to the top of the sauce and then must be removed?","1510510232","55"
"16671538","scotch37","Coat pappardelle with this sauce, add a touch of butter, pasta cooking water, and shave parm.     It is glorious.      There's another version with a touch of chicken livers, which is over the top good.","1509377043","53"
"25346747","Julie","Do yourself a favor - if you double the recipe, make sure to use a wider pot! Otherwise it will take you much longer to simmer off the milk and the wine. I should know better, but here’s hoping someone can learn from my mistake! We’ll be eating slightly less flavorful sauce tonight as I think serving dinner at 11 would be frowned upon in this house.","1514334722","53"
"24085210","Mary","I am now sunk. EVERYONE loves this sauce. So no more quick weeknight Bolognese for us. This recipe is time consuming but so worth it. I thought my guests were going to lick the pot clean. I used fresh made pappardelle from Whole Foods and it was perfect. Worthy of a dinner party or a very appreciative family. A real keeper!","1508764973","52"
"16302928","Janet","I discovered this recipe in Marcella's original ""Classic"" book and have been making it for years. I never use butter and often substitute veal for beef. It is a beautiful sauce -- mellow from the milk and rich and complex from the combination of nutmeg, tomatoes and wine.  I recommend using it in Marcella's lasagna (also in her original cookbook) that combines tHe Bolognese sauce with bechamel.  Also freezes well.","1509375669","50"
"16513171","Tim","Northern Italian cuisine really has more in common with that of France - lots of milk and butter - than does the fare in the South, the region of origin for most Italian immigrants. Look at a map: Bologna is in the North. Expect the cucina bolognesa to have lots of ""dubiously Italian"" items, it's not the same Italy as Naples or Sicily.","1509375905","49"
"16674905","Mels","""Salsa alla bolognese"" is Italian for Bolognese sauce—the literal translation of 'salsa' is sauce, in both Italian and Spanish. I think Anne was just pointing out that for a sauce to be considered a Bolognese, it doesn't have basil, thyme, and rosemary. Bolognese is meant to be mildly flavored, rich meat sauce. The inclusion of basil and other herbs is more in line with Southern Italian (and Italian American) cooking.","1509376792","49"
"17376790","Liz","This is a rich sauce, no question. I have never tried it with 80% beef, but I can see that with so high a fat content the result might be greasy. (I have made it successfully with turkey and non-fat milk.) You might chill the sauce and remove the hardened fat. But it is also true that American spaghetti sauce is usually spooned on very generously, while this sauce is meant to be used more sparingly: the noodles should show under a coating of sauce, like varnish rather than paint.","1508867807","43"
"30624295","Jonathan","I've been making this recipe for 3 years with minor variations.  I once made it without milk thinking ""oh, I don't need to go back to the store for that"".  I was wrong.  The richness of the fatty flavor in the whole milk/creme is necessary, and it also seems to help it bind to the pasta.  It tasted fine without, but it wasn't the same...  Also, feel free to pour as much wine in as you like.  I usually put in half a bottle or a bit more depending on how dry the white is.  Then drink the rest.","1550177913","42"
"29850495","JRR","I made this a few years ago for friends who brought their young son to dinner. They explained ahead of time that he had rather picky eating habits, but loved Italian food.

"103845973","Tamara","It basically means to let the milk (or anything that is supposed to bubble or simmer away) evaporate.

For the love of god, don’t freelance or second-guess this recipe. don’t use low-fat ground beef or ground turkey. Don’t make it with low-fat milk or ersatz “milk” made from nuts. Don’t throw in garlic or any other random stuff. Don’t skimp on the cook time. If your stove can’t manage a super-low simmer, try one of those flame reducer things.   FOLLOW THE RECIPE.","1612820205","32"
"16108881","John","""No butter!"" ""No milk!""?  Please.  We should all know by now Italian cooking has lots of internal variation (by region and by mamma).  This one is close to that of the 'Accademia Italiana della Cucina"" (with butter and milk) while the Cucchiaio d'Argento  calls for none of that.  A simple search for ""ragù alla bolognese latte"" comes up with lots of Italian sources using this ingredient.  Make it with pork, or without, or with whatever strikes you as Italian.  Probably, someone in Italy does too.","1509374043","31"

"17245589","Alison","Yes, this one is a keeper. Cooked it for a dinner party, and everyone loved it. Caution: it takes quite a while to cook--waiting for the milk to evaporate, then the wine, then the three hours of tomato cook-down. I doubled it and it fed seven hungry people, and that's all. Served with salad and bread. Worth the time, and it's not hard at all, just time-consuming.","1508868905","29"

Actually, Marcella Hazan, Italian born in 1924 was a cooking writer.  Much as Julia Childs introduced home cooks to French cooking, she did for Italian traditional cooking.

"16099671","Franny","My family loves this sauce.   The milk is not apparent in the finished product, it just brings a lovely mellowness to the meat.  Not a lot of work for a very sophisticated taste.  Like many Marcella Hazan recipes, slow reductions build the complex flavor.  The Alice Waters recipe mentioned in comments is also wonderful, and very similar in execution.","1509374056","27"

"25985658","Marky Mark","*curious too, ha ha.   I did some additional research & if anyone else is interested, apparently according to Italian food rules (law?)  Official ""Bolognese"" is strictly limited to the ingredients used in Marcella's recipe.  No garlic or herbs are permitted.

Of course, ""La polizia di cibo Italia"" will likely not invade your kitchen if you add whatever makes you happy, LOL.","1518736652","25"
"30385292","Sean","@Chris  It specifically says you add the water to prevent sticking, not to keep the fat from separating.   In this case, you want the fat to separate. You'll stir it up to coat the sauce with a little bit of fat, then toss with the starchy pasta, and this will help the sauce adhere to the pasta. ","1548787136","25"
"30659519","R. Craton","When you add the milk or wine, there is already liquid in the pan that is a combination of fat and some water. Water evaporates and (pure) fat does not.

You'll be duly rewarded! <br/><br/>As others have said: If this takes you less than 5 hours, yeah, you're doing it wrong. Milk and wine steps alone took over an hour. Slow and low (heat) after that. <br/><br/>Taste for seasoning towards the end, as the sauce cooks down; flavors get super concentrated and you don't want to wind up overly salting. <br/><br/>And DO add butter to the pasta. You came this far - indulge! SO worth it.","1506883938","22"
"29473581","Em","I didn't have white wine on hand and I used red wine instead and found that it yielded a very rich flavorful sauce. I made it a second time with white wine and it came out tasting more like the standard authentic bolognese that we all know and love but if you want to change things up I definitely recommend trying this variation.","1542744582","22"
"30261286","DrMike","Step 4 in recipe states ""at the end, no water at all must be left and the fat must separate from the sauce"" - does one keep just the sauce and discard the separated fat?  Unclear directions here ...","1548102591","22"
"30434996","B Barclift","I have been making Marcella’s Bolognese since the 1980s. I was sad to find my 1983 reprint of The Classic Italian failed to include a hand written note dating my maiden voyage with the recipe. This Bolognese never fails. Part of my enjoyment lies in the pleasure of the sauce silently simmering for hours on the cook top. The anticipation of what lies ahead is fantastic. As an aside, I always use fresh Romas and homemade pasta... and a nice Vino Nobile. Buon Appetito!","1549049614","22"
"19304659","Tom","Low, even heat and patience is key. If using gas, you need a large and heavy vessel. Letting the added liquid bubble away should involve some stirring, until the free liquid has reduced into the sauce.<br/><br/>""The laziest of simmers"" can be hard to achieve, since pots are too small, don't spread heat and so heat the sauce too much, breaking it.<br/>An enameled cast iron pot that seems too large works well. A heat diffuser might help.","1508880232","21"

"102780090","Janet","I have made Marcella Hazan’s Bolognese sauce for years -  it is always fantastically delicious. However, this NYT adaptation reverses the order in which the milk and wine are added. The wine needs to be added first so it can reduce and flavor the meat. The milk should be added after the wine since it does not reduce fully. This is fine because it helps the sauce retain moisture. If the wine is added after the milk, the wine never fully reduces which negatively affects the flavor of the sauce.","1569611475","17"

Instead of simmering on the stovetop, I put my Dutch oven in the oven on 300-325. This allowed the top to brown, and I intermittently scraped the caramelization around the edges into the sauce to enhance flavor.  At the end I gradually added fish sauce to taste! No more than a tbsp. Doesn’t taste fishy, but enhances the umami! Trust me :)","1552201144","7"

"116993462","JRTHiker","This is a classic central to northern Italian Bolognese.  If you're used to garlic and more intense flavors of the southern Italian and American Italian sauces and meats, you'll think this is bland.   But it's how it is in Italy.   And frequently in the Emilia-Romagna, Le Marche, and Abruzzo areas they use a very light hand with garlic, and keep it separate from onions.  The soffritto (carrots/celery/onions) without garlic is a classic sauce base of these centro regions.","1645209734","6"

"104587390","Mindy","I make this sauce all the time. No, you cannot skimp on the time. It usually takes me 5 hours, and so worth it.  It takes about 45 minutes each for steps 3 and 4. It is important to do them as instructed because the milk coats the beef so that it doesn't get acidy when you add the tomatoes. This sauce has a wonderful sweet taste (from the carrots). It usually takes me 5 hours, and so worth it.","1578843971","3"

Also don’t forget to add salt when first sautéing the meat, because she says that helps extract meat juices, and lean meat will make the ragù less “sweet”.  So just follow this recipe as is.","1629818792","3"

In my opinion, best with pappardelle.","1676072290","3"

This takes a significant amount of time on its own. This really tenderizes the meat before adding the tomato component. From beginning to end this recipe typically takes me about 6 hours. Its an all day affair and the result is worth it.","1696524141","3"
"128300649","Rocky","Yes, no garlic.  The authentic preparation does NOT use garlic.  Tomatoes are not the star of the dish, yet play an important supporting role.  The sweetness could have come from the carrots, but unlikely.  Be careful what kind of white wine you use.  Try it again.  This is a classic prep that you should not fold on the first time around.","1696720963","3"

It's worth doubling or tripling the recipe and freezing the leftovers. What a treat - the kind of Bolognese you'd hope for at a good Italian restaurant.  A few notes: Some reviewers said it's bland, but I found it just needed more salt at the end after the sauce reduced. I followed the recipe exactly except I doubled it and added 2 bay leafs, which added a little something.","1704337868","3"
"130604916","Stella Carrozzo","I imagine that this way of preparing Bolognese is special, and delicious, but being completely allergic to white wine (and, to tell the truth, being Italian and a little too close to family tradition), I use red wine. Carrots are absolutely essential, and are part of the traditional Bolognese recipe (from centuries ago, proudly preserved by the Bolognese). But, in addition, the carrot reduces the acidity of the tomato and meat, which is commendable.","1705857717","3"

Nothing to do with what we cook in Italy, vegetables and minced meat (1/3 beef,1/3 veal, 1/3 pork) has to be cooked separately till they brown to have Maillard's reaction well done. Then you join all, if you like to add wine add it to the meat and let it evaporate all. Then you add triple concentrated tomato paste, stir well and cook. At this moment you will add milk and two leaves of bay and some rosemary well tied together (bouquet garni). Let it sips slowly for 2/3 h.","1705859717","3"

It distributes the heat evenly across the bottom of the pot and vastly lowers the chances of the sauce sticking and burning. Diffusers are not expensive and can be used with either electric or gas burners.  Also, pouring added water down the sides of the pot helps heat the water so it doesn't slow cooking and speeds it where needed at the bottom.","1705955387","3"

I agree with others that the cooking time will be much longer if you actually wait till each added liquid cooks off completely, but this is well worth doing! Because turkey is so lean, you also cannot skimp on the butter or use anything other than whole milk. That being said, even with turkey, this recipe is outstanding!","1577050265","2"

Although the original recipe had the wine added before the milk, I've found adding the milk first is better in terms of ensuring the acid from the wine doesn't toughen the milk. If the milk starts to boil/foam too much, just add another quarter cup of milk.   The longer you can simmer this recipe, the better. One time I made it to six hours and that sauce was divine.","1586217568","2"

Noting that it takes about 1 hour to get to step 4, so if you started cooking a bit late, when you get to step 4, you can eat it with minimal reduction in quality after one hour of cooking.

The only thing I changed was I had some mushrooms that needed using up so added those to the veggie dice in the beginning. I salt and peppered as I went and used a dry white wine.

One-half cup of milk. 1 cup white wine (I usually use ¾ cup with fine results).  Pepper isn't mentioned. It is the purest, most remarkable Bolognese in existence. And if you order it in a restaurant, ask if the beef is cooked in milk. If not, it's not real Bolognese.","1696174993","2"
"128126272","Pieter","I tried this once without the pork. It was okay, but the flavor was oddly flat.  Much better with the pork, in my opinion! Absolutely go with the pork/ground beef mix!","1696176054","2"
"128134664","Claytronica","Classic.  I do reduce the ratio of carrot in the mirepoix to avoid too much sweetness.  And I prefer all pork and often add minced chicken livers for earthiness - but you can't go wrong.  This recipe is very receptive to tweaking.","1696206381","2"
"128164887","Dan","The milk, then the  nutmeg (don't skip it), then the wine. The alcohol dissolves and disperses flavor compounds in the nutmeg that milk does not; best not to evaporate it away before adding the spice.","1696296800","2"
"128172810","Alison","This is a perfect recipe. If you run out of time (or don’t plan ahead), I’ve found that 20 minutes on high pressure in the Instapot can credibly swap for the 3 hours of stovetop bubbling (swirl in butter at the end, briefly set to sauté if liquid ratio too high).","1696338521","2"
"128268470","Richard","No. There will be oil from cooking the onions and rendered fat from the meat.","1696605190","2"
"128289202","Richard","No garlic or spice needed in this fantastic dish. The long simmer develops all the flavor that is needed.","1696690271","2"
"128449794","JBandK9s","So delicious tossed with pappardelle and topped with fresh parm-reggiano, a definite keeper! I doubled the recipe and used a mix of chuck/pork/veal. The large 28oz can of San Marzano tomatoes was perfect for the double recipe. Sacrilege, I added a couple cloves of minced garlic to the veggies, NOT sorry, yum. Took a good 40 minutes to simmer off the milk and another 40 to simmer off the (good, dry) white wine. Well worth the time to slowly simmer to perfection, thank you Marcella.","1697288909","2"
"128567522","Morganne","This is an incredible sauce… Everyone raved about it. The flavor is so complex with the beef/pork/wine/tomato umami. Worth all of the effort. I quadrupled the recipe and it was devoured by all 20 people (kids and adults) at our dinner party. No leftovers to be seen.","1697730450","2"

"129357650","DBL","I had no idea how hot my gas stove runs until my “laziest of simmers,” even after an hour all the way on low, still had little channels of constant bubbling. Eventually I stacked the grate from the other side of the stove onto top of the grate I was using, doubling the distance from the heat. MUCH better.   At 1 hour’s simmer sauce was great; at 2 hours’, too sweet (added pepper and a little salt); at 3 hours, perfect-tasting and texturally smooth.","1700850113","2"
"129820384","Linda Grimes","Well, this was a complete bust.  I am considered an excellent cook and know my way around a kitchen.  What a huge disappointment.  I followed the recipe to the letter and I tried to doctor it up as we were having a dinner guest.  It was so bland...I added chopped fresh basil and some red pepper flakes to try to boost the flavor.  And then there's the grease!  It was so gross I just had to drain part of it off...unbelievable.  Needless to say, 20,000+ people don't agree with me,","1702665343","2"
"129932503","Jon G","Instant classic. Take it slow. If you drink half a bottle of wine while prepping it you are going at the right speed. Added a little extra umami with a tablespoon of porcini powder when adding the meat. I did 2:1:1 beef:pork:veal. Texture and as fantastic and so was the richness. Also don’t skip on using the best pasta you can find.","1703099064","2"
"130009560","Michelle D.","Phenomenal and well worth the time.  The only additions/deviations I made were to season with kosher salt and fresh pepper at every stage, added a fair amount of garlic, and added 1/2 cup of reserved pasta water when I tossed the sauce with the pasta.   Really special. I wish I had tripled it so I had batches to freeze.","1703379851","2"
"130598348","PJ Ray","Veganized it with a package of impossible beef and half a roll of impossible sausage. Plant based heavy cream instead of milk. Holy moly it was good. Omnivorous husband can’t stop eating it either.","1705811701","2"
"130602670","Brady","I made a double batch of this sauce, then made two pans of lasagna with it and served it at a party we had years ago. Everyone...and I do mean every single guest raved about it and those pans were empty in no time at all.","1705853358","2"
"130602902","Justin D","I love this recipe. I love it even more when I add some (cooked, chopped) chicken livers to the meat before starting in on the liquids, as some Bolognese cooks will do. It helps make the texture creamier and deepens umami flavor. The final sauce does not taste 'liverish.'","1705853776","2"

"130610250","Richard X","Marcella changed her mind over the years and published both versions. She apparently didn't think one way was more right than the other.","1705872542","2"
"130610383","Richard X","New to cooking or not, be aware that this is a meat sauce, not a tomato sauce. It is not meant to be liquidy. The sauce should coat the pasta meagerly. It's not ""spaghetti sauce"" as many Americans think of it. The recipe states that, at the end, no water should be left. That goes for the tomato juices as well. It's not meant to be a ""wet"" sauce. If you're looking for a liquidy tomato sauce, there are recipes out there that will deliver that.","1705873115","2"
"130612087","Richard X","Marcella published it both ways. ""Yet her two published recipes are not identical. In the earlier book, when the sauce is composed and simmering, Marcella adds the wine and, after cooking it down, adds the milk. The later book instructs you to add the milk first, then the wine. See the printed recipe.""

"130613582","Ron H.","I agree with the many who point out that the recipe she published in her book calls for wine first, then the milk.  I think it makes a difference...the final result seems fuller, softer, and more flavorful.","1705889624","2"

"130633107","Richard X","Don't be sorry. You should simply recognize that the authentic method of making Bolognese Ragu is to use milk!","1705967032","2"

"130891957","Cecilia","Tripled recipe which also tripled the time needed for liquids to evaporate. Once tomatoes were added, I allowed it to lazily simmer for 4 hours. Added 1/2 cup water with in the 4 hours.

Combined cooked pappardelle, 1/2 tblsp butter, and 1 cup of sauce. Divided into 2 servings and served with Parmesan. A lot of work but excellent results.","1706889668","2"
"131176312","Cindy Slane","I used ground turkey for this recipe (my spouse doesn't eat beef), but added a little fat by crisping two slices of diced, lean, uncured bacon in the pan before adding the butter and oil to sautée the chopped onions. (I'd have used pancetta instead, but didn't have any on hand.) Cooking down, first the milk, and then the wine, took longer than predicted, but, then, I had increased the recipe by 1/3 to have left-over sauce for freezing.  The sauce was absolutely first-rate with fresh fettucini.","1707964411","2"
"131177109","For the Earth","Made it vegan by adding plant based meat, oat milk, and vegan butter.  Doubled the recipe, and added close to a cup of butter to replace the fats. 'Twas so delicious!","1707968282","2"
"131274310","Absolutely Awful","I have no idea why everybody raves over this recipe. It is inedible. I tried everything to ‘doctor it up’ to make it palatable, but it was just unpleasant, greasy, and generally inedible. I cannot imagine serving this to anyone.","1708381756","2"
"131327318","sam","This was delicious. You have to stay home and cook this so you can continue to stir and add water every 30 minutes or so, but in winter, I don’t really mind. I added about 3 cups of water over the course of 3-4 hours as the sauce was simmering. I tasted it and added more salt to taste. I used shellbows/lumache, and they carried the thick sauce well. I do wish this could have a little more umami, so maybe I’ll throw in some mushrooms next time. Stick with all the tedious steps. Worth it!","1708565633","2"
"131600975","reader","Cook as written. Garlic is not an ingredient in a bolognese sauce and not in everything Italian. Italian-American cooking, maybe, but not Italy. There are many regions and styles of cooking. Expand your horizons and open your mind. This is perfect.","1709569234","2"
"131646027","Liz Friedman","I follow the recipe almost exactly as written, except I put in a 28oz can of tomatoes (I think the guy in the NYT video put that much in). This sauce is PHENOMENAL!!! As other commenters said, definitely cook for more than 3 hours, preferably 5.","1709682676","2"

"133634540","S.","Never saw a bolognaise recipe with milk (and without garlic nor thyme) so was curious to try. The result is disappointing - it’s way too sweet, and generally very bland and boring.

"135731137","Bridget G.","I wasn't sure how to tell if the liquids had boiled away, so I wrote to NYT Cooking. Here's what they said: ""The bubbling of liquids will change as the liquid reduces. At first, the bubbling will be vigorous, but as the liquid level decreases, the bubbles will become smaller and more intermittent. You should look for the liquid to become thicker and more syrupy. If you see a thick, concentrated residue rather than a liquid, it's a good sign that most of the liquid has evaporated.""","1724706215","2"
