"16530651","William Wroblicka","I think this recipe is unnecessarily fussy. The difference between the two kinds of flours is their protein content -- bread flour has 12.7% (per King Arthur Flour's website), cake flour has 9.4%, and all-purpose flour has 11.7%. The amounts of flour called for in the recipe are equal by weight, so the protein content of the combined bread and cake flours is 11.05%, which is practically the same as all-purpose flour. So I just used plain, old AP flour and the cookies turned out fine.","1509376163","4873"

"19547155","Cwarriner","I learned a trick from Cooks Illustrsted that I have used for several recipes, including CC cookies. Use cold butter. Place about 2/3 of butter in a skillet, melt and then lightly brown the butter. Pour browned butter over cold butter in mixing bowl and mix until cold butter is melted. Mix in sugars (1/2 Lt brown and 1/2 Dk brown), salt, eggs and vanilla. Mix thoroughly, then allow to sit for 3 minutes. Mix 30 seconds, then repeat twice. Then continue with recipe. Sugars develop beautifully!","1508881573","1177"
"16067212","Pam","I LOVE this recipe!  It is true that people absolutely go crazy for these cookies!  I have adapted the recipe over the years, including pre-scooping the cookies onto a wax paper-lined cookie sheet and refrigerating them prior to baking.  I find it much easier to do it this way than trying to scoop cold dough.  I bake what I want and put the rest in a zip-lock bag to bake later.  These cookies are the best the day you bake them.  I agree with Jenny W, you will be making them again, and again!","1509374899","644"
"18482412","Eileen Fry","I'm not a big fan of CC cookies, but now I know it's because I have not had the best. OMG! This is THE only recipe you'll ever need. It is chewy and crisp on the outside. I used all purpose flour as the others suggested. I immediately baked the dough since I wanted to taste the difference. It was great! However, the longer the dough rested in the fridge the better it tasted. I baked it at 6 hours, 24 & 48 hours. Let me tell ya, it tasted the best after it has rested for 48.","1508875041","586"
"19064376","Eileen Fry","I've been making this for over 2 months now and will pass on this recipe for generations. Simply the best! This is an update to my previous post. All purpose flour is what I use for this recipe and it's perfect! However, tonight I used the cake and bread flour as the recipe suggested. What a mistake! The cookie was on the heavier side and it's more cakey. My kids wondered what happened and demanded the original cookie. Will definitely be sticking to all purpose flour from now on.","1508879981","501"
"16087198","Caroline","I want to try those but I'm scared with the amount of sugar listed in the recipe. 450g sugar for 18 cookies? It means 25g sugar per cookie, almost 2 tablespoons?! Is there a way to put less sugar in the dough without changing the consistency of the final result? Thanks!","1509374446","411"
"21843685","Alice","I've found it works really well rolling the dough into logs, wrapping with greaseproof paper, then cling flim, and freezing. Then I just slice off (through the wrapping) cookie segments about 1 1/2 inches thick, and bake from frozen.","1506863654","396"
"20229959","Laura","How much flour would I use if I use all purpose flour only and no cake flour? Thanks!","1508885457","342"
"21022800","kristen","so if you use all purpose flour, what is the total amount used?  also do you let the butter reach room temp and soften before mixing?","1508859028","237"
"16494178","Fast Eddie","I have made this cookie twice. I have found two things,<br/>First I can jam a lot of chocolate, white chocolate and nuts into this recipe, but it try not to exceed the recommended amount of recommended chocolate. However these are big cookies and can hold a lot of fillings. I use 3 types of chocolate, white chocolate and walnuts, but I think  pecans would be better.<br/><br/>Do not over bake, I found that on a good baking sheet with a good silicon sheet, that 14 to 15 min is perfect for a nice soft cookie.","1509376197","235"
"23585284","Min","Tip: heeding the advice of other commenters, I rolled the cookie dough into 4 logs, wrapped in plastic wrap, and then stuck it in the fridge. The next day, I just cut disks of the cookie dough (fairly easily), sprinkled sea salt, and stuck it in the oven. So easy and you don't have to struggle with hard cookie dough! I highly recommend, even if you don't have bread or cake flour!","1506879883","221"
"17410849","Mistytailady","Great recipe!  I followed it with the exception of some recommendations from readers:  used a mixture of bittersweet, semisweet, and white chocolate; before chilling for 36 hours, I formed smaller than golfball-size balls and placed them in a large covered bowl (cannot imagine how hard it would be to work with the chilled, unformed dough); baked them on parchment lined baking sheets for 10 minutes before sprinkling a tiny pinch of flaked sea salt, then baked 5 minutes more.","1508870415","215"
"17372878","cj","Make 50 gram cookies (just under 2 ounces; a bit smaller than a golf ball), cook for 15 minutes. Flat disks work better than chips; the chocolate melts into layers. Use 10 ounces bittersweet and 10 ounces semisweet chocolate disks for a more complex flavor. The cookies should be puffy and starting to brown when you take them out of the oven. Using parchment paper makes it easy to transfer cookies from baking sheet to rack to cool further; let them cool completely before removing from parchment.","1508867502","167"
"15886936","jenny w","I have made this so many times and every time people go CRAZY for them! I use Trader Joes chocolate that comes in a huge bar and then just chop it up with a butcher knife. This works perfectly and is very cost effective! Also, some of my people hate the salt on top, so I try to be fairly judicious when sprinkling it! Once you have made these you are going to be busy making them again and again and again and again and again!!!","1509372838","166"
"16112459","Claire","Did you weigh the ingredients? That can make a tremendous difference. Also, I form the dough into balls before I chill it. Otherwise it breaks into little dough pebbles when I try to scoop it. Worth trying if you haven't already.","1509374792","134"
"15153130","RickMichigan","Bread flour (1 cup = 4.25 oz) weighs more than Cake flour (1 cup = 3.53 oz) which is the reason it looks like a discrepancy.  It took me a while to figure that out also.","1509370710","132"
"20576642","Jeff Wright","-Two bags of Trader Joe's chocolate chunks is perfect.<br/>-Instead of two flours, I use AP but replace 2T cornstarch for every cup to keep the gluten from going crazy.<br/>-I experimented with cold cure time and so far, 4 weeks results in a cookie that is incredibly sublime, with or without salt sprinkles. The butter calms down after about a week's cure.<br/>-Hand rolling ping pong ball sized before chilling works best, throw them in a large muffin tin for more edge crumb and chewy goodness.","1508887422","115"
"16743057","Sue","I've made these as written except: regular flour, no sifting, and refrigerated 24H before baking. Still the best cookies I've ever made.","1509376980","112"

"21850699","Nicole Lee","Sure, it's a little more time consuming than other cookies, but if you want to make friends and be super popular, do it exactly as the recipe is written. However, I use Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate chips. They are disc shaped and they are not as sweet as other chips.  This is an amazing, perfect and special cookie and should not be altered.  Call me ridiculous,but I think of it as a work of art.  If you think it's too fussy and time consuming, just stick with Toll House.","1506863345","100"
"16212551","Margaux Laskey, Staff Editor @ NYT Cooking","It freezes beautifully.","1509374089","94"
"16113830","Jilli Robertson","I went for ""normal"" size cookies, using a tablespoon size scoop (so old it is not numbered as they are now). The recipe made 7 dozen cookies. That would change the calculus considerably. Those are giant cookies! I used all-purpose Southern flour for the cake flour (White Lily).","1509374939","93"
"14973903","Michele","Coarse sea salt, listed in this recipe, does not work as well as flaked sea salt....perhaps that is what is required to keep it from melting into the cookies?","1509369863","84"
"27134339","Megan","I've made these cookies many times, and I do not think I'll ever use another recipe for the go-to chocolate chip. Using both kinds of flours is a must. I have made the cookies multiple times with all-purpose flour and multiple times with the bread/cake flours. The AP flour cookies turn out fine, but never great; always have good flavor, but pretty hard. With the bread/cake flours they have perfect give in the middle and crunch around the edges; suddenly they go from fine to amazing.","1526619505","84"
"17309219","Danielle","This seems like it should maybe not be categorized ""easy""?","1508868364","75"
"23714170","Nico M.","I thought these cookies were pretty good overall, however I had a slight problem with how much salt the recipe says to put in the dough. I put the 1.5 teaspoons of salt in the dough and found that the cookies when baked had a salty aftertaste. I recommend putting 1 teaspoon of salt in the dough for a less salty cookie. I don't know if other people like their cookies slightly salty, but I would just like to put this out there for people who are making this recipe for the first time.","1506884270","73"
"30032674","KT B","I've made these at least 5X now.. They are the BEST chocolate cookies I have ever had. EVER.  I go to a Portland ME fav called Scratch Bakery, if anyone has ever gone there you KNOW it's great, but their chocoate chip cookies can't touch these. This is my second kudo to the recipe so I won't do another, but I just also want to add, I've done them with bread/cake/all all purpose, dark brown, light brown, Costco vanilla, Trader Joe vanilla, and they have always always come out awesome.

"30256891","Maria","An awesome cookie with some tweaks. Following the advice of other bakers, use AP flour, reduce sugars by about 1/4 cup, use high quality butter - Kerigold or Kate's and DEFINITELY roll dough into golf ball sized balls BEFORE chilling. This makes about 4 dozen 2 1/2 inch cookies.   I think the recipe calls for way too much chocolate. A 12 ounce bag of 60% cacao chips or chunks is just the right amount for ample and well-distributed chips. I add 1 cup chopped pecans or walnuts.","1548074333","63"
"30557957","Eileen from Walla Walla","Having made these 3 times now does not make me an expert, but I'm getting better! I found if I use coarse salt, it will not sift through in the sifting process and is left behind in the sifter, so I use regular salt. I use a 10-oz bag of Ghirardelli 60% cacao chips and a 10-oz bag of Nestles triple chips (white, milk, and dark). Even my 95-year-old Dad, who has lost his appetite and much weight, can pack away 3 of these at a time and has gained nearly 4 pounds this last month! Thank you Jacques!","1549837256","58"
"23538288","Shanna","Beating the butter and sugar for a good amount of time allows the sugar to disperse and dissolve evenly into the butter. It also puts air into it creating a fluffier texture. I always cream butter and sugar in recipes until the color completely changes and it becomes the texture of almost whipped cream.","1506880341","48"
"15221715","Peter S","I've always loved the Toll House nestles. These are decidedly better, different. Portion shown gives a 5 - 6"" cookie, so I half the amount. I love chop walnuts added for the slightly bitter counterpoint. Add the nuts just before baking and assemble @ room temp. the loosest possible pile of dough, chocolate, etc. w/ a bit of course salt on top- it all melts together. I've frozen them and bake a few at a time. Once baked they hold up for about 2 hours, next day not as good!  Large napkin indeed!","1509370591","45"
"29770569","Betty","This is THE chocolate chip cookie recipe. Tip: for the chocolate, I buy the pound plus Belgian dark chocolate bar from Trader Joe’s and chop it up. The combo of big chunks and tiny splinters of chocolate are amazing in this recipe. (Plus this chocolate is super affordable and delicious). Also - I’ve seen these tips mentioned in other reviews but worth seconding. Just use 17 oz all purpose flour, no need for 2 kinds of flour. Scoop the cookies before refrigerating. ","1545000638","45"
"30273084","Adrienne","If I could add more stars to the rating, I would! I used 17 oz. of all-purpose flour. The cookies were shaped and refrigerated at least 36 hours before baking and at least 6 hours before being served. They were still a bit crunchy on the outside and chewy within - just the way I like a cookie to be.  Somewhere I read that gently compressing the cookies with a spatula the moment they are removed from the oven helps to retain the soft center. A brilliant trick which I will repeat again and again!","1548178753","43"
"19123895","Laura West","FYI - The recipe on the Nestle chocolate chips is not the exact recipe from Ruth Wakefield.  I have an autographed cookbook from the Toll House given to me by my mother 50 years ago.  Ruth Wakefield's recipe calls for 2 oz more of chocolate.  Shame on Nestle!!","1508879398","41"

"100385081","Meg","I noticed that the recipe says to add the flaky sea salt before you bake, but in the video posted on Instagram it looks like the sea salt was added to the cookies after they came out of the oven. Which is correct? Thanks!","1557334801","37"
"18036405","Irene","Next time double the vanilla and sprinkle the tops with salt before baking or increase salt in recipe to at least 2 teaspoons. Baked up chubby and chewy with plenty of chips per bite. Used a tablespoon dough scoop; well chilled dough needed 13 minutes. Pull when still pale, soft in center and just beginning to brown on the edges. Allow to remain on hot baking sheet until just warm. Froze dough balls.","1508871191","34"

"15938427","LeighO","I ended up cooking these right away (teenagers in the house) and using plain old Costco chocolate chips. They were wonderful, somehow both crunchy and chewy at the same time.","1509373577","32"
"30406731","Dorthe ","These are well worth the wait. The sea salt on top really brings out the flavor. I also portion out the dough and put it in the freezer after the original 36 hour refrigeration - they are great immediately, but better at 36 hours.  Hint, to make your own Cake Flour use 1 cup minus 1 tbsp AP flour plus 1 tbsp corn starch OR potato starch. Using the cake flour gives a more tender crumb. If you are watching our cholesterol, you can substitute 1/2 the butter with full fat greek yogurt using a scale.","1548898138","32"

"30769744","Kate","Hi Mariebl, if you brown the butter and let it re-solidify, you will have a puffier cookie due to their increase air you will be able to whip into the batter by using the creaming method. Using liquified butter directly after browning will result in a thinner, chewier cookie as it will partially melt some of the sugars, creating larger crystals and of course, not adding air through creaming.   Here is a good resource that explains it better: <a href=""https://tinyurl.com/y35xbsa8"" target=""_blank"">https://tinyurl.com/y35xbsa8</a>","1551007748","26"

"100662772","mike","I feel like I’ve tried every chocolate chip cookie recipe out there, and nothing comes close to this one. Nothing. Every six months I doubt my loyalty and and seek some new recipe out to try, but it pales in comparison to this one’s brilliance. I use Italian TIP bread flour, and I always put the dough in the refrigerator for 48 hours. It’s totally worth the 2 days of time that stands between you and your perfect cookie. People now call me THE cookie man. RESPECT!","1558862631","23"
"31530489","Bobby","I have been making these nonstop! Recently I started browning the butter and mixing the wet ingredients once that dries. Adds a toffee-like quality to the cookie, and they tend to hold together better.","1555268852","22"

"28908079","Tarah","Yum, yum, yum. I took the advice of Wroblicka and used all AP flour (3 and scant 2/3 c AP flour)  and they were delish. I also took the advice of CWarriner and used the C.I method of melting 2/3 of the butter and browning slightly before adding that to the cold butter and sugar. I used all brown sugar. Glorious! I used only 15 ounces of chocolate chips and thought it was far too many, so I would suggest eye-balling that to your own preferences, as the dough was already quite rich. My fav cookie!","1538761919","19"
"29961330","Deborah","Addendum #2: First batch made with Plugra butter was spectacular, but dough was so stiff it made addition of chocolate discs challenging. To make it easier, I tried recipe with regular (365 brand) butter. No comparison: Plugra cookies had greater depth of flavor + superior texture (chewier inside, crisper outside) with less spread. Reg butter cookies were good, but Plugra cookies were GREAT.","1546381923","19"
"114386006","Chase","I adapted the baking temperature of this to 330 degrees and bake time increased a couple of minutes, only a slight deviation from prescribed in the recipe. I worked at a bakery-cafe chain that uses the same temp for their cookies, and find that it helps develop a beautifully done crust and a soft bite in the middle. As a bonus, it allows for a decreased risk of accidental overbaking. For those who like cookies to be overbaked, ignore this note!","1630732911","19"
"27588438","Pandoraly","I make mini cookies - balls approximately 1.5 inches in diameter.  This recipe makes 7 dozen at that size.  I refrigerate batter for 24 hours, than scoop into balls and freeze for another 12 hours to ? whenever I feel like baking a small batch.  They are still good a month later.  I cook straight out of the freezer at 325 for 16 minutes.  Let sit on hot tray for 5 minutes, then cool completely.  Delicious bite-sized cookies!","1529728360","18"
"29588180","Lisa &amp; Robert","These cookies are a huge hit with our Airbnb guests! Many of their notes say these are the best chocolate chip cookies they've ever had. I use half whole wheat and half AP (ww flour is more substantial and nutty) and Trader Joes chocolate chunks. I scoop 3 oz. of the refrigerated dough, roll into a ball and wrap each with a piece of plastic wrap, then store in ziploc freezer bag in the freezer. Put on cookie sheet from the freezer and bake as directed for warm, perfect cookies every time.","1543692229","18"
"30137635","Katie","I have made this recipe for years and it’s by far my favorite and they come out wonderful. If they are too “full” try a little less flour however I find that I typically use more than the recipe calls for. Also I make the dough balls BEFORE I chill them. That also helps because I freeze them and can pull out a couple cookies at a time for a hot chocolate chip cookie on a cold snowy day! ","1547425568","18"

"24000344","These are amazing","Huge hit every time I make them, do yourselves a favor and use a kitchen scale for measurement of the flours and chocolate.  I also weigh each cookie before putting them on the pan, makes a HUGE difference in outcome.","1508764759","17"
"30869692","JoanC","You owe it to yourself to make these before you die.  They are literally the quintessential chocolate chip cookie - before which all others pale in comparison.  Made as written - and although I only chilled the dough for three hours they were deliciously crisp and chewy.  I wish I'd followed some of the suggestions below: scooping the dough into balls before chilling, and not using quite so many chocolate discs.  Next time!  In a word, fabulous!","1551580411","16"

"106124501","Elaine in San Diego","The unthinkable has happened: my ‘old faithful’ ccc recipe got the boot in favor of this one! It. Is. Sublime. My notes: protein content of the 2 combined flours is similar to all-purp flour, so just use the AP. Also, the nearly two 12-oz bags of choc chips is too much IMHO. A single 12oz bag is perfect. Also, if you do the jumbo size cookies recommenced and freeze them, do disk-shape; in a giant ball, frozen, interior doesn’t bake thru. Finally, they are fine with just 2 hrs refrigeration time.","1585494421","16"
"14810988","Nancy","This is a fantastic recipe.  I don't make them as large as the recipe calls for and they are still crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle.<br/>The first time I made them I put sea salt on them, but it must not have been ""rocky"" enough b/c it melted, so now I omit the salt.","1509368541","15"
"16539676","Adam","I add 1/4 tsp less baking soda and 1/4 tsp more baking powder to get a little more puff.  Agree with others, they hold a lot of fillings (chips/nuts/toffee).  The texture is incredible.  I made one for a work social event, and people talk about them months later. It did take 8 hours to bake the 8 or nine dozen.  I have not tried using just AP flour, but will based on other comments.","1509377098","15"
"16595230","Wendy","This is my new favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe!  I made this recipe using a mix of three types of chocolate-60% cacao chips, white chocolate chips and semi-sweet chocolate chunks, and it has come out great.  Following the other remarks I read before starting, I also made the dough balls before refrigerating and put the extra in the freezer.  They were a big hit with my family and friends.","1509377157","15"
"20479800","Rachel","I made one of these ""stick in the fridge first"" recipes a few months ago and didn't like how the dough was difficult to scoop afterwards, even after coming to room temp.  I am on the fence re the value of putting the prepared dough in the fridge for many hours.  What was very helpful was forming the dough with my trusty Vollrath Size 40 scooper, THEN covering and putting in the fridge to firm up. That way, you can just pop them onto cookie sheets.","1508887335","15"
"24340675","Ms. KMV","As stated in other comments, the recommended bake time made the cookies too crispy. 14-15 minutes seemed to do the trick. ","1507262850","15"
"25464254","Claudia","If you only use wholewheat flour and half the sugar they come out crunchy and very filling in a VERY good way. I highly recommend it","1515353641","15"
"22708022","Best. Ever. Limit over-eating these by freezing dough","Amazing recipe. I promote healthier eating for my job, but I absolutely love cookies! In this case, they are totally worth every bit of salt, sugar and fat... To prevent annihilating my body, I only bake half the recipe and freeze dough for future treats. I freeze them pre-salted and ready to bake. Freeze balls on a cookie sheet and, once frozen, keep in plastic zipper bag. I know that this is not revolutionary, but it bears repeating as a suggestion for tempering cookie monsters like me.","1506870303","14"
"23576812","John","I've been baking these 1-2 times a year ever since the recipe came out (2009?), and they are sensational. I just call them the ""New York Times Cookies,"" and friends and family light up whenever I say I'm about to make a batch. At least 48 hours of chilling and 18 minutes seems to work best for the baking time. Longer than that and they get a bit too brittle. Pop one in the microwave for 5 seconds if any survive the first wave. It will become moist & tender again.","1506880949","14"
"27946322","David Hommel","I added 2 cups of chopped, toasted pecans to the batter. Then, instead of refrigerating the whole batch and trying to scoop cold dough, I laid a piece of plastic wrap out and placed about a quarter of the batch on it then formed a log and rolled it to about 1-1/4"" thick x 15"" long. I put these rolls in the refrigerator overnight then sliced pieces about 1"" thick. I took a quarter cup of demerara sugar mixed with a quarter cup of coarse sea salt and pressed the dough in. Then bake","1532186067","14"
"29813986","Brett","Hi Mara,  Your issue isn't really related to your flour amounts (though it's always good to be as precise as possible when baking), it's with the butter. If you melted your butter in the microwave instead of creaming it with the sugar, you probably ended up with something more like a cookie batter than a dough. That explains why it isn't really scoopable. Creaming the butter allows you to add air to the mixture and mix the solids together without having the liquify the butter.","1545266266","14"

Mix in sugars (1/2 Lt brown and 1/2 Dk brown), salt, eggs and vanilla. Mix thoroughly, then allow to sit for 3 minutes. Mix 30 seconds, then repeat twice. Then continue with recipe.

I’ve baked them immediately and at different hour increments and the flavors really start to emerge beautifully after 36 hours. I will also say that the cake and bread flour mixture produces better results than all purpose. The only thing I change is using slightly less chocolate and forming them into balls before refrigerating.","1614267915","12"

Since contrast between crisp exterior/chewy interior = unique selling proposition, I recommend baking only what you can eat Day #1 & refrigerating/freezing remaining dough for future use. I baked some chilled 24 hrs. & some chilled 48 hrs. w/o clear difference in texture/flavor. Saltiness fine w/ Diamond Crystal kosher & Maldon.","1545595170","11"
"31448855","Patti","Love these cookies but had difficulty with scooping the dough after the 24 hour refrigeration. I came up with another method that doesn't change the results but is so much easier. After mixing ingredients scoop the cookies immediately onto parchment covered cookie sheets, pressing into round discs - refrigerate for 3-24 hours before baking. There is no change in flavor or texture and the cookies have a much better shape. I also see no difference if refrigerated 3 or 24 hours.","1554769246","11"
"102928487","MaggieB","These are the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever made - ever. I do one additional step to help the center of the cookie get and stay chewy.  When I remove the cookies from the oven I give the cookie sheet a rap on the counter to help deflate any ‘rise’ from baking. Then let the cookies cool on the sheets until set. I use that same technique on my oatmeal cookies, or any other cookie that I want to be chewy. It’s quick and effective.","1570282527","11"

Additionally, subbing flax eggs and vegan butter ended up being very good -- the flax taste is imperceptible in the recipe. (Omnivores ate all my cookies.)

Also, instead of refrigerating the dough and scooping it cold, roll it out into balls while it’s warm, stick them in the freezer for however long you want, and have cookies whenever—not just 1-3 days after making the dough.","1562800638","5"

The chocolate disk makes the cookie.","1578961693","5"

I halfed the recipe because there are only 2 of us in household. We do not need that many cookies. It still made 36 cookies. I rolled them slightly smaller than golf ball size.

Great recipe if you are patient and willing to wait the full 36 hours.","1650889816","5"
"118264297","a reader","I learned a trick from Cooks Illustrsted that I have used for several recipes, including CC cookies. Use cold butter. Place about 2/3 of butter in a skillet, melt and then lightly brown the butter. Pour browned butter over cold butter in mixing bowl and mix until cold butter is melted. Mix in sugars (1/2 Lt brown and 1/2 Dk brown), salt, eggs and vanilla. Mix thoroughly, then allow to sit for 3 minutes. Mix 30 seconds, then repeat twice. Then continue with recipe. Sugars develop beautifully! 597","1652220397","5"

Get cozy on the couch, get a good movie already to go and then take that cookie off it's beautiful special  plate and enjoy, truly enjoy.  Then wait for the second one the next night!

It gave me confidence, especially around the flours. 8.5 oz of cake flour is indeed more in volume than the same weight of bread flour.

It also causes fats to bind more readily to the starch granule surface, which many help disperse the fat phase more evenly.” On Food and Cooking, by Harold McGee, 2004 revised edition","1698185773","3"

I roll my batter in logs about an inch and a half to two inches thick. Wrap in saran wrap and store in fridge. When time to cook, simply cut logs into one inch disks and cook. So easy. I have found that I like the batter better after at least a week in fridge. I have gone up to a month and all points in between. I feel it allows for a creamier cookie.","1701453015","2"
