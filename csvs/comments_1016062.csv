"16865220","SCA","This is daal, minus a few essential seasonings.<br/><br/>Best made by sautéing the onions, then adding ginger and garlic paste to taste; sautéing fresh chopped tomatoes (no paste); adding spices (turmeric, coriander powder, chili powder, a touch of cinnamon if you like) once the oil has taken on the red color from the tomatoes and the vegetables have a glazed appearance.<br/><br/>Not enough salt in this recipe.  <br/><br/>Make a simple chutney with yogurt, green chilies and cilantro.","1509378895","1751"
"17062143","Jackie","Was looking forward to this making this, and after seeing the comments, made a few changes...used chicken stock, and, instead of water, one 14oz. can of diced tomatoes and more stock. I used 3 carrots instead of 1, and didn't bother to blend....and added a bag of spinach, finished with grated parm, and it was fabulous.","1509378170","1638"
"16889061","Michael","This is a very tasty recipe but I have two suggestions:<br/>1. There is too much liquid for the amount of lentils; therefore add one or two small potatoes, diced, to give the soup more body.<br/>2. Step 4 - No need for more mess of moving half the soup into another pot; get the same rougher consistency by pureeing in one pot but in short bursts until somewhat, but not entirely smooth.","1509378176","947"
"14309009","LL","This recipe makes 4 small bowls of soup. Double the recipe to serve 4-6","1509367493","708"
"17180922","SBDeb","Absolutely delicious! I will never buy lentil soup again. This soup is better than any I've had at any Persian, Arabic or other mediterranian restaurant.<br/>I did add an extra 2 cloves of garlic, extra 1/4 c of lentils, an extra carrot, and used 1/4 tsp chili powder, 1/4 tsp cayenne, and 1/4 tsp of kebab spices ( mostly coriander and cumin)<br/>Consistency and flavor were perfect!","1508868742","513"
"16984677","Mahvash","I followed the suggestion to use 2 carrots, 3 garlic cloves, and 5 cups of chicken broth, 1.5 cup red lentil and no water.  I grated my carrots and sauteed it with the garlic and onion.  I normally don't like red lentils, but this was fantastic. The lemon really rounded the soup. Will make this again.","1509378106","496"
"16871080","SCA","Jules:  for this quantity (1 cup lentils), a couple of plum tomatoes should do.  Important to get nice juicy ripe tomatoes, and to sauté all the vegetables until the oil rises to the top and takes on the red tomato color, otherwise it will retain a somewhat raw taste no matter how long you simmer the soup.  That first step ensures the full release of flavor of the spices.","1509378262","419"
"17104418","Jean","I ate this soup almost every day in Turkey, where sumac and/or mint are added at the end. Sumac is not hard to find in the US (Whole Foods carries it), and adds a lovely tartness more mellow than lemon. The mint is also a nice touch.","1508868191","413"
"16908995","Randy","You'll get more color out of the carrot and the tomato paste than the lentils. Red lentils fade rapidly to pale pink and then yellow as they are exposed to prolonged heat. But forget their color, it's the flavor and texture that makes them so desirable. If you want more red bump up the tomato or add some sweet smoked Spanish paprika--the subtle smoke note is terrific with lentils of all hues.","1509378364","330"
"16059500","MJ","We like to zest the lemon as well.  The brightness of flavor this adds is incredible.  The flavor just explodes in your mouth!","1509374845","314"
"17242954","Gary","I make this all the time. At the end I often add fish (a pound of tilapia works nicely) to make a rich one-pot dinner - like a thick chowder. (The fish cooks in the hot soup.) I like things spicy so I then adjust the seasonings (including the amount of lemon) accordingly; and I let the volume reduce a bit by not covering the pot tightly when simmering.","1508867434","304"
"16879637","Isabel","Just made this for the first time, and it was delicious. I understand that some people do not like cilantro, but it really does benefit from that flavour, as well as the lemon juice. Keep those two ingredients in there, and you won't be sorry! I followed the recipe exactly, and didn't find it too thin. I have leftovers, and keep going back to the pot for another spoonful. I will say that it gets thicker as it cools. Highly recommend, and will definitely make again.","1509379226","236"
"16933021","Zoe","After I used the immersion blender, I added a bunch of lacinato kale torn into small pieces and cooked for a few more minutes until wilted. Delicious!","1509378764","222"
"14912778","Katy","I have made this soup at least 3 dozen times, always yielding the same delicious results. It freezes beautifully making it a great option for make-ahead menu item or impromtu dinner party. In addition to the cilantro, I like to garnish with toasted pepitas. It's so good I've served it as light lunch item on Thanksgiving.","1509369081","204"
"14322464","Carey Larsen","This is such an easy, healthy, inexpensive soup. I add two tablespoons of barley to give it a little silkiness. Also use ground chipotle pepper. I cook this in my pressure cooker for about 9 minutes, which results in no need for the immersion blender step.","1509366661","183"
"17054047","Val","This is a wonderful soup with the following amendments: double the spicing, use three carrots instead of one, and use an entire small can of tomato paste. Salt to taste. I also add a dollop of plain yogurt on top at the end when served with the cilantro.","1509379228","109"
"16522575","Anita","This soup is wonderfully delicious.  For a variation I add 1 teaspoon of curry powder to the spices and then serve the soup with a dollop of yogurt.  I also saute the carrots with the onion and garlic to bring out more sweetness.  Yummm!","1509375438","101"
"17133431","Sally","After reading all the comments, I used sumac & mint at the end, to make it more like the Turkish version.  Served it with crustini with tomato/basil/buffalo mozzarella, to bring in another Mediterranean flavor.  Fabulous and fun weeknight dinner!","1508868010","86"
"17172990","Nancy","Delicious. But I followed the advice of others here and added a lot more spices: 1 extra TBS of tomato paste, 1 tsp smoked paprika, 1tsp smoked coriander, an additional tsp of salt. Also let it simmer an extra 10 minutes which thickened it up a bit.","1508867359","79"
"30348469","H","I add smoked paprika to this recipe - a wonderful addition to a wonderful dish.","1548554564","75"
"17091484","Elle","No, coriander and cumin are not the same. You may be thinking of cilantro and coriander. Coriander is the seed of the leafy green herb. Cumin is something else altogether.","1508868744","70"
"30260201","Barbara","This soup is tasty but I only put half of the water in as it is really too thin.  I added chickpeas for some bulk.  Wondering if the recipe meant to use two rather than one cup of lentils.  ","1548094130","67"
"30359124","Roberto","I buy those pre roasted grocery store chickens for a few dollars. First night I pick all the meat off the bones and eat the dark meat. The rest of the meat goes in the fridge. The bones, juice at the bottom of the container, fat, any skin I don't eat right away goes into the pressure cooker for a good long blast. The stock goes into the fridge. Next day I make Melissa's red lentil soup using the reserved stock. The chicken meat can be added to the lentils after they are done. Vegans beware.","1548652309","67"
"17107866","JayNYC","Wow, delicious. Of course made some changes, some taken from the Cooks Illustrated version I just saw in my email. Used both cumin and coriander - both toasted and ground fresh. The coriander has some natural lemon essence. Added a pinch of cinnamon and also a squirt of harissa (and went easy on the chile powder). I also sautéed the carrots with the onion, but that was only because I goofed. Only change for next time - less liquid as others have also suggested. Maybe a bit more tomato paste too.","1508867593","63"
"17139661","Mal","This was amazing! My family absolutely loved it too. I doubled the recipe for 4 eaters and had a nice lunch left over. I also added 2 stalks of celery, 1 russet potato and about 1/3 cup of tomato sauce. I put lemon zest in before simmering and then added the lemon juice about 5 minutes before serving. Delicious!","1508868579","61"
"30358793","Debra","I make this soup in the Instant Pot and set it for pressure cook for 12 minutes. I also add 1/2 cup more lentils and add another 1/2 teaspoon of cumin to the recipe. ","1548647829","60"
"16935896","James Ferrell","This is one of my favorite soups.  I think it is even better with toasted cumin seed (dry roasted in a small frying pan until the seeds begin to pop) in place of the ground cumin, but it's good either way.","1509378767","58"
"17172334","Deb","Thanks to all of you who sent comments.  I'm taking them into account.  <br/><br/>Melissa--given all the trend in the comments-too watery, etc. --is this a recipe that would benefit from revision and reissue,  or do you like the watery quality of the soup?<br/><br/>-Deb","1508867440","54"
"16796268","Juliet Jones","When salt is added to a dish such as this one, can you really distinguish different types of salt? I can't.","1509377195","52"
"16253992","Davida","Super easy, yummy soup. Great for weeknight or make ahead meals. Was a big hit served w a dollop of Greek yogurt and fresh parsley (instead of cilantro). <br/><br/>Used Aleppo pepper instead of cayenne/chili and blended right in the pot using an immersion blender (no need to remove half and dirty another dish) but otherwise followed recipe. Will definitely make again. Doesn't make a lot (3 main course servings) so would double next time and maybe add an extra carrot or two.","1509375453","50"
"17540464","AGA","We love this soup. Have made it four times now. A few things I do differently that I think improve the flavor are:<br/><br/>1. I use crushed tomatoes instead of tomato paste<br/>2. I use cumin seed in addition to ground cumin, tsp. or so of each. The seed adds a depth of flavor.<br/>3. I don't purée because the lentils fall apart as it is, why dirty more utensils?<br/>4. I use rainbow carrots & 1.5x the amount in the recipe.<br/>5. I top the bowl of soup with chopped fresh cilantro and yoghurt.","1508870710","41"
"30345133","Sri","So I just watched Milk Street Kitchen's lentil soup. I love Melissa's recipe. But I have to say the finishing touch on the MSK's recipe would be fabulous on this. Heat 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil and toast 1 Tbsp Aleppo pepper (or use a combo of smoked paprika and chilli flakes). Let the pepper steep into the oil. Drizzle on the soup. It's a 'tarka' style topping that takes this soup over the top. ","1548521589","41"
"30377353","Errol","A billion Indians eat this at every meal.  Its called ""dal"" or pronounced daahl.  Its the vegetarians' main source of protein.  Utterly delish.  So glad its coming to everyday American tables.","1548765528","41"
"30359129","miriam","- 3 more cloves of garlic - 1.5 cups of red lentils - 1 teaspoon of grated ginger (would add more next time) - Zest of one small lemon - Juice of two small lemons + served with lemon wedges. - More salt, pepper and cayenne - Used just one quart of chicken stock...no extra water. - Used an immersion blender","1548652419","33"
"30173948","Tracie","Usually stick to original recipe. Only difference, I added celery and carrot to the sauté, extra chile powder, and blended the ENTIRE pot with my hand held  $20 immersion cuisinart blender (can't live without).The soup became instantly more flavorful after blending. Loved the consistency of it not being too thick (nice change) and since there are 5 of us to feed I doubled the recipe and made a huge salad to go with.  So good I inhaled two cups before the rest of my tribe got home:) Party!!!","1547591252","32"
"30249949","Sarosh S","I dust it with sumac, and on top of that add a tablespoon of sumac when adding cumin. Ooh lala","1547998676","32"
"30347791","Dagmar Degree ","Ok , ate 2 bowls of this soup. I was swooning.  Such simple ingredients and relatively short prep and cooking time. It tastes as if some chic chef made it instead of moi! I love lots of your recipes, Melissa, but you've outdone yourself with this one. And it's vegan, for all our veganistas. I used veg stock. Well I cheated a bit, water with 'better than boullion', always on hand. Will make this for my son who loves my go to lentil soup, which is very good, but this is awesome. Thank you!","1548548519","32"
"30331931","Pam","Can use1 can chopped or crushed tomatoes instead of tomato paste, or whole can of tomato paste","1548442800","31"
"30358118","Lisa","Actually, this is a soup I’ve often found in Turkish restaurants. (I think the traditional soup might have sumac in it, which has a lemony flavor, but I’m not sure.) The order in which the ingredients are added in this recipe isn’t consistent with Indian cuisine, and broth isn’t a typical Indian ingredient.","1548640172","30"
"17042262","Wendy","Based upon the other comments, I only used broth and skipped the water.  Soup came out excellent!","1509378119","27"
"30154331","robyn b.","I tend to follow recipes exactly, instead of trusting my instincts.  This soup was super watery and as I was pouring in the 2 cups of water, I had a bad feeling.  Yes, the soup was full of flavor, but if I make it again, I will not add all of the water and I will add more tomato paste and possibly a sweet potato or some other vegetable.  ","1547506945","27"
"30260043","Robin","Made this as the tundra like temperatures descended near Boston. Light, spicy and bold as promised. Love the color. Doubled ingredients (quadrupled spices after reading notes here) to make more servings. Didn't quite have enough tomato paste on hand so added two tablespoons of adobo sauce from can of chipotles in adobo sauce. I roasted my carrots first and added those sautéed chicken sausage, after blending all with immersion blender and let simmer a bit more to release their flavors. A keeper!","1548093105","27"
"24448012","Jasmine","Instant Pot version: Sautéed two med onions, 5 minced garlic cloves, and spices and tomato paste in pot, added two large carrots, two celery ribs, homemade vegetable stock + water (as per recipe), and pressured cooked on high for 10 minutes.   Then stirred in one bunch of ribboned lacinato kale, replaced lemon with 1.5 tsp of sumac, added heaping 1/2 tsp of yellow miso (instead of more salt), covered lid while pot was still hot to allow kale to wilt down a bit. Served with fresh mint. Delicious!","1507952955","26"
"30378026","Nadine","This is very Turkish, especially if you leave out the cilantro and give people sumac to sprinkle on top.  My mother-in-law would put in a handful of rice along with the lentils.  It binds the soup and makes it silky.  Not too much, or it gets a bit gummy.  For 7 C. water (no broth), I use about 1/4 C. of rice, and 1 1/2 C. red lentils.  I haven't tried garlic, but that sounds good.  I usually add a small stalk of celery, chopped, which maybe isn't authentically Turkish, but gives it more umami.","1548767881","24"
"16796393","M.Lussini","This is a lentil soup if you add too many flavors you are missing the whole idea. I usually wait until the last 12 minutes to apply the Cumin as it tends to give a slight bitter taste if you cook it longer. Cilantro is very powerful when cooked I don't use it I like to taste the lentils. Finally try using  about 15% of a cup to a cup lentils ratio of Egyptian Rice if you don't like to add carrots.","1509377563","23"
"30348588","Dennis II","Great flavors!  Added about a quarter tsp of chipotle chili powder rather than ""a pinch"" and that zipped it up a bit.  Maybe a tad more salt would be good.  But we loved the result - will do this one again soon.  Perfect for a cold January evening in frozen Michigan. ","1548555680","23"
"30377405","Errol","PS. must add turmeric powder.  Its the champion deodorizer of flesh - fish, meat, chicken as well as foul smelling veg like cabbage cauliflower etc.","1548765700","23"
"16879564","Cristina","Simple and good. However the lemon and cilantro are a must as they bring the favors together. I had no fresh cilantro but reached for my frozen cilantro cubes. You can buy herbs in little cubes in the frozen section of your (high end) supermarket- they come in so handy, especially in winter! I also added a pkg of frozen cauliflower pieces, which gave it a tad more hardiness without changing the favors. Great for a chilly day.","1509378159","22"
"30253929","Feltchy","So I added half a teaspoon of coriander and a pinch of both cardamom and tumeric for the fuller curry effect. Had half an apple laying around so I diced that up  and threw it in as well. With the addition of the lemon juice and cilantro it turned out  to be really complex and wonderful! Spicy, a little sweet and a little sour. Love this and will continue to make it for family and friends!","1548022002","22"
"17249350","Jan Priddy","I have made a similar recipe for years. Sometimes I use more carrots and also yams or red potatoes; sometimes I use a can of coconut milk, 2 tablespoons of currants, and a healthy dose of curry powder; sometimes I serve over rice.","1508867377","21"
"26209946","Mrs B","Actually this is a Turkish style soup called Mercemek. Not to take away from my own South Asian heritage, but this is not dahl. It is a simple and very elegant soup that doesn't need to be muddled with more spices. The lemon and herbs (dill or mint also work) make it tasty just fine. If you want to add another element, some extra virgin olive oil over the top won't hurt. I am all for changing things up but the simplicity of this soup should not be mistaken for lacking anything.","1520267415","21"
"29973803","Courtney","I always seem to prefer lentil soup with WAY more lentils than recipes call for, so I went ahead and added the full pound. (That's 2 cups and a little more.) I left everything else the same except that I added a little chopped candied ginger with the garlic, a pinch of turmeric, and a can of full-fat coconut milk when I pureed 1/2 of it. The finished soup was creamy and silky with just enough texture from the un-pureed veggies, and the color was gorgeous. Definitely putting this one in my rotati","1546480444","21"
"30025942","Suzanne","Very good but needed some tweaking.  Added the following:  - 3 more cloves of garlic - 1.5 cups of red lentils - 1 teaspoon of grated ginger (would add more next time) - Zest of one small lemon - Juice of two small lemons + served with lemon wedges. - More salt, pepper and cayenne - Used just one quart of chicken stock...no extra water. - Used an immersion blender  Next time I will most likely serve with a dollop of yogurt or sour cream.

"30135896","trowe2","Delicious! Cooked lentils 6 minutes in the instant pot with a 10 minute natural release. Added a bit of sumac at the end. Sprinkled with Za’atar and olive oil for serving ","1547405074","19"
"30245707","CB","I LOVE this recipe - make it probably twice a month at least. That said, I make modifications: Triple the carrot, cumin and chili powder. Add some cinnamon and nutmeg, and a few small potatoes along with carrot that blend in really nicely at the end. I think it's too liquidy as written, so I either just do broth, or use a can of cream of chicken soup mixed with water to suffice for liquid. I also just found myself without tomato paste, so substituted with a bit of sriracha sauce. Yum!","1547960221","19"
"30321012","Wendy","This is amazing! I double or triple the garlic, and add more hot pepper - just depends how spicy you like your food. We crumble good tortilla chips on top, along with the cilantro, yogurt and lemon. Delish!","1548383917","19"
"30357488","Roberta Barr","Melissa, I think you need to start referencing the inspiration for ""your"" recipes.  This is Indian Dal.  If you cite your inspiration for recipes, you'll get less credit, but it would be more honest.   ","1548632470","19"
"30377232","Wendy","I add 1/2 cup of bulgur at the same time as the lentils.  It gives the soup a nice body.  Also substitute a 15 1/2 oz can of diced tomatoes for the tomato paste.","1548764941","19"
"16864572","Lisa","This is similar to my favourite recipe from a vegetarian cafe in Victoria, Canada called ReBar.   Their's is spiced with oregano and rosemary, with crumbled feta overtop. It's incredibly fast, easy, and delicious!    The whole ReBar cookbook is awesome, it's made my goal to eat more veg and less meat much easier!","1509379250","18"

"30369493","Molliela","Really wishing I'd read through the comments before making this. Following the recipe exactly made a thin, watery, and unappetizingly yellow gruel. Added another 1/2 cup of lentils and cooked for another 15 minutes to give it an edible consistency. Next time, I'll add more fresh tomato and carrots, maybe some fennel. The lemon and cilantro are what makes this soup notable.","1548710675","18"
"30380083","Dave ","I first had this soup in Damascus in the early 1980’s and have loved it and made it at home ever since. Most restaurants in the middle-east serve with pita bread fried croutons which are delicious but, well, fried. So my variation is to cut up thin pita piece in postage stamp size, toss in a bit of olive oil and oven bake until a deep rich brown color and lightly salt if desired. Garnish the soup and keep a bowl in the middle of the table for eveyone to replenish the soup topping.","1548773698","18"
"30396345","BKB","This really is the best lentil soup ever. Even my husband, not a big lentil fan, loves this soup. I took the advice of another commenter and added a bit more water and tomato paste and a quarter cup of basmati rice, which gave it more body and a silkier texture. This is the perfect comfort food for the polar vortex.","1548859954","18"
"30369997","Steve","I haven't made this recipe yet, but I have cooked with red lentils a lot. My initial take on reading the recipe is that I would add turmeric, probably a teaspoon or more. I'd do that at the same time as the other spices, and I would probably increase the other spices as well. (Measurements? I don't need no steenking measurements!) While I'm at it, I would probably use lime rather than lemon.","1548712787","17"
"30392453","John Luker","My wife said, ""I've had many good lentil soups, but this is the best, by far."" I agree. I went a little heavier with the cumin and chili powder--a heaping teaspoon of each. I used about 3/4 tsp salt. I also used the juice from a whole lemon, albeit a small lemon. We tend toward bolder seasonings, so this may not be to everyone's taste, but for us it was perfection.","1548819904","17"

"30011265","Colleen","Unconventional for New York Times Cooking, I am sure, but I received an Instapot and decided to use my go to recipes in it. Using saute function, I add onion and garlic. I follow the recipe as is, with the exception of a bit more cumin and cayenne. Once the lentils, broth and water have been added, the pot is sealed and set to high pressure for 10 minutes. Once allowed to depressurize, open and stir vigorously. This thickens soup and melds ingredients without immersion blender. Flavorful.","1546708483","16"

The bit of pork made a huge difference.  I could see using bacon in place of ham for an equally delicious option.  Very few soups that are so easy to get right.

Red lentils fall apart if you cook them long enough.  Simmering an extra 10 mins or so does the trick.  Absolutey do not skip the lemon juice and the end.  It's esential.","1522112637","5"

Furthermore, we also add 1/2 tbs of paprika powder together with the other spices. Lastly, we use up to 7-10 tbs of blended whole tomatoes from a can (blend it yourself, it makes a difference).

A couple of notes, though: Not nearly enough cumin in the recipe - I always add at least a tablespoon. I also sometimes add slightly more than a cup of lentils. It can be too watery otherwise. Lastly, I only puree just a tad more than 1/4 of the soup. We like the chunky lentils, but a little puree does help to thicken. The lemon is the key!","1508871994","3"

I did not dress it up with other Indian seasonings, I did not puree any of it but the texture was perfect. And I didn't send anyone out for cilantro. The soup was subtle and delicious without.

I use vegetable stock and do not use cilantro - I’m just not one who loves it. I garnish the soup with chopped fresh tomatoes and strained yogurt. I serve it with crusty sourdough bread or cornbread depending on whether I want something sweet to counter the spices.

But I agree with other comments that it needs substantially more chile pepper, spices, including ginger, and garlic as well as lemon all of which I added and liked.  I'm not sure that adding the additional lentils is called for - this is soup not porridge.  If you like a thick soup to support a stand-up spoon, go ahead and add the additional half cup of lentils.

It was actually soup then, with a lovely texture. With less water, it was much more like dal, and also delicious. To the thicker version of the soup, I added a bag of chopped frozen kale (thawed and squeezed dry) and another half a lemon. You could play with those spices a lot. That was also delicious, but really a different dish.","1548731145","3"

I was hoping for a lot more flavor. Next time I'll swap out the veggie stock (too sweet and mild) for a bolder chicken stock, I'll double the cumin and pepper, and I'll add a measurable amount of chili powder or cayenne (or chipotle or smoked paprika).

I read a lot of the comments and decided that I'd try it ""as written"" the first time. I am glad I did because I think it is perfect and delicious. It thickened up just fine. And, with all due respect to the folks adding other kinds of tomatoes, I believe the tomato paste is there to add umami and not to make this a lentil tomato soup.","1701135153","3"

So I caved and made it. One word - ""unremarkable"". <br/><br/>My personal recommendation sub out the cumin/chili powder for  2-3 t. curry powder. After the lentils have simmered, add a can of coconut milk and the tomato paste- 3T. Heat through, add 1 T. butter (opt) and some chopped cilantro. Serve over rice. Oh yeah!","1509376825","2"

I served it with hot corn bread and an arugula salad.<br/><br/>I followed the recipe as presented.

"16937820","Sherry S","Excellent. Based on several comments I used 1 1/2 cups of lentils and 5 cups of chicken broth, no water - I wanted a thicker soup. Used at least a full lemon, more chili, salt and pepper (added extra at end). Reserved about 2 cups and puréed the rest with an immersion blender. First time working with red lentils and I was pleased with the end result. (Do not judge soup until it is fully ready to serve - do not omit the lemon!)","1509379183","2"

"16939579","John","Yes! I also love whole pan-toasted cumin seed in some recipes added at the end, and you don't even have to crush it, just leave it whole, and its super crispy and gives those little bursts of cumin when you bite into them.","1509379077","2"
"16942317","Tom","Like so many others, we really loved this. Cheap, nutritious, and very tasty. I used 1.5 times as many lentils as called for, and it seemed perfect. Since it was dinner, like some others are doing I added a medium potato (yukon) diced the same size as the carrot (about 1/4""); very nice. Ladled out about 1/2, blended remainder with immersion blender, added the other half back with the lemon and cilantro, along with more salt. So simple, and so delicious.","1509378460","2"
"16943079","mem_somerville","This was very tasty, with a nice color and texture. It also reheated well, which is important to me when making a pot of soup. It didn't separate or over-thicken. I also paired it with a crusty baguette and it was perfectly filling.","1509378641","2"
"16944326","Kim D.","I agree with the comment that there is too much liquid for the quantity of lentils, so next time I make it (and I will again, soon) will increase the lentils to about 1.5 cups.  Overall, an easy, delicious soup with lovely flavors and texture.","1509378615","2"

"17101404","Kathy Millard","I don't like to add oil to soup  at the end of cooking like this suggests: it always seems like trying to make-up for not getting the flavours right. Be sure your stock is hearty, if it is on the weak side, the soup will be tasteless. Water too, would weaken it.  Otherwise, it is a nice soup served with a dollop of thick Greek yogurt or sour cream. ( I doubled the spices after I read the comments.)","1508868963","2"

"17205708","Maggie","I adore this soup.  I add potatoes and a couple of chopped tomatoes, and substitute vegetable broth for the 2 cups of water, and the consistency is perfect...not too watery at all.   I triple the garlic, and use lots of chipotle chili powder.  I also puree half the soup right in the pot with an immersion blender.  Once I used regular lentils, and it wasn't as tasty.","1508868498","2"
"17212756","Kathleen","Definitely agree with the comments below re: using less water. I personally used the quart of broth per above, and instead of the recommended (2) cups of water, I added (1).<br/><br/>I also doubled the paste/salt/pepper/cumin/chile powder and added an extra minced garlic clove. <br/><br/>Lemon and cilantro add some really good flavor.

"30419578","Melu","Made this on a whim but didn't have red lentils so I used white beans (minimum 2 cans). Also did not have cilantro so left that out. Turned out deliciously, so much so that I made this again the next night. One word of caution: The recipe calls for olive oil on high heat to saute the onions in. But it is much safer to instead use an oil suited for frying, because olive oil releases harmful substances when heated on high. Other than that: Loved the recipe! ","1548968467","2"

I had to add Lots of salt and lemon juice to get it to a place where I felt OK serving it. Maybe it's the red lentils...I have had many tastier lentil soups using green lentils.

I think the recipe would be quite bland as given.  I doubled most of the spices as several noted; also added ground coriander, baharat powder, & smoked paprika. Even then it was a bit bland the first night.  The second two nights we heated it with sliced spicy mango chicken sausage, & stirred in a dollop of plain yogurt per serving.  Yummy.

My only critical comment is that the measurements for spices, salt, and pepper, in my opinion, left the soup bland.  To be fair I like a LOT of flavor in my recipes.  I doubled the salt, black pepper and chili pepper measurements.  Result was that one of my sons thought the extra cayenne was too much, one felt not enough.  Just right for me. The squeeze of lemon at the end is Essential","1549828888","2"

I added twice the garlic, twice the lemon juice, and when it was cold I dumped out almost all the liquid that had accumulated on the top. Only then was it substantial and flavorful.

The consistency was perfect; not thin at all but the consistency of pea soup with delicious carrots to add crunch.  The seasoning was just right.  I served it with garlic bread to dip.  I'm going to make it again for a gathering on Friday!","1550002909","2"

I had only 2 cups of homemade broth; had to use boxed for the rest. Still great. Used cayenne, a bit more cumin, and a bit more salt. Based on others' comments, at first I added no extra water. It became apparent early on that the soup would be way too thick, so I did add one cup and it was perfect.  Glad I didn't dink around with the recipe; wonderful as is.","1551980174","2"

"31126815","June","Made this a second time. Great once again. Used no water -- the only time I've added water is after leftovers have sat in a container and gotten thick as lentils absorb moisture.  Used 1.5 to 2x the spices and added sambal chile paste to taste. Second time I cooked cilantro into the soup which was nice. As with most things, I double the garlic... or more.","1553014418","2"

"105122858","Liz","This recipe is perfect the way it is written. As I have a vegetarian daughter, we use a chicken flavored vegetarian ""Better than Bouillon"" as the broth base and it is fabulous. If your lemon is large, use a bit less. The lemon is a real brightener of the soup. We made homemade bread to go with it and even my extremely picky (""why would I eat a lentil"") husband loved it. I'm sure all of the variations suggested are grand, but start with the original and you'll be thrilled.","1581300359","2"
"105867026","Delicous Soup With Some Modifications","Delicious soup made following several of the raters' suggestions; I used Roma tomatoes with the garlic and onion instead of tomato paste. I used 3 carrots and 2 small potatoes. I used the immersion blender to make a nice thick consistency. I put the soup back on the heat and added some chopped fresh greens ( I happened to have kale and dandelion on hand) and cooked until they were wilted. Then I added the cilantro and fresh squeezed lemon just as I served it. Delicious then and as leftovers.","1584461593","2"
"106001050","Anne","Sam Sifton wrote this morning:""the idea that you have to follow an ingredients list closely to do so is bunk."" Armed thusly I made this soup for our dinner, subbing as needed because a patriot doesn't run out to the store for the ""nice to haves"". A smoky thick salsa subbed for the tomato paste, and ordinary lentils for the red lentils. I doubled the lemon, increased the chile powder, and added a few stalks of finely chopped celery. It was lovely, with a dollop of sour cream and garlic bread.","1585008415","2"

I added extra unsalted organic culinary chicken stock to replace the water for a deeper flavor, an additional 1/2 cup of red lentils for a thicker soup, and a dash or two of smoked paprika. No need to separate the soup for blending, in my opinion. Just stick your immersion blender in the pan for about 30 seconds or so. Excellent, and a lovely version of dahl without the curry flavor. A keeper!","1643999307","2"

I was completely satisfied with the flavor; a type of contentment settled in after the meal, what is a kind of rarified experience. I followed the advice of another user and replaced the water with a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes, added some water as needed while cooking. Also added 5-cups of spinach near the end. Used an immersion blender for about 1 minute.  I think it's hard to mess this recipe up.","1644331398","2"

If you really want to blend it but don’t have any kind of blender (like me the first two times I made it) a hand mixer will do the trick, but the texture when it’s not blended is also perfectly nice. I make it as is—add lots of lemon! It makes four servings and I find it filling. My partner and I always have leftovers for the next day.","1644630518","2"
