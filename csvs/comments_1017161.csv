"16209112","Sam Sifton","Trim eggplant and cut it into long slices. Salt the slices and let them sit for 20 minutes or so, then pat them dry. Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towel and place a wire rack on top. In a large, deep skillet, heat 1/2 cup oil until a drop of water flicked into pan sizzles. Working in batches, fry eggplant until just tender, 20 to 30 seconds per side. Transfer fried eggplant to rack to drain. Nice with shawarma!","1509374157","971"
"16070774","Christine Staples","I've lost track of how many times I've made this amazing dish since I first cut it out; there's some in the fridge right now. I have made the following additions: more onion - it's so good. More chicken - it goes so fast: 3 pounds. Two pounds of carrots, which I toss in the marinade and roast with the extra red onion. An astonishing recipe!","1509374362","831"
"14038211","Linda E.","I used chicken breasts to cut some of the fat here and reduced cook time to about 20 minutes so the chicken wouldn't dry out. It was delicious, juicy and light! ","1509365537","586"
"18723428","Danielle","One of my favorites!!!  Sometimes I buy extra chicken thigh packages and freeze the raw chicken thighs in the marinade 1 pound at a time.  This way during a busy weeknight, I have an easy homemade recipe ready to go.  I usually thaw it out first thing in the morning or even overnight.  Works great!","1508877742","573"
"17072839","Andybhoy","2 1/2 tablespoons of oil is enough - 1/2 cup is way too much !","1509378133","426"
"16298796","LiveToFish","All dry ingredients have been combined and stored with a label ""Shawarma Mix"". Awesome.","1509376092","415"
"17480244","cookies or cake","I second the suggestion to double the onion.  If you have tasty lemons (like Meyer) cut them into eighths and roast along with the chicken -- exceptional!","1508870871","397"
"16983849","Alexandra Lightning","This is a superb  and easy supper. Marinated boneless thighs about 8 hours in fridge and cooked exactly according to recipe with the additional pan frying. Added a Greek salad made with seeded, English cucumber, mini San Marzano tomatoes (Trader Joe's), Kalamata olives, Greek feta, sherry vinegar and olive oil. No pita needed. Also made a yogurt sauce using 2% Fage (the best!) with lemon zest & juice,  a couple cloves of garlic put through a press, and salt and pepper. Marvelous!","1509378127","332"
"17255092","Pam","Very easy, absolutely delicious. Combined the following to make a tahini sauce: 1 c plain yogurt, 2 T tahini, 1 T lemon juice. 1/2 t. salt.","1508867594","236"
"15848007","Michelle","Excellent for a party...I used 10 lbs of trimmed boneless chicken thighs, reducing the oil, and cutting onions into 8ths. Meat sliced nicely after the 10 minute post-cooking rest.  Marinated for 24 hours, cooked the chicken in the marinade, & the meat held up fine. I used a lipped cookie sheet, to avoid spills in my oven.  Everyone asked for  leftovers to take home.  Wonderful flavor, and easy to prepare.  I served it with marinated feta, pita, couscous,  moroccan carrot salad, etc.","1509372829","231"
"17609082","ruthblue","A flawless dish, and yet a couple of tips: no need to use a dish for the marinade. I put everything into a large ziplock, massaged the ingredients to blend, and then added the chicken. No mess and easy to store while the birds marinates. I also used chicken breasts, bone in, skin on. Unbelievably juicy and tender, and easy to cut into smaller pieces after roasting.","1508869301","220"
"17044983","TK","Agree with most everyone here - there's a reason this is a favorite! Followed the recipe to a ""t"" and everything came out perfectly - and served on Christmas Eve. Even the little ones (4 and 5) loved it! Two days later I'm out for more chicken thighs to make another batch. Served with chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, lettuce and a Tzatziki, Hummus, Sweet Chili sauce (all from Trader Joe's) and the NYT Rice Pilaf with Pistachios and Almonds. Delicious!!! Loved it!","1509378167","193"
"14085578","Nicole S.","The pan crisping at the end of this recipe really made this taste like the Schwarma I used to get in Jerusalem. Brought out the flavor more. ","1509366295","178"
"16274671","MSH","Made this for dinner last night. Amazing. Used half the olive oil and the juice of one lemon, but kept the other herbs/spices the same. Served with white sauce (1/4 cup mayo, 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt, juice of half a lemon, 1 clove garlic, minced), chickpea salad, and toasted (in a skillet) pita bread. Yum, yum, yum. Watch the chicken carefully the last 20 minutes. Even though I turned the heat down, it would have over-cooked if I'd left it in the oven for the full 40 minutes.","1509376174","160"
"17662703","Susan Lopez","I've made this countless times from the recipe by Nigella Lawson.<br/><br/>I would recommend the thighs bone in with skin for roasting. I use a very hot oven at the start for 10 min and then reduce the temp. This renders the fat in the same way as a spit and keeps it moist. I'm always amazed how much fat renders this way.<br/><br/>Afterwards remove the skin-if you must-and then the bones.<br/><br/>Also recommend you find a good yeast, flour, oil based dough recipe for flat bread. Makes the dish extra special.","1508869920","108"
"16566349","HAT","Have now made this twice - once with boneless skinless chicken thighs & once with chicken legs. The thighs I baked for 20 mins, then put under broiler for 3 mins. The legs I baked for 30 mins, then put under broiler for 4 mins. I used 2 onions (thinly sliced) & I added a potato (cut up) to the seasoning & put it beside the chicken to bake for a heartier meal without needing rice. This is an amazing chicken dish. 5 stars all the way.","1509377548","87"
"18481519","Laurie Mann","This is also a great way to use up roast chicken leftovers.  Make the marinade and put in shredded cooked chicken.  Marinate for a few hours, toss in some chopped onions and fry for about 10 minutes until the onions are soft.","1508875327","77"
"16805020","BAJZ","Sam, you've done it again. This is wonderful. Right up there with your Roasted Chicken Provençal.  We normally like chicken with skin and bone, but don't need them here.  Somehow the mix of lemon and garlic with chicken verges on  magic. I did cut the onion in smaller pieces so it would caramelize more, and I also cut the amount of chicken to 1.5 pounds.   Didn't bother to slice it, and served with broccoli salad and roasted butternut squash. Yum.","1509377471","75"
"17052477","Janine Gross","Fantastic recipe!  Chicken cooks in 25 min. plus about 3 min. under broiler to crisp.  Double the red onions and make your own yogurt sauce using Greek yogurt thinned with fresh lemon juice plus some grated garlic and a pinch of salt.   Mine looked just like the photo.  Company-worthy!","1509379001","67"
"15292012","Diane","Double onions! one recipe feeds 2, not 4-6","1509370168","50"
"14990782","Sahil","This was great! I'd recommend putting a decent amount of red pepper flakes in the marinade. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs (which worked great!) and also included some cherry tomatoes in the roasting pan (highly recommended). It was done in around 25 minutes. I served on spinach tortillas with cucumber, hummus, tahini, and feta -- great for leftovers, too! Leftover fixings also go well with baked falafel (<a href=""http://markbittman.com/recipe/baked-falafel-with-tahini-sauce/"" title=""http://markbittman.com/recipe/baked-falafel-with-tahini-sauce/"" target=""_blank"">http://markbittman.com/recipe/baked-falafel-with-tahini-sauce/</a>.","1509369285","46"
"16911610","Smokey","Olive oil does NOT become carcinogenic when heated. All oils, when heated beyond their smoke points can release vapors that contain toxins .... although those toxins are not harmful to humans. Alas, some of the health and culinary attrinbutes of olive and other oils can be lost when they are heated.","1509378333","43"
"28935171","Monique","This shawarma sauce also makes a great dip: 1/2 cup Greek yogurt (I prefer Fage) Juice from 1/2 a lime 1 tblsp tahini 3 cloves minced garlic 1 tsp dried dill (or 2 tblsp fresh) 5 chopped mint leaves 1/4 tsp salt Place all ingredients in a blender or food processor until well mixed and fluffy.","1538975436","43"
"16798400","Sha","Love this recipe. I've made it 3 times, once without marinating at all. It has been excellent all three times. I added an onion and a bell pepper last time, and finished it off by broiling for 5-10mins instead of frying. Served it with pitta bread, hummus and a tomato, cucumber and parsley salad dresses with lemon, olive oil, salt and sumac. Yummy!","1509376721","41"
"30224855","laurie","This dish is the equivalent of the little black dress! It's simple to make, can be dressed up or down, and versatile for many different types of occasions. Thankfully previous reviews gave great ideas about what to serve it with. I made a yogurt cucumber sauce and a tahini sauce, added fresh pita, olives, tomatoes and cucumbers. I had a cauliflower I needed to use up so I roasted it along with the chicken and onions, tossed in the same sauce. BEST cauliflower I've ever had...","1547837847","41"
"17107816","Judy","Followed the recipe as written except the cinnamon.<br/>Wow, great recipe.   Usually stay away from turmeric,  but this was awesome.  Don't skimp on the lemons, they add so much flavor and help tenderize the thighs.<br/>Black pepper is essential<br/>Yes, olive oil could be reduced.<br/>I drained the sheet pan covered with foil and put back in the oven under the broiler for a few minutes.<br/>I would do more red onion next time, and I served it with leek/carrot/jasmine rice<br/>A keeper.","1508868426","39"
"18336541","AMR - Scottsdale, AZ","We first did this exactly as noted, then subsequently decided to grill vs. roast.  It cut the time in half and tastes delicious.  I reserve the marinade, sauté with the onion, then pour over the finished product.  One of our top five favorite meals.  The blend of spices is perfect.","1508874040","39"
"17655790","Amy","There are not enough good things to say about this recipe. My family DEMANDS this recipe all the time and my husband eats the leftovers for breakfast because he's afraid there won't be any leftover when he comes home from work the next day. Try it once and you will know why it was one of the most downloaded recipes on the NYT site in 2015. LOVE IT!!","1508870084","37"

"30840468","Molly Rhodes","We have made this many times. I suggest cutting the chicken before marinating because it gets into every piece of the chicken and is delicious. Also, if you do this you can skip the pan fry after the baking because the chicken crisps up nicely.","1551393639","31"
"16996868","Sissi","Lifesaver for lazy bums; I make it frequently, in large quantities & freeze it. My option for instant sauce: yoghurt & TAHINI, with bit of salt.","1509378995","22"
"17047492","Merry","Forgot to mention I had no lemon juice so I used a couple of tablespoons of apple cider vinegar. I think I'll continue with that as the flavor balance was great.","1509378722","22"

"17973461","David Antonacci","My previous note aside - this was an amazing dish.  Especially for this italian boy. lol  I have eaten in many delicious hole-in-the-all Middle Eastern restaurants and, while my Syrian friend shook his head at this recipe, I thought it has many delicious qualities.  That my family didn't leave any leftovers - that said a lot.

"100206438","TK","I may have made a note before but we've cooked so many times going to share again. Made this recipe exactly as written and it comes out beautifully. Serve with pita, cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce, TJ's Creamy Tzatziki, sweet chili - persian rice...jasmine rice...oh so much or so little on the table. We love this recipe so much that for the past 3 years it's become our go-to Christmas Eve dinner recipe. Everyone rolls their own Shawarma sandwich or salad and we feast with family or friends. Enjoy!","1556336511","17"
"14843779","Lesa","I've already made this recipe four times. It's been a huge hit. The only changes I have made are small -- I thinly sliced rather than quartered the red onions (some of them crisped up in a most delicious way) and I added at least two more juiced lemons to the mix because I love the punch it gave the marinade. In addition to the ""served with"" items above, I added a simple chutney made with red pepper jelly, chopped peppadews, and diced red onion. Great-tasting shawarma without a rotisserie.","1509369215","16"
"15395838","Diane","Double the onions! In my house there are never enough. If, however you have leftover onions they are amazing in an omelet for breakfast (or anytime). This became an immediate family favorite. I serve it with tahini sauce on the side instead of the white sauce. It's also great at room temp if you want it for a pot luck or company. Just make alot!","1509371864","16"
"16811569","Elizkcmo","Love, love, love!!  This has become our go-to recipe, especially for company.  We cook it on the grill instead of the oven, which gets the edges crispy without the extra fry.","1509378700","16"
"14479014","MUP","Very good recipe.  Also easy to double.  It worked better for me to cut the onion in smaller slices than quarters - they  were sweeter and cooked better.","1509367014","15"
"15004174","Leslie Talmadge","I love this recipe, but usually cook the chicken in the marinade, which adds to the flavor.","1509369015","15"
"17394588","chad","I was short on time, so I only marinated for about 40 minutes and it was still excellent. Too much oil, so I reduced to about 1/4 C.  Next time I will double the onion. Served with orzo, chick peas, and lots of toppings, including La Cremo, yeah that's right.  I will make again.","1508867364","15"
"18579965","Ryan Scarola","Thanks so much.<br/><br/>My partner and I had this in Dubai a few weeks ago, and I tried one recipe I found online (which lacked garlic and onion).<br/><br/>One thing to try that I thought was good....throw in a bit of cardamom!","1508874936","15"
"30005146","Jeanne","Just came back to say I tried this in the crock pot because I had bone-in chicken thighs and I was afraid they would take too long in the oven.  Cooked on high about 3 hours while we went to church, and then finished in the oven under the broiler to crisp up.  It worked!  Served with risotto, greek salad, feta, parsley and yogurt sauce.","1546650156","15"
"16143870","Ellen","I didn't have time to marinate this at all, so I just dumped the meat, the marinade and the onions atop a sheet pan lined with non-stick foil and stuck it in the oven. The results were fabulous! I served it with rice, cucumbers, tomatoes, olives, garlic hummus, pita bread and tzatziki sauce. I could see that there was a lot of smoke in the oven, so I turned it off after I thought the chicken was done and let everything stay in the oven for about ten minutes until the smoke dissipated. Perfect!","1509374706","14"
"16959374","Uhura","Sam is the man! His recipes are always easy to follow, flexible and always what you really want to eat. Nobody in our foodie household ever complains when I riff on a Sifton recipe.","1509378108","14"
"21859308","Leisureguy","I’ve made this a couple of times now and like it a lot. I highly recommend using kitchen shears to cut up the chicken pieces rather than trying to do it with a knife: MUCH easier with shears.<br/><br/>I marinate about 10 hours and the chicken seems to absorb almost all the marinade: very little free liquid at the end, and I just pour that over the chicken before I put it into the oven.","1506863669","14"
"14820788","Judi","I'd suggest using a mix of Meyer lemons and ""regular"" lemons for this one. You can bump up the flavor with a little more cumin, and I frequently use half smoked and half half-sharp paprika. My husband says this is the closest thing to shawarma that he's had since Lebanon, and my Israeli friends love it too! We serve this with laffa (AKA Trader Joe's  ""Middle Eastern Flatbreads;"" puff them on the grill first); marinated feta; muhammara; and Arabic salad. In very heavy rotation in my house.","1509368762","13"
"15075693","Ilana","This is a truly fantastic recipe. I've made it four times now, and it's in my keeper pile. I always get raves. It's fantastic as written, to be honest. I like to serve it with an Israeli salad and a spiced couscous dish. It really hits the spot! <br/><br/>FYI - I tend to like cooked for the minimum of 25 minutes. It can dry out at that high heat if you cook it too long.","1509369296","13"
"16078352","Heysus","I used chicken tenders and only cook them for 20-25 minutes. Excellent!","1509374005","13"
"16795975","Laura","This is an excellent recipe.  We're vegetarian so we double the marinade and use 2 cakes of tempeh, marinating the tempeh just an hour.  It's done, in oven, in 25 minutes. We eat in warmed naan with plain yogurt drizzled on top, and sliced radishes or cucumbers.","1509377051","13"

I was flattered, but the real credit goes to NYTimes for these wonderful recipes.<br/>I reduced the amount of oil I used by 2 tablespoons, but the chicken was moist and flavorful.<br/>I will definitely cook this recipe again.","1508880815","13"
"20039264","seasonalfeast","Easy & delicious, esp for weeknights! I accidentally dumped the marinade onto the sheet pan so the chicken braised instead of roasted. I crisped sliced pieces on the stove & it was perfect. Served with a white sauce (1/2 c greek yogurt, 2 tbsp mayo, 1/2 lemon juiced + zest, 2 cloves garlic grated on the microplane, chopped parsley and salt to taste), a tomato/cucumber/parsley/lemon salad, garlic naan, hot sauce, olives and stuffed grape leaves. Even the kids (3 & 6) loved it!","1508885009","13"
"15853543","Karine","This is a must in our family. My 1 year old loves it, and so do my (very difficult) in-laws.  No onions for me, I replace them with red peppers.","1509373591","12"
"16934436","Marmac","I lived in the middle east for 8 years and this tastes almost exactly the same as shawarmas you find at any Lebanese restaurant, although they usually fill them with pickles and french fries! (I would pick them out). Excellent and easy recipe, bring on the fattoush salad and garlic cream.","1509378965","12"
"16969465","DC","Wow! Made last night, and it is terrific! Stuck to recipe except for onions-will cut onion(s) in quarters per recipe, think chicken needs that extra bite larger pieces deliver.  Served with warm pita, but I will serve with rice next time. (I found the pita to be too floury for the meat.) Not a big fan of cumin...but somehow the spice mixture becomes an amalgam of a delicious flavor with no one spice jumping out. Made white sauce (VG)-whole milk yogurt+mayo+lemon juice+garlic. Enjoyed by all!","1509378732","12"

"30407763","Kim","I double the spices and only use half so I have the mixture ready for next time (add a big pinch of allspice). I have also frozen the chicken in the marinade, I use less oil and sometimes add yogurt. When I am making the marinade I grate up an extra clove of garlic for the yogurt sauce. My chicken only takes about 20 minutes to cook. Cook on heavy duty aluminum foil and zero clean up. Thanks Sam!","1548904121","12"
"16205362","Marian V.","I put the chicken in the marinade in the morning with the intention of cooking it for dinner.  We went on an outing and got back later than we thought and had stopped to eat so when I got home, I drained the marinade off the chicken and left it in the refrigerator until the next day at noon.  I roasted it.  The extra time did not seem to hurt it.  I turned the oven to 500 for the last 10 minutes and turned the meat over.  Both sides were crispy.  It was excellent.","1509374594","11"

"15337087","Jean","This is terrific!  We lived in Riyadh in late 70's and used to have these on a regular basis.

"14928046","Lisa","My teenage boys love shawarma and decided to give this recipe a try. First, so easy to throw the marinade together, and then to throw in all in a pan for the oven- not much easier than that and last, but certainly not least- juicy and flavorful- delicious! My husband and the boys loved it! I did serve it with pita and a rice that I toasted in a little butter, cumin and turmeric and cooked in chicken broth. Served it also with the cucumbers, tomatoes and white sauce. So good!","1509369025","9"

"17118586","Jo","A great recipe - loved it!  Chicken was so juicy and flavorful and the onions were great...they were not nearly enough for the 4 of us so I would double the onions next time.  Did not have paprika so used a tsp of harissa and a tsp of red chili powder.  Used chicken breasts and baked it only for 30 mins.<br/><br/>A keeper recipe for sure!","1508868965","9"
"30473610","Erin","Whatever you do, don't skip the last step - you must sauté the chicken after you've baked and sliced it! Yes, it does make cleanup just a little bit more of a hassle, but you'll thank me later. True perfection! I like to serve with pickled red onion, cucumber dill yogurt, and fresh tomatoes.","1549335556","9"
"15395301","Susan J.","I am Armenian, and I could tell from looking at the ingredients of this recipe that I would love it. I use bone-in thighs, which turn out flavorful and juicy. It is so easy to make, and goes so well with the rice pilaf that is a staple in my house.","1509372023","8"

"29798972","Kathy ","I have made this more times than I can count. We use it in rice bowls, salads, wraps or in a pita. I serve with tzaziki sauce, feta, banana peppers, tahini sauce, chopped cucumbers and kalamata olives. So freaking delicious! The extra step of slicing & pan frying is a must! Makes it all crisp and carmelized. ","1545173666","8"
"30429821","Mike","I’ve been making this recipe for a couple of years now. You can ramp it up for very large groups. I’ve even made it for 200 people.  It’s great with lots of Mediterranean sides.  My favorite easy recipe.","1549034517","8"
"31007835","Jessie","Incredible. Placed chicken in marinade the morning of and baked in the evening. Highly recommend cutting the chicken up after it’s baked and crisping it in a pan—it takes the chicken from good to great and gives it a true shawarma feel.   The spices in this are the perfect balance, and it pairs well with grilled naan, white/yogurt sauce, and cucumbers. Delicious and not too heavy.","1552364266","8"
"109583303","Vince","This recipe has been edited. In my opinion the previous version, which instructed to have bone-in skin-on thighs, was superior. The collagen and broth leads to a much juicier dish.   The cooking time on the recipe however was not altered. 30-40 minutes is for thighs with bone and skin.   Boneless skinless thighs cooking time is 20 minutes.","1602469579","8"
"14832647","Heba","Make this all the time. Delish. Marinating for a while makes it perfect, but if you don't have time it's still great. I up all the spices and double the onions because those are my favorite part. I serve it with a parsley and barley salad also on here. Add pita or not. My Egyptian grandma may not give 5 stars for authenticity, but I give 5 for taste.","1509368624","7"
"15334998","Susan","I half the marinade and let it marinate overnite.  I cook it longer, with the marinade - I like it very browned and crisp.  I serve it with tahini sauce (no yoghurt - we don't do dairy).  It's wonderful and now one of my favorite dishes.","1509370254","7"

"21686329","Mike","Thank you Sam Sifton.  This is one of the best recipes the Times has published.  I've marinated the chicken as long as 24 hours and it is a flovro bomb!  I prefer to grill the chicken thighs over medium high heat to cook them through, then get some of that char on them.  Great for a crowd with hummus, pita, Israeli chopped salad and a little harissa or schug.","1507131945","7"
"129689868","Hannah","I've been making for years with the following adjustments:  1. Breasts instead of thighs. I've made it both ways. Both are great. Breasts are healthier. 2. Slice the onion into wedges (1cm or so) and toss with the marinade and chicken overnight. 3. Slice the chicken before marinating. Marinade coats more of the surface area of the chicken this way, and it gets a little more roasted and crispy. 4. When ready to cook, just dump it all onto a sheet pan with some parchment paper.","1702245498","7"

I immediately headed for my NY Times recipes and found this one. I've made it quite a few times since seeing it here (including tonight). I've followed the recipe as written, except for using skinless, boneless chicken breasts. The taste is so delicious and unlike any other dish I've made. I'm rereading the comments to see what others have paired with it.","1507414394","6"

"116879399","sam","Amazing as is, but … last time I made this I tossed a can of chickpeas in with four chicken thighs and onions in marinade and poured it all (with extra marinade) into a roasting pan. Same temp and time, more or less. It made something deliciously between shawarma and stew, with that same marinade flavor, just a lot more of it.","1644666111","6"
"14862147","Nancy","This was delicious, even after only marinating for an hour.  I used less cumin and added za'atar to the marinade.  Crisped up the leftovers in a pan the next day.  Great recipe!","1509369345","5"
"14884011","MarciaSF","A+ recipe.  The chicken (used boneless thighs) seemed to cook fast so I only went about 25 minutes.  Also cut the red onion pieces into eighths.  Perfect topped with some tzaziki sauce and stuffed into a pita bread...greek salad on the side.","1509369254","5"
"15528512","Tinarina","A winning recipe! I marinated the chicken for about 6 hours and next time I will try 2 or 3 hours, as the texture was already a little mushy. Unless you're cooking up an old hen, modern chicken doesn't need to be tenderized, which is what marinades are for. <br/><br/>I'm convinced less time will make this an even better dish.","1509371778","5"

"17003704","Tomoe","You basically spread marinaded chicken evenly on the oiled sheet pan to roast. I highly recommend to make them crisp like it said on the recipe. I made this when my daughter brought her friends over and it was a great hit!","1509378940","5"
"17101664","Miri","Fantastic recipe! The chicken was juicy and flavorful, and the onions tender and sweet. I didn't have turmeric, so I swapped for 1/4 tsp ginger and 1/4 tsp curry powder (I thought 1/2 tsp of either would have too pungent an effect). The marinade was delicious. Served it with harissa spiced potatoes, which I roasted in the oven alongside the chicken, and sautéed green beans.","1508867892","5"
"17228111","James Williams","As so many people have said, this is an amazing dish.  The flavors are incredible.  For the sides, I'd skip the tahini.  The mayo/yogurt/garlic/lemon juice dip was perfect!","1508868188","5"

"17640364","KayB","I did this with a whole chicken I'd cut up, making two pieces out of each breast half, along with the thighs, drumsticks and wings. Next time, I'll use boneless and cut the pieces into smaller chunks, maybe each thigh into two pieces. The marinade just doesn't penetrate the larger pieces enough. Other than that, very good.","1508869891","5"

"31251251","JoAnn","Second try - Made this tonight. Marinated for 1 hour and it was delicious. Long marinating will macerate the chicken from the lemon juice. Baked on a rack over a sheet pan and the meat browns and chars beautifully! Used boneless, skinless chicken breasts halved horizontally and watched closely so as not to overcook. 25 minutes did it. Plan to double the onions next time. And there will be a next time!","1553645574","5"
"31299227","Rose","This marinade and recipe is amazing! Grilling the chicken and onions does up it a full notch. I have made this as written too many times to count. I have also used the marinade with pork loin with great success!","1553889136","5"

"101122120","Kathryn Brown","Add an extra onion. This recipe can handle up to 3 lbs of thighs. Lightly season chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic before putting in the marinade for extra flavor. When removing meat and onion from the marinade, try to have as little of the marinade as possible accompanying it onto the sheet pan.  Two sheet pans are best if using 3 lbs. of chicken.","1561477634","5"

After defrosting I put a portion in a small roasting pan at 325 degrees for 10 minutes to bring back that roasted texture, rather than microwaving. Try it!","1618774273","5"

"130017048","Sarah in Florida","This is a great recipe, and I've made it so many times. Perfect for meal prepping lunches. If you have trouble with heartburn (like I do), apple cider vinegar instead of the lemon juice works great. I used 4 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar to replace the lemon juice and notice no difference in taste. Great for Greek pita pockets, atop a Greek-style salad, in Greek rice bowls or by itself. My boyfriend especially loves the bowls version. Enjoy!","1703442161","5"

"15589460","DB","Quick and easy recipe to prepare, I served it with a cucumber yogurt sauce and naan.  Would definitely add some spice to marinade. A tomato, cucumber salad compliments this well.  I think I will try grilling the chicken next time.  The oven roasting and crisping left the chicken a little dry but nothing I can't adjust for next time.  As suggested I increased the amount of onions and added bell peppers which I would recommend.","1509372015","4"
"15675894","FoodLover","Outstanding recipe.  Full of flavor and easy.  Also added red peppers since we had them on hand, and they were a great addition. Served with a cucumber yogurt sauce, pita, tomatoes.  A hit with all ages and great for a party.","1509373039","4"

I'd never substitute breast meat for the thighs - they'd turn out dry and definitely less flavorful.","1509374732","4"

Other than reducing it to suit my 20oz package of chicken thighs, I followed the recipe almost exactly, but substituted cayenne for the red pepper flakes and a large yellow onion for the red. Chicken was marinated for about 8 hours. I added strips of red pepper per other reviewer's suggestions. Served with the suggested yogurt/mayo/lemon/garlic white sauce kicked up with some sriracha. Wonderful!!","1509376075","4"
"16349501","abf","This was far and away the best recipe I've ever made. I bought sabra brand tzatziki (which, to my surprise, was very very good), feta, tomato, and pita, and it was a great combination.

"16956025","Sally McKee","This recipe surpasses Nigella's coriander based one. The one nit I'd pick is that Sam's suggestion of cutting some mayo into yogurt wasn't as rewarding as I'd hoped (I love mayo). I'd consider sprinkling some sumac and cutting in garlic into yogurt instead all'Ottolenghi. Also, good flat bread or at least very fresh pita bread is essential. Cucumbers for crunch. I added cilantro and parsley. Next time I'll try some pickles and radish.","1509378246","4"
"17003716","Leah","I loved this recipe and will be making it for a Xmas eve dinner with lots of goodies on the side (cukes, olives, feta, roasted veggies, olives, hummus...). There is a lot of extra liquid, but it's great drizzled on rice, or the naan/pita bread.<br/>I loved the roasted but moist texture of the chicken. It was a crowd pleaser for sure! Also mixed some plain yogurt with sour cream (can spin of from that for sure!) as a topping. DELISH!","1509378954","4"
"17004158","Naree","This was super-easy and delicious; will definitely make it again.

Think this worked to maximize the flavor.","1509378344","4"
"17902561","Dave G","Excellent!  Just a handful of inexpensive ingredients and a great technique.  It's recipes like this that make cooking a joy.  <br/><br/>Made this again with Maureen Abood's tweaks (sumac & cinnamon subbed for the cumin/turmeric/paprika; broil 3 minutes after chopping to finish instead of pan fry) and that was great as well.","1508872647","4"
"19108557","eleni","we have this in regular rotation and it's LOVED by all!<br/>we've settled on the following routine:<br/>- serve as a kind of gyro/wrap<br/>- up the amount of onions and separate them, spreading them around the pan, so that they end up caramelizing (yum!)<br/>- let more marinade stay on the chicken before it goes in the oven resulting in very moist chicken<br/>- tear apart the meat rather than slice it making it look a bit more gyro-esque<br/>- the kids love canned corn as a condiment","1508879556","4"
"20050356","Victoria","This was delicious. I would double the spices next time. I used 3 big onions, skin-on, bone-in thighs and cooked 35 minutes. I also added the grated rind of one lemon to the marinade. The leftovers are spectacular.","1508885304","4"

Even my partner who isn't keen on raw garlic said the white sauce really makes the dish.  1/2 cup plain yogurt, 1/4 cup mayo, juice of half a lemon, 1 garlic clove smashed and minced fine.  Served this with rice pilaf and Israeli Salad (tomato, cucumber, and cubanelle pepper chopped in very small dice, dressed with olive oil and lemon juice).","1506885497","4"
"23994941","Mary","Made this tonight for dinner, as written except to add red peppers to the red onions.  Broiling set off the smoke alarms. In my mind a very good sign for an oven roast dish.  Served on naan, because I like the taste better than pitas.  Made up my own sauce from hummus, yogurt and a touch of mayo and lemon. Delicious.  We had some leftover.  Looking forward to lunch tomorrow. ","1508765458","4"
"24021171","Tara G","This. This is what I've longed for since moving from D.C. to Chicago. I add maybe a 1/4 c. Greek yogurt to the marinade, and throw it in the fridge overnight. I also use chicken breasts. With homemade toum to slather all over the pilaf and shawarma...money!","1508764256","4"

"30090228","Jen"," I have made the following additions: more onion - it's so good. More chicken - it goes so fast: 3 pounds. Two pounds of carrots, which I toss in the marinade and roast with the extra red onion. An astonishing recipe!  I used chicken breasts to cut some of the fat here and reduced cook time to about 20 minutes so the chicken wouldn't dry out. It was delicious, juicy and light!","1547149600","4"

"30777331","RM","This is a staple in our house. But this week I used already cooked/grilled chicken breasts that were sort of bland. Marinated them for four hours or so and then, since they were already cooked, I just put them in a pan and crisped the chicken up. Amazing! Tasted as good as if I had made them starting with raw chicken.","1551060911","4"
"30876106","jo","I’ve made this several times.  As written and with bone-in skin-on thighs.  While they are both really good, we much prefer the bone in version. Make a small slit in each side of the thigh bone and rub in the marinade and place a spoonful  under the skin so that the meat is in  contact with the seasonings.   A bit more effort but totally worth it Especially if you need to hold the dish.","1551633000","4"

Easy to fix - with my oven, it took less time to cook - and I omitted the turmeric (for reasons) and included  green onions in the final mix.

I grew up eating chicken shawarma and while I may not have cooked it on a rotating spit, this was a winner winner, chicken dinner. <br/><br/>I made my own tzatziki sauce thanks to one of the comments below. I bought some tahini from Trader Joe's; added some harissa and hummus as additional sauces to swath on the whole wheat pita bread. I sliced up some cucumber and tomatoes to add to the color. I also accompanied it with a chickpea salad and potatoes roasted with rosemary. It was a hit.","1506864141","3"

And I always have a few packets of chicken thighs marinated in the freezer ready to go. I often end up cooking the meat on a ridged grill pan on the stove top. Grill, slice and grill a little more. I've made it on the backyard grill, too. Sometimes, I toss in some sweet or bell peppers. It's perfect every time, whether in a pita, a wrap or a salad.","1507041488","3"
"24766903","Jennifer","I was also able to make this with GROUND TURKEY!  Rather than baking chicken, I stir-fried one pound of 93% lean ground turkey with the spices in the recipe, and added the juice of ONE lemon rather than two.  It's delicious and the flavors are all still there.  That, and it's much quicker than using chicken!","1510204762","3"
"24803766","pix","I made this for dinner tonight. The chicken was in the marinade for 6 hrs. My tiny tweaks: I microplaned the zest from the lemon before juicing them and added it to the marinade; I figured- why waste the flavor? I left out the cinnamon, and used 2 large onions to roast w/the meat. Served with a salad of English cuke, grape tomatoes, feta, oregano; tossed in a garlicky vinaigrette. Flat bread, roasted carrots, and yogurt filled out the plate. Delicious!","1510460016","3"

Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towel and place a wire rack on top. In a large, deep skillet, heat 1/2 cup oil until a drop of water flicked into pan sizzles. Working in batches, fry eggplant until just tender, 20 to 30 seconds per side. Transfer fried eggplant to rack to drain. Nice with shawarma!","1519670984","3"
"26182818","Amy","More praise! This is a family favorite for us - at least twice a month! Make it to the letter - so easy and it comes out perfect! That said, I use more chicken thighs (the three of us can nearly finish off the recipe as is and we want leftovers). More onions - yes! They are so tasty. I stick the pan in while the oven finishes pre-heating for the 40 minutes, then take it out, cut it up, and stick it back in for another 5 to 10 minutes. The edges get a bit crispy - so good! Also good with rice!","1520008704","3"

I currently make this, halved; for one person (me, living alone; dinner and maybe 2 additional lunches).  But although I use all other ingredients cut in half, I cut the oil by 4 (e.g for 1 lb of chicken thighs, 2 Tbsp of olive oil is plenty).","1615700792","3"

"117848400","Nina","Really amazing, made it many times. Do not marinade for more than 12 hours. I’ve marinated for 24, and the lemon juice denatured the proteins so it made the chicken a little grainy.","1649996887","3"
"118279649","EN NOTE","Keep the sauce! If you must have crispy chicken, please read no further, but all others please try cooking the chicken & onions in the delicious sauce, instead of discarding as marinade. Spoon it all over rice, or serve with bread to sop-up the glorious sauce. No, it’s not shawarma, but neither is the original recipe (don’t tell Sam!) and the sauce is so delicious.  This also works beautifully with tofu. Cook the sauce & onions for 10 minutes in a pan, then add sliced firm tofu for add'l 10 min.","1652291823","3"
"128353744","C.Moore","Firstly, I love this dish - easy, delish, etc. A couple things I did different, if you are interested: 1.  I add the spices and lemon juice and let sit for about 15 minutes before I add the olive oil.  This allows the citric acid to break down the spices and release more flavor. 2.  I added cauliflower florets along with the onion when baking and that turned out well....now I'm thinking maybe bell peppers too....","1696970370","3"
"128378334","Ally","I added a cup of Greek yogurt to the marinade. That should help break the protein down slightly and allow the meat to be more tender and juicy. It's marinating in the fridge now. Can't wait to oven roast it tomorrow!","1697045316","3"
"130055917","Kristy","I've made this several times and enjoy it as is. Tonight I made it with 1/4 cup oil, subbed regular paprika for smoked, and added another lemon. Made tabbouleh and tzatziki and threw it all in a pita. Lovely!","1703683102","3"
"130074180","isabelle","Had about 3 cups of brussel sprouts with nowhere to go. Decided to try and use up the rest of the marinade. Brought it to a boil (was thinking of the raw chicken that had spent a few hours in it), added about 2tsp or so brown sugar before adding the quartered sprouts. Coated and sauteed, then braised. Finished with a couple tbsp soy sauce. Yum. The chicken is fab, and the marinade worth saving for another use!","1703725550","3"

"130481496","Laura T","Highly recommend this recipe.I marinated the chicken longer because I didn't have time to cook it. I used chicken tenders because that's what I had on hand. Both of my ovens have malfunctioned, so I cooked the chicken in a grill pan. Didn't have the proper ingredients for the sides but made lemon rice and a bright salad with chickpeas, tomatoes, onions, parsley with lemon/olive oil dressing. It was outstanding. I'm going to make flat breads today so that I can have sandwiches.","1705422379","3"
"130492932","Realist","Took a reader's advice and laid the chicken atop a bed of cut-up potatoes before baking. The result was nothing less than the best sheet-pan chicken dinner I ever made.

The changes I would suggest is keep the same amount of marinade but use at least 3-4 lbs of chicken and 2 red onions instead of one, it goes really fast!  A quick and easy tzatziki-ish sauce to make with it is: 1 cup Greek Yogurt, 2 Tbsp Lemon Juice, 2 cloves garlic, 1/2 tsp Salt, 1 Cup Cucumber, 4 Tbsp Cilantro Goes great with rice, Shirazi Salad, or Pita wraps","1695778080","2"
"129242332","Kathy G.","Made it tonight and OMG! It’ll definitely be a repeat in my house. Followed others’ suggestions adding more red onion and some cut up lemon to the marinade and also extending the time to overnight. With the sides mentioned, nice enough for a casual company meal.","1700274164","2"
"129575731","Alisa","Not sure if anyone will see this in time but I’m wondering if I can make this ahead, minus the final crisping, then reheat on stove top or in broiler?  My almost 12-year-old requested this for his bday dinner. I want as much as possible done in advance.","1701820599","2"
"130450536","Samantha","Just wanted to say marinate for as many hours as you can (8 hrs is our max). We love this recipe and it's a strong presence on our weekly meal prep rotation.","1705251151","2"

"130551865","Mary Bartlett","I am a little confused: after marinating the chicken and placing it on the sheet pan, you do not spread the remaining marinade over the chicken. Correct? In roasting the chicken, it produced quite a bit of juice and was certainly not 'crispy'. Also, why is the onion only cut in quarters?","1705625107","2"

"136149995","Derek","I licked the foil, great flavor! Only 15 minutes if you sub the thighs with breasts but start the onion 5 to 10 minutes before the chicken. I  I","1726186793","2"
