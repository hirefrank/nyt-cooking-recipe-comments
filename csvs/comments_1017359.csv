"14984493","AlisonK","Very good. Had to substitute spinach for arugula and am eager to try when I have arugula. Otherwise all worked well according to the recipe. I have a tip for the dill: you can freeze fresh dill. Just snip it as you would for a recipe and spread on a sheet of plastic wrap, with wide margins. Roll the plastic up like a jelly roll and close the ends with twist ties. It's easy to remove just what you need for a dish.  It's almost as good as fresh and certainly better than dried.","1509369161","1126"
"16545646","LeslieMac","Fantastic! I double up on the chicken, using skinless/boneless breasts, so I have leftovers to throw into pasta, salads, tacos throughout the week. I also use baby spinach in place of arugula. Throw it UNDER the chicken & potatoes after you take the pan out of the oven and it just wilts and absorbs the marinade and chicken juices. Mmm.","1509377393","671"
"15699171","Alexandra Lightning","Have made this wonderful recipe many times. I always seem to find another little tweak for it every time I make it. One thing that's good is to mix about a tablespoon of chopped dill into the garlic yogurt sauce and add a good squeeze of lemon juice. I always use Greek yogurt because there is no reason not to that I can discern, and it's the only kind of yogurt I have at hand. I serve this yogurt/garlic/dill sauce on the side rather than spoon it over the crispy chicken skin.","1509372633","563"
"16205836","Kathy","Would only marinate chicken overnight, not the potatoes.  They turned brown when exposed to air.<br/>Started potatoes 10 mins before chicken and they were nice and crispy. Put the leeks on top for last 20 mins and they didn't burn like some others reported.<br/>Dish on whole was highly praised and delicious","1509374759","492"
"27079613","Brian Abelson","Sublime! I substituted a baking sheet for a sheet pan. The lack of a ridge on the sheet meant that oil dripped to the bottom of the oven, causing a grease fire which I extinguished with 2.5 to 3 cups of water (this amount may vary based on the size of your oven and the intensity of the fire). I found that the fire added a delightful smokiness to the potatoes while the water used to extinguish it created steam in the oven, resulting in deliciously moist chicken. Would recommend!","1526253184","421"
"17903208","Jane","I have made this dish twice, with excellent results both times. However, on the second occasion I made some adjustments: I used a combination of skinless, boneless breasts and thighs. I used medium potatoes, and cut them into wedges (eighths), which made it easy to arrange the potatoes around the chicken. (The wedges also crisped and browned nicely, which was harder to achieve with potato slices.) And I added the dill and lemon juice to the garlicky yogurt. Easy, delicious, impressive--a winner!","1508872307","365"
"18831006","Sally","Why not Greek yogurt, Melissa?","1508878616","358"
"24096827","not being dramatic","How do I say this without being dramatic...<br/><br/>This is the best dinner I've ever made. I cook frequently, I consider it a hobby. This meal was simple, healthy, and so incredibly tasty. I'd eat this every night of my life.","1508764616","254"
"14791033","Kevin Osinski","Loved it, but proportions were strange.  1 1/2 lb bone-in chicken for 4 servings?  I used 4 leg-thighs, which came to something over 3 lb.  I used 12 oz of arugula and spread it as a serving bed for the potatoes, leeks and chicken.  The pan drippings made a nice dressing for the greens.  <br/><br/>The yogurt sauce could also be doubled or tripled.  1/3 cup over 4 servings is only one heaping tbsp each.  I added some dill to the sauce.<br/><br/>With 2 tbsp of harissa this was quite spicy, but we loved it.","1509368026","211"
"15841034","Tammy","Great recipe. First time I scattered the arugula over but that created some pretty lackluster arugula the next day when I re-heated the dish.  Next time I put the hot chicken and potatoes on top of room temperature arugula and we had perfectly wilted greens, and no soggy left over greens.  .","1509372811","199"
"18622311","Liz","Excellent. Served it for dinner guests. I used six chicken thighs and a few more potatoes, so increased proportions of marinade and sauce accordingly.  Based on all the comments, I 1) divided the recipe between two sheet pans for nice browning and crisping, 2) added the leeks when there were about 15 minutes left, 3) added some dill and lemon juice to the delicious yogurt sauce (perfect accompaniment), 4) served the chicken and potatoes on top of the arugula.","1508876096","158"
"15893950","AEC","I used Greek yogurt because it's what I had on hand.  However, I whisked a few tablespoons of milk into the Greek yogurt to thin it out.  With the addition of the milk, the yogurt now has the right consistency of what the recipe requires.","1509373407","130"
"15554810","Melissa","all I had in the refrig were boneless, skinless breasts, so covered the pan for the first 20 minutes ~ oh my were they moist and tasty. Everyone loved them. Next time will use thighs for an even tastier meal. We used much more yougurt, garlic and arugula, just because, and chopped the garlic ~ grating it was just too odd. An excellent meal!","1509372263","94"
"17121109","Sarah S","I used boneless thighs and drumsticks and doubled the recipe, and used a mixture of cubed yukon golds and halved baby red potatoes. I substituted sriracha for harissa, served chicken and potatoes over a bed of arugula with lemon juice squeezed on it, and incorporated the dill into the garlic yogurt sauce. This dish was easy and amazing. My whole family declared worthy of a once a week dinner.","1508868698","88"
"17028496","Sarah","I had only a harissa spice blend from the excellent World Spice here in Seattle. I tossed a couple of tablespoons of that with some kosher salt over the chicken thighs in the morning and let them dry out in the fridge all day. I think the dry spices plus the drying out in the fridge made the chicken skin extra crispy. Also aggressively spacing the ingredients in the sheet pan. I used two to ensure crisping and browning. This is a perfect recipe. We all loved it.","1509378559","82"
"16017357","Delicious! Will use for next dinner party.","having read the notes, i added the leeks 15 minutes before finishing. the result was soft leeks not cooked into paper.","1509374044","47"
"19209482","Judy","I've made this several times and love it -- as do my guests.  Here are a couple of hints:  I used sambal olek (Turkish) instead of harissa and tripled the amount.  I used sweet potatoes tatger than white.  I took others' advice and put the leeks on during the last 20"" (as well as the fresh spinach).<br/><br/>I chopped up cucumber, the dill and good kosher salt with the yogurt -- and made LOTS of it.<br/><br/>Thus is a great recipe!  Thank you!","1508880875","44"
"14865163","Lynda H.","Another very easy, very delicious recipe from the NYT. I used enough chicken and potatoes for 4 people and adjusted the other ingredients accordingly. I wanted more sauce, so used a 6-oz. container of yogurt and 2 garlic cloves; I also added some dill to the sauce. The leeks got too browned, so I now add them about 15-20 minutes before the dish is done. Dish also works just fine with breasts. I used srirachi (nice and spicy); want to try it with David Tanis's recipe for harissa next time.","1509369565","38"
"15402042","Katherine","Like others, I made more sauce; I used sriracha; and I and put the chicken and potatoes directly on a bed of greens -- in my case, about 5 ounces of mixed baby arugula and baby spinach for four people.  We loved it, but would have loved it more with less olive oil.  Next time, I'll just use the oil in the marinade, and let the chicken juices baste the potatoes.","1509371381","34"
"15681650","Georgette","Such a wonderful recipe.  I have made it a number of times now and served it to several people who don't get exited about chicken.  It was a great success.  And so easy.  Be sure to let the yogurt sit out for awhile so its not ice cold.","1509372878","31"
"17053947","J. Wong","Line some of the potato slices along the rim so they get crisp, if you like them like that.","1509378077","31"
"21252523","Jane","I have made this dish many times over the past year, using skinless, boneless, thighs and breast pieces, and I always make extra chicken and yogurt sauce. The leftover cold chicken, with the delicious roasted leeks clinging to it, topped with the yogurt sauce and some arugula, makes a great sandwich filling. I find a ciabatta roll works well. Really delicious!","1508858896","30"
"16267472","GL","Amazing flavor, but the potatoes were so limp and absorbed so much of the chicken fat that I found them unpleasantly unctuous (and I roasted them an extra 15 minutes). I'll definitely try this again (maybe even this week), but I'm inclined to turn it into a two pan recipe by roasting the potatoes on a separate sheet and adding a tbsp or two of the chicken fat at some point to get that wonderful depth.","1509375436","28"
"14773300","Bill G","Made this tonight. It is brilliant, Melissa! Put heavy duty foil over baking sheet so there was virtually no clean up. Made with 8 large thighs, it's for two nights. Delicious!","1509368251","26"
"15119858","Jo","I've made this 3x and have given the recipe to friends and siblings along the east coast--everyone has LOVED it!  I have used thigh/leg quarters on a per person basis which seems to come out about right.  It does need to be cooked a bit longer than stated altho with a convection oven the time is more accurate.  For those who don't like this much heat, use jarred chili sauce and drain before placing on the baking pan.  I also served it atop the arugula to let the chicken juices flavor the dish.","1509370519","24"
"16135847","cc","actually, i started the chicken skin side down and turned it over when I removed the chicken, scattered the leaks, then added the chicken as a top layer. The leaks release their liquid and give off steam which doesn't help the chicken to brown or crisp.","1509374162","23"
"17739296","chad","Very tasty and easy recipe.  I used 5 skin bone-in thighs and 5 small yukons.  I would use less oil next time, as many have noted.  I like spice so I added an extra 2 tbs of harissa.  I also added more cumin, I used at least 1 teaspoon.  Do not crowd chicken if you want crispy potatoes.  I  only marinated for 30 min and was happy with results.  I would consider using sweet potatoes instead of potatoes for nutritional value.  I would also add a few cloves of roughly chopped garlic with the leeks.","1508870484","21"
"18488177","tetedeveau","Delicious.  Used 3 bone-in skin-on thighs.  As recommended, doubled yogurt sauce (and added a squirt of lemon and dill and served on the side), used less olive oil (2-3 tbsp in all), nestled leeks (I would use more) under chicken and, finally, served all on bed of arugula (or spinach) letting the heat of chicken and potatoes wilt the veggie. Also used convection setting and cooked for 15 min, tossed potatoes, then 20 minutes more.  2-3 people.  (We were 2 but ate all because it was so good!)","1508875697","21"
"27888463","Laura","I've made around 150 NYTimes recipes in the past 18 months as part of a successful New Year's resolution in 2017. This one, for whatever reason, is my favorite. It's become comfort food for me. It is not expensive or difficult but is surprising and delicious every single time. I follow the recipe as is, but usually do a half portion for me and my husband. I use a high quality Bulgarian yogurt. I cannot recommend this dish enough.","1531863280","21"
"18686686","Sally","Whoa! Wasn't sure what to expect, but this is really, really good. Whole Foods didn't have any dill today, so had to skip that.  Used Mina harissa bought at Whole Foods. Think I may have used a medium garlic. <br/><br/> Easy enough for the 2 of us and impressive and flavorful for company! Such a nice taste left in my mouth as I write this!! Wow!","1508875793","20"
"15943987","Claire Lewandowski","Replaced half the potatoes with sweet potatoes, which turned out nicely. I'd add the leeks a little later next time - some on the sheet on the bottom rack burnt to a crisp!","1509372838","19"
"27312278","Bellaverdi","Have made this as written many times. Always wonderful, but potatoes would overcook and stick to the pan. Tonight I cut potatoes in chunks, boiled 5 minutes then drained and set aside. The recipe calls for roasting chicken pieces 15 minutes, then adding the prepared leeks. At this time I lightly tossed the potatoes with a bit of oil and also added them as well. All roasted another 30 minutes. End result was much improved and worth the extra step with the potatoes.","1527995474","18"
"27079604","Brian Abelson","Sublime! I substituted a baking sheet for a sheet pan. The lack of ridge meant that oil dripped to the bottom of the oven, causing a grease fire which I extinguished with 2.5 to 3 cups of water, though the amount may vary based on the size of your oven and the intensity of the fire. I found that this method added a delightful smokiness to the potatoes and the chicken, while the water used to extinguish the fire created steam in the oven, resulting in deliciously moist chicken. Would cook again!","1526252960","17"
"19349077","Kelly","Is it better to let the chicken and potatoes marinate over night? Or is it good with just the 30 minutes?","1508882808","15"
"18694173","Karen","To address the comment someone made re leeks on the bottom rack getting overcooked, I wanted to suggest when using two oven racks, switching the pans halfway through and reversing the front-to-back direction. This helps to ensure more even cooking. Doubling the sauce is a good suggestion!","1508876219","14"
"19798279","Alfonso","Very important to double the sauce recipe. Reserved for those who wish it. Dried dill works as well let it soak in the lemon juice a bit.","1508884634","13"
"14843633","Lesa","I love this recipe! I made it for two on an ordinary weeknight, but know I'll serve it again for company. I love the late addition of arugula -- it added texture and flavor, but was even better when we ate the leftovers and it had thoroughly wilted into the rest of the dish.<br/><br/>I used tiny, marble-sized potatoes because that is what I had on hand, and they cooked wonderfully with the chicken. I also added a liberal amount of sweet paprika to everything, which added both color and punch.","1509369652","12"
"18523398","Chris","Freaking amazing. Never commented before, but this was just too good. I made it exactly as written, only without the dill. Rave reviews all around. Don't change a thing!","1508876272","12"
"22747693","Lucretia M.","As a low-carb option, I substituted eggplant instead of potatoes -- delicious!","1506870339","12"
"15096157","Emily B","This is wonderful for a casual dinner party.  It is pretty spicy but I had extra yogurt on the table for toning down the heat, if needed.  I also sprinkled pomegranate seeds on top just before serving.","1509369171","11"
"20973981","recox","I followed ALL of the tips: Put arugula under the chicken so it coats with pan juices; add 1 tbsp chopped dill, squeeze of lemon and some zest to greek yoghurt and serve it on the side; add leeks in last 15 minutes, stirring them into the bottom so they don't blacken. I use sriracha, but have cooked it without for the heat-intolerant. Either way is good. I agree the chicken weight is off or I am using hugely muscular chicken thighs. Six for 4 people. No need to adjust other amounts.","1508858476","11"
"30731371","frankie","we love savory with sweet, so I used yams instead of yukon golds. also, I marinated the chicken overnight w/a combination of harissa, plain yogurt and a mediterranean spice mix (cumin, garlic, sumac, urfa, dill, spearmint & lemon). After reading others' reviews I made the following adjustments as well: marinated chicken, not the yams; roasted starch & chicken on two pans; started the yams 15 minutes before the chicken, added the leeks 20 minutes before the chicken was done. we devoured it!","1550773828","11"
"15392618","Karen","This is the second time making this recipe and it was even better this time.  I put the chicken, potatoes and leeks on the bed of arugula and dill, and sprinkled the whole thing with the o.o. and lemon, and served the yogurt/garlic mixture on the side.  It was a total winner at our dinner party. Can't wait to do it again.","1509371433","10"
"21538577","PJ","I've made this now about 5 times, and usually just remember to start the marinade 30 minutes before. It's always wonderful- the combination of the chicken and potatoes in the intense sauce, with the leeks, arugula and yogurt on top tastes so complete. Tonight, it was with roasted cauliflower and roasted cubed rutabaga, which worked well with the intense flavors of the harisa and cumin.. this is a real keeper.","1508866841","10"
"17029078","Kristina","My son, who is a very basic cook, called requesting an easy, not too time consuming recipe that he could serve to his professional chef friend without embarrassment.   I have made it several times and was pretty sure he could make and serve this with confidence.  This recipe was a big hit.","1509378164","9"
"17065488","Liz","An excellent meal.  Left out cumin and substituted boneless , skinless breast for thighs and legs. Used additional  arugula as a bed for the meat and potatoes which made for an attractive presentation.  Would definitely make again and worthy of guests.","1509378312","9"
"24910695","Martin G","Doubled the recipe excepting the yogurt saice which I tripled. Do not marinate the potatoes, toss them with extra harissa sauce just prior to cooking. Extend the cooking time by ~5 minutes. As others suggest, add the leeks in the last twenty minutes, put the dill in the yogurt sauce, add sweet potatoes along with the regular potatoes, and serve it on the fresh arugala after cooking (OK so it's a 2 dish meal). Was enough for six people with a couple of lunches left over. Delicious and easy.","1511223220","9"
"30680320","Melody","Foolproof, forgiving and delicious. For 4 people, I used 3lb of chicken and about 2lb potatoes, while doubling the marinade. Worked nicely!","1550511185","8"
"14771609","Laura","Great recipe, although the arugula felt distracting. Could benefit from being tossed with the roasted potatoes and leeks when they are removed from the oven so it wilts.","1509368159","7"
"14983236","Jean Rutter","Chicken was fantastic (I used sriracha and split two leg-thighs) but the leeks scorched. I'd wait longer before adding them. I used plain yogurt as sauce because I don't like raw garlic, added a nice tangy taste. Next time: fewer potatoes, and more leeks.","1509369161","7"
"15148920","DTN","I made this with skinless, boneless chicken thighs and siracha and it was very good. Next time around I will reduce the amount of potatoes (a bit too heavy) and increase the leeks, lemon zest, and yogurt sauce which is delicious. I'll also cut the potatoes smaller - while they cooked through, they were not at all crispy. House smelled great though!","1509370835","7"
"27085687","Betsey","Modified based on several comments and personal preference: - only used thighs (not big drum fans here) - cut potatoes into wedges instead of slices - added lemon and dill to yogurt sauce - used a mix of arugula and spinach because it's what I had - placed hot food on top of greens instead of greens on top Delicious, would definitely make again!","1526313772","7"
"20246409","Jessica","I was so excited to make this this week and was NOT disappointed.  I couldn't get fresh Dill so I left that out. I also somehow lost my sheet pan (seriously.. only me) and used a roasting pan. STILL delicious. The yogurt sauce is magical. I doubled the marinade and I also doubled the yogurt sauce and subbed in sriracha instead of harissa. This is definitely a show stopper. Great for a dinner party and actually fairly affordable. I used a large pack of chicken thighs.  Amazing. Thank you NYT","1508886178","6"
"21340547","Chris","I was blown away by this recipe and have made it many times since.  So easy to make but also such great flavors (the lemon zest in the leeks- so good!).  I follow it pretty much to the letter and have almost no issues.  If you put the pan too high up in the oven the leeks start to burn, but moving them around once or twice does the trick.  The first time I made this I lived in a smaller town and couldn't find harissa.  Sriracha was NOT as good- a little too vinegar forward.","1508866469","6"
"24400819","deb ","Used shallots instead of leeks","1507690849","6"
"15361700","Memphis girl","Ohhhh man, where do I start? This was a big pay off! Such a complex tasting recipe which wasn't too difficult to make. I eat a lot of chicken, and have been trying new recipes for the variety. I used bone-in, skin on breasts, and sriracha instead of Harissa. Instead of serving it in the pan, I deboned the chicken into bite sized pieces and made a chicken salad of sorts using the yogurt and arugula/dill mixture.","1509370473","5"
"16203868","Kathy","What to do with liquid and marinade left over from keeping in refrig. overnight?  Throw away?","1509374469","5"

"23395189","GiGi","Use mor arugula . Serve chicken on top of it.","1506878210","5"
"26120442","Joni","I was also confused about that, so I just pushed the potatoes around a bit.  I did not put the chicken above the potatoes.  I found the same recipe, credited to Melissa,  in a google search on a non-NYT site, and the directions said to cut the potatoes in 1.5"" chunks, instead of slicing them, which worked better.  I think slices would have overcooked.","1519670429","5"
"30644884","Orlynur","This was soo delicious! I used kale because I didn’t have arugula. Served the chicken on top and it wilted perfectly.","1550256115","5"
"131199108","Shannon","I never write reviews, but this dish is so good and so reliable that it warrants one. I marinate the chicken and potatoes for about an hour, draining the excess liquid before placing them on the sheet pan. I agree with other commenters who suggest using the arugula as a bed on a serving platter and spooning everything else on top, so the leaves gently wilt. I like to stir in some lemon juice to my yogurt sauce, but to each their own. If I could give this 10 stars, I would.","1708044914","5"
"131654949","Robin B","Even better with sweet potatoes- which turn out to be amazing with arugula.","1709730563","5"
"15145659","Patti","Second time I've cooked this. Got way too much spinach from the csa this week, so substituted that for the arugula, added a bit more pepper and lemon to balance.  Perfect.","1509371090","4"
"16478174","Richard Wells","This was fantastic.  Super tender chicken, delicious spuds.  Yogurt sauce was perfect, though I doubled up on the garlic.  Next time, more spuds, and thinly sliced onions instead of leeks.  Leeks didn't hold up to baking.  I'm not sold on the unadorned arugula. I'd like to figure out an enhancement for that.","1509375777","4"
"23277466","DCal","Doubled the recipe and used two pans.  As expected, the listed cooking time wasn't enough to make the potatoes and chicken skin crispy.  Any recommendations on how much extra cooking time is needed for a double batch?","1506877435","4"
"25493208","Angela","Major hit in our household, and easy/cheap to boot.   Just turned the leftovers into a lunch salad: I dressed the remaining bunch of arugula with a vinaigrette of olive oil, champagne vinegar and pomegranate molasses. Then piled the potatoes, chicken, leeks, and yogurt sauce on top.   The sweetness of the pomegranate molasses brightened it up. Will make extras for next time too.","1515528622","4"
"25500076","Hungryman","This dish gets the hungryman seal of approval! Simple to make, hearty, and extremely delicious. Hungryman likes to make more sauce than is recommended, but is otherwise speechless!","1515576646","4"
"26822411","ManEatingPotato","Try adding preserved lemons to the marinade.  Adds a lemony umami depth that can’t be described.","1524323039","4"
"30357987","Wisoc003","Y’all, this recipe is so good, and super forgiving! It’s in regular rotation at our house, and most of the time I’m missing some ingredients. Rarely do I make the yogurt sauce (though it is delicious), I don’t usually add the dill (though also delicious), I like it better sans cumin. Sometimes we add carrots along with the potatoes for a more complete meal. One tip - when adding the leeks make sure they’re on the pan instead of on the chicken. They are amazing when caramelize in the drippings. ","1548638631","4"
"100077263","VHackman","Awesome combination of flavors. Only change was putting arugula below rather than above chicken and potatoes. Smells so good while cooking. The leeks are a wonderful addition. Cooking time and temp were perfect for my oven, potatoes lightly crispy and thighs well cooked yet moist.","1555635011","4"
"131665563","siri","I have made this 3x now and highly recommend roasting the potatoes for 15-20 minutes before adding the chicken to the pan (depending on size of potatoes). Each time I’ve had to take the chicken off to prevent overcooking and let the potatoes continue. I’ve also added chunks of red onion and/or zucchini slices to this which were great additions. I have made it thrice because it is fantastic and the result greater than the sum of its parts.","1709748578","4"

"14846597","Susan R","Because Greek yogurt is too thick and the consistency isn't right for a sauce.","1509369803","3"
"14859361","Samantha","One of the most delicious/easy ratio dinners I've every made! Subbed sriracha for the harissa and only used 1 tbsp  which resulted in the perfect amount of heat for me.","1509369888","3"
"14978314","D Demoney","This recipe was wonderful, but I think the oil in the marinade is superfluous, since the chicken thighs have enough fat in the skin.  Absolutely delicious, simple, and if you don't toss the arugula with the entire pan of chicken, works very well as leftovers","1509369280","3"
"15076335","Rose","Potatoes and arugula are lovely sides, but when I don't have them I make just the chicken with sauce and its Awesome!","1509369015","3"

"16222828","AJ","Used 1 TBSP less olive oil for the marinade + four chicken thighs + 1 large sweet potato and otherwise followed the recipe to the T. It was delish! I'd maybe make a bit more yogurt sauce next time. And I'm not sure why the recipe instructs not to use Greek yogurt; I did, without incident.","1509374784","3"
"18793496","Emily Melnick","Great. Tired of potatoe so we used parsnips and I wasn't disappointed. We aren't hot sauce fans but happen to have some Sriracha mayo hanging around so I used that. Still very flavorful. Leeks added a wonderful flavor.","1508876957","3"
"20239088","MLS","I see you used ""the honey"" in the marinate, however it is not called for in the recipe (at least not in the one online that I am looking at now).  How much honey did you add?","1508885179","3"
"21669806","Thomas Robson","Extremely happy with this simple yet very delicious recipe.<br/><br/>The harissa + cumin marinade has terrific potential for so many other dishes and cuts of meat! I'll be playing with that for some time to come.<br/><br/>If you have whole cumin seed in your pantry, it's definitely worth the little bit of extra effort to freshly toast and coarsely grind some for this recipe. You can safely increase the amount of cumin if you do this. Freshly toasted cumin is so mellow and sweet!","1506862802","3"
"25942143","Irina","I made this last night, without the arugula but everything else exactly as is and it came out AMAZING. Will add this to my regular rotation because it was delicious!! The harissa made it VERY spicy but the yogurt sauce was a good counterbalance to it. I also shredded in some cucumber into the yogurt and tripled the garlic, as I usually do.","1518535806","3"
"27917756","New favorite recipe. Ever.","Simply outstanding. I used whole legs which made a nice ""fancy"" presentation. Also, instead of ground cumin, I used whole cumin seeds which gave it a slightly nutty + exotic flavor.  I also ended up taking the arugula back off the top and tossing it in the bowl I'd used for the leeks to pick up all the leftover bits. I then served the chicken and potatoes on top of the arugula salad so it got all nice and wilted.   I could make this daily and die happy. Thanks Melissa Clark!","1532022595","3"
"30657719","Liss","I've made this incredible recipe with both chicken and, when making it for a vegetarian roommate, eggplant. If you're looking for a nice veggie substitute, it's delicious to use a large eggplant cut into thicker slices than the potatoes, marinated exactly as you would the chicken. It's so good!","1550344948","3"

"131148732","VHackman","I've made this recipe many, many times, because it is so good. But we find that using bone-in thighs with skin makes a huge difference...from really good (using boneless, skinless thighs) to absolutely fantastic! The chicken skin provides fat that makes the potato slices extra crispy and flavorful. Well worth the extra calories.","1707865699","3"

"20152741","PJ","I just made this for friends, and it was outstanding. It was very easy to make earlier in the day, and then simple to bake while we were enjoying wine before dinner. I served the chicken and potatoes over the arugula, and all the flavors came together very nicely. I made 4 1/2 pounds of chicken and 4x the marinade recipe, I used Greek yogurt but cut it with some milk, and it was a really bright, flavorful meal. I'll definitely make this one again","1508885634","2"
"20181839","Allison","I have made this several times and this recipe is a keeper. I use Sriracha and put the chicken in a bag with the honey, olive oil and cumin. I do not put the potatoes in the Sriracha marinade. It has a nice, easy kick and the sauce provided a good balance. I do not have good luck finding leeks so I roast regular onions with the potatoes. I have let the chicken sit much longer than 8 hours and it was still delicious. My partner loved the sauce.","1508885640","2"
"21267589","joyce","If the arugula is mature, I put it under, but if it's baby arugula, I wouldn't do that. The freshness of the arugula adds another layer of flavor and texture.","1508857360","2"

"25038951","Sanjana B","I love this recipe! I use Trader Joe's Harissa, and season and cook the potatoes (I add brussel sprouts) separately. I also make a tzatziki sauce to go with it, but the yogurt sauce listed here is great too if you want a lighter flavor. I like to finish it off in the broiler for an extra char. I followed the others' recommendations and plated the hot food on top of the arugula, so it was perfectly wilted. A quick and easy recipe that I'll surely make again.","1512095978","2"
"27244323","dee kap","Great recipe. My personal preferences / adjustments were: - grating the garlic seemed unnecessary - easier to mince or make a paste in a hand blender and mix it in. I’d also use more garlic (3 cloves) if you want the yogurt flavor to be less yogurty - less oil - not sure why all that is necessary, skip it as a drizzle too - just use lemon juice - again, no need to grate - chicken amount seemed odd so I just went with what I had and adjusted the other ingredients accordingly - use more sriracha","1527479255","2"

"27999004","Ann S","This was the best chicken recipe I've made in a long time.   I did not include the potatoes, and it was still fantastic.  The leeks were deliciously caramelized and crispy. The chicken was tender and flavorful.   This will be my new go-to! Leftovers were amazing in the following days.","1532538783","2"
"28917991","Gordon Capern","I loved this recipe.  The second time I made it, I dialed back the harissa a bit.  I preferred it that way -- loved the heat, but a bit too much for my Nordic palate.","1538828306","2"
"29196533","RachelM","A-ok the first night, but spouse and I almost fought over the leftovers-- it was so much better the second day once the flavors melded. Used chopped boneless skinless chicken breast-- briefly marinated-- and used Greek yogurt thinned with lemon juice as the finisher (raw garlic is a non starter here). Just harissa potatoes and lemon yogurt is a winner. Next time I'd roast potatoes for 15 min before adding chopped chicken breast and leeks.","1540763058","2"
"29884931","Rosie","One of my family’s favorite chicken dishes. I use on the bone chicken breasts and separate the chicken and potatoes on two sheet pans.  Potatoes get crispy that way. Serve over arugala with the yogurt sauce. So yummy!","1545695294","2"
"30040874","K","My mods added to effort, but worth it, imo...  whenever I do chicken thighs I “pre-braise” at 300 degrees, covered, for about an hour.  Otherwise they’re never done to my liking.  Anyway, did that with the marinated thighs, then separated the juices from the rendered fat and tossed the potatoes with the fat and roasted them separately.  I used the juices to baste the thighs and leeks.  When potatoes were browned, added them to thigh/leek pan to finish the process.","1546904178","2"
"30933560","Barbara Gentry","Excellent recipe!! I had arugula in the fridge that needed to be used, and not much kitchen time. Used sliced shallots & onion (no leeks on hand) and dried dill (same reason). Used sriacha instead of harissa. Otherwise, followed the recipe. Next time, I'll be sure to use fresh dill and try the harissa (with luck it will keep forever like sriacha?). My favorite Bulgarian-style yogurt (White Mountain) was perfect - just enough tang. Delicious!!","1551927730","2"
"100853072","Diana","Good. Used boneless thighs, trimmed of fat. Cut potatoes in wedges. Used 1 T sriracha, plenty hot. Only added leeks last 15 mins. Placed arugula on serving platter, covered in cooked chicken/potatoes, added lemon juice and chopped dill. Topped w/yogurt sauce made with chopped garlic, dill, s and p.  Really tasty. Thanks to previous posters for their suggestions.","1559960573","2"

I used chicken breast instead of thighs (just had them on hand)- 425 for about 25 minutes, adding the sliced leeks around the 10 minute mark. Made my own harissa paste (harissa powder plus olive oil and garlic). Served on top of the arugula with the yogurt sauce (extra garlic, no dill (store was out) and I used Greek yogurt), squeezed a bit of fresh lemon. This is going in our regular rotation.","1674605272","2"

Followed other reviewers and added lemon juice and dill to the yogurt sauce (used plain greek yogurt). Also added some smashed garlic cloves in with the leeks. Total cook time for me (with a mix of thighs and drumsticks) was 40 minutes. Did just chicken and potatoes for 30, added the leeks+garlic for the last 10. Serve everything over bed of arugula. Will make again!","1707961423","2"

"131739200","siehomme","I'm all in with this recipe. It takes my humble chicken-olive oil-potatoes-garlic sheet pan meal and elevates it without that much more work. The easy garlic sauce is the chef's kiss of the dish. Used gochujang instead of harissa because the tub was staring at me, bereft, from the refrigerator shelf. I heated the sheet pan before adding the potatoes (put in the potatoes 10 minutes before, thanks all) and they got nicely crispy. Also followed others in putting in the leeks 15 minutes before.","1710022495","2"
"131742449","Jessica","Delicious! This recipe got raves from everyone who ate it. I used sriracha, boneless skinless breasts and baby spinach as substitutions. I took the suggestion of some other readers and put the baby spinach under the chicken at the end, also mixed the lemon and dill directly into the yogurt (served on the side), and put the potatoes in at the end of the marinade. I used tiny little new potatoes, so did not need to slice or wedge -- perfect!","1710056086","2"

I put the leeks in for 15 minutes at the end; they were soft and still had lots of flavor, not overcooked. I seasoned the yogurt with dill and lemon. This is a perfect, casual, dinner party option.","1712013206","2"
"132298323","Benjamin","I will be making this again. It was so good. I used half potatoes and half fennel cut into about the same size chunks. Next time I honestly might just use only fennel and have a baked potato for the side if I'm craving a potato. While the potato was great in the dish, the fennel had this wonderful artichoke like texture and nice nuttiness. I also chopped up the fennel tops and blended them into the yogurt as a sub for dill.","1712176714","2"

Used Greek yogurt for final drizzle--added some water to thin it.  Ridiculously delicious, beautiful presentation!","1726681454","2"
