"18928549","Lori","I've made this twice. The first time I strained it, per recipe. It was good, seemed more like juice than gazpacho. Would probably be good with a little vodka and Tabasco. But I missed the fiber, so the next time I puréed the heck out of it, but did not strain. I liked it better. Drank the vodka straight. :)","1508877613","4700"
"23734480","Alicia","I am from Madrid but spent almost all the summers before I was 28 yr-old in Andalucía, where I own a place. Your recipe is pretty accurate but I want to give you some feedback. First of all, I definitely use less oil. We also add a pinch of cumin and we leave half the peel of the cucumber on for better digestion. Last, we add the white center of days-old bread (a third or half of a French baguette-like) soaked in vinager, to the blender. The bread makes it really creamy, great use of old bread!","1506882877","3687"
"15875315","Tom","In short: Strain the soup. I learned by experience.<br/><br/>The first time, it seemed so nicely liquified, using the Vitamix, that I served it as was, seemingly delicious.<br/><br/>The second time I strained it and the soup was transformed. The flavors so precise, unusual in purity, they required no garnish, no drizzle, no crouton. The guests were in unanimous agreement on this point.<br/><br/>Other notes: go a bit shy with the sherry vinegar and salt, you can add more later if needed. A little goes a long way.","1509372859","1204"
"27077540","Patricia","Ok,this is the second time that I made this with....hold your breath!! Canned San Marzano tomatoes! Gasp,cough,cough!! Turned out excellent each time and what a saver of time.  Did not strain and I also put in a squeeze of tomato paste for good measure. Perfect!! Chilling now in the fridge, cheers!","1526227781","928"
"15664539","Alan C Brown","Everyone liked it. A cautionary note- if you make it in the food processor, there is a reason for that Fill line marked at the bottom third of the plastic container - makes a big foamy mess all over your counter  if you just fill the whole thing up with the ingredients and process away assuming nothing will run over.......","1509373069","875"
"27786074","Helen","This is indeed how we make it in Seville! A few things -Smaller, sweeter varieties of tomato are usually better (juicy, not meaty...no beefsteak for example). -Flash boil the tomatoes to peel them (along with coring them) and you'll save yourself the step of straining, which some people say takes away from the flavor. -Remove the germ from your garlic, or you'll be tasting it all night. -The part about chilling at least 6 hours is bologna.. just chill till cold or stir in ice cubes.","1531168243","701"
"15616160","Momo","Surprisingly authentic compared to most recipes.  Not sure the onion belongs.  Be careful with the pepper....omit if cubanelles are not available.  A regular green bell pepper ruins the gazpacho.","1509371429","632"
"22895169","Sue","Great recipe and very authentic to what I enjoyed in Barcelona.  After rough chopping the vegetables (and by the way I prefer without the onion), I salt and leave for about an hour.  This develops a ton more flavour.  Then puree, making sure to add oil very slowly for a good emulsification.  Finally I reserve small amount of the vegetables to fine chop and add at the end for a bit of texture (only if you're going to eat from a bowl rather than drink from a glass).","1506871903","450"
"15655094","mchristiekroll","Gaspachamole.  I added a dead ripe avocado and it whips into something airy. Doesn't need to be strained. Top with chimichurri as garnish. Not sure if it's soup, sauce or dip, but gracious it is good.  Going to try it on polenta.","1509373469","406"
"19423600","Chula","It's the real deal, this recipe. My mother in law living in Tarragona, Spain taught me to make it like this. Sometimes leaving out garlic, depending on the guests. I use a deep red bell pepper when I make it in the early summer, to sweeten the taste, when the tomatoes are still not fully ripened.","1508881826","352"
"18830898","Kate","My go-to cold soup cheat: Left over tossed salad, clove of garlic, plain yoghurt. Blend. Done","1508877551","332"
"16004632","Eddie","I've made this recipe several times, and it seems to separate whenever the tomatoes, onion and/or cucumber are especially juicy. The thing to do, especially when working with ripe ingredients, is to add the olive oil in step 2 very, very slowly, making sure it fully emulsifies before adding more. On the other hand, if the gazpacho separates in the fridge, just give it a good stir with a wooden spoon before serving. It's still just as delicious (and nobody is any the wiser!).","1509375029","282"
"15704766","Nicole Gardner","This is actually a great emergency dish: you don't need 6 hours  ... <br/><br/>Once (emergency) I made it at 6 pm, put it in a metal bowl in the freezer, stirred twice, and enjoyed it an hour later (after stirring well to melt and incorporate the tiny frozen bits).<br/><br/>Also, if your tomatoes are not perfectly ripe and flavorsome, you can cheat by adding a bit of high quality tomato paste. <br/><br/>Straining makes this exceptionally lovely on the tongue.","1509372839","274"
"15618260","Steve Muni","If you can't get cubanelle peppers, you might try an Anaheim.  Or use some sweet red pepper instead.","1509371913","271"
"15646934","sheila","I never liked gazpacho until we made this today from the first to ripen of our bumper crop of tomatoes. I could live on it, and might, expecting radiant health and a welcome weight loss (except on days I add vodka to it). Made exactly as written, using a Vidalia onion, cubanelle pepper and finishing it by liquefying in a standing blender. I prefer to drink it, and wouldn't add bread, which would dilute the pure and perfectly balanced vegetable flavors, and make it heavy. Thank you, Julia!","1509371379","270"
"16012038","Patricia","I strained it before adding the olive oil, and it was fine.  It is a lot less messy to add the oil after the messy part is done.","1509374032","162"
"15658315","John Duncan","A little bland. Maybe my beefsteak tomatoes were less than tasty.  I added another clove of garlic, 2T tomato paste, 1t Tabasco, extra sherry vinegar. THAT brought it up to speed.","1509372865","128"
"15656116","Bernice Glenn","The recipe I use is from Elizabeth David's ""Mediterranean Food"", from the mid 1960's. Davis, a long-time resident and food researcher of the region, describes: ""The basis of them is chopped tomato, olive oil, and garlic, and there may be additions of cucumber, black olives, raw onion, red peppers, herbs, eggs, and bread.<br/>Sometimes gazpacho is presented in large deep cups, sometimes in shallow soup plates.<br/>Moskin's version is just one of the many variants served in different parts of Spain.","1509373630","126"
"15659314","Lyn","This is the best gazpacho I've ever had! I have grown very tired of eating a bowl of salsa, which is what many recipes are like. It's great just like it is, it needs no doctoring in my opinion.","1509373628","126"
"15626037","Carol","I made this almost exactly but added about 2 cups day-old crustless white bread (soaked for a couple minutes in water, then squeezed), extra garlic, an anchovy, and a red chile pepper all mashed to a pulp and blended into the final product. I guess it's true that everyone has their favorite way to do this--I was craving something a bit more substantial. The sherry vinegar is a really wonderful addition that I hadn't explored previously and the olive oil, as she notes, is KEY.","1509371901","124"
"15873727","Dana","Simply put, this is the best gazpacho I've ever had. Can't recommend it enough.","1509373121","92"
"16199462","Tom Olsen","Great recipe. If you have a powerful blender there is no need to strain since there are virtually no solids left after two minutes in the blender. I added a 1/4 teaspoon of Tapatio hot sauce for just a little kick.","1509374037","86"
"16005487","Sue Llewellyn","Before I make this, does anyone have any thoughts about straining out the solids BEFORE drizzling in the olive oil? Am thinking it MIGHT stay emulsified longer that way...","1509374363","81"
"15873568","Stacey","This is my third weekend making a double batch.    For the double, I use only one pepper and a bit less than double the onion. In used a blender and strained it, but there was very little in the strainer.  Each batch is a bit different depending on which far stand I've visited.  Last week, I separated a bit out and blended in some watermelon... Very good.  Don't skimp on the olive oil!","1509373257","73"
"18793885","SonomaSMB","I would freeze the veggie purée without the olive oil, then thaw and emulsify with oil.<br/><br/>I plan to try this method this summer - would be a great way to preserve fresh summer flavors.","1508877762","72"
"28561779","Sarah C","Having spent 20+ summers in Spain I am extremely picky about having authentic flavor, color & texture. This is almost exactly my recipe but for one detail.  A favorite aunt taught me to add 1/3 cup blanched almonds. Without adding bread you can alter the consistency just a touch. Also, it is often served with a dish of finely chopped white onion, peppers and tomatoes to garnish with a splash of olive oil and red wine vinegar.","1536626040","57"
"27876154","alterations and notes","I added some dungeness crab and avocado as garnish, which made for a really nice, light summer meal. ","1531794889","49"
"23327289","Bjorn Mattsson","I had a place in Costa Del Sol for about years and to make the local Gazpacho we used a couple of cups of stale white hard crust Spanish bagetts and let them soak up a good deal of the liquid. 4 crushed cloves garlic instead of one.<br/>Make sure to remove any seed and skinn from the tomatoes, peppars and cucumber<br/>Afterward use a Waring stick immersion blender and run it until uniform and smooth. If too viscous and more vinegar or white wine. The Spaniard in Andalusia do not strain their Gazpacho.","1506877526","45"
"19482221","Tom","I use a Vitamix and a regular kitchen strainer, not too fine. With some batches, very little stays in the strainer. Other times, the strainer gets plugged up half way through. I add the strained residue to something else, like beans or red rice.","1508882535","39"
"15929764","Keith","I served in a bowl, not a glass. Nice touch is to drizzle a little of the sherry vinegar in addition to the olive oil in each bowl just before serving. Looks good and enhances the flavor","1509372782","37"
"15970249","Lynnjehle","I still go back to the Gazpacho recipe Craig Claiborne published in the Times the Summer of 1965!  Living in a RR apartment on an unfashionable (yes!) block of East 84th street and growing herbs in my window box.","1509374868","34"
"19172302","patxcook","I want to reiterate, if you have not tried this recipe do so at once. I  eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Wonderfully refreshing in the middle of a hot summer.  I know some of you will complain about the 1/2 cup of olive oil, but just try it.","1508879392","34"
"27946526","Kary","Please do not leave out the garnishes (passed around the table in bowls):  chopped cucumber, tomato, onion, and small croutons.....even bacon crumbles or avocado.   We live in Spain, and gazpacho is sometimes served (without garnishes) as an aperitivo, or an amuse bouche between courses in small liqueur Glasses.","1532188548","31"
"15662783","dominiquelemagnifique","Excellent recipe. Not having sherry vinegar handy, I used<br/>rice vinegar instead. Also, rather than straining the mixture, I used the blender and got a very smooth texture. Will repeat many more times!","1509373333","28"
"16018773","SC","Add finely chopped zucchini, poblano peppers (in place of cubanelle), handful of roughly chopped cilantro. Use less olive oil (1/4 cup). Delicious!","1509374560","28"
"23104554","Sylvia","Shortcuts: Follow basic recipe but use  V8 low sodium as a base in place of fresh tomatoes. Omit the onion. Use Serrano chiles removing seeds & veins. Peel cukes & remove seeds. Be generous with the olive oil adding SLOWLY as mixture is blending. Add salt to taste. Food purists: be kind & understanding","1506875099","27"
"18813279","Lynn","If there is any leftover, this makes a nice base for a bloody mary the next day, with a bit of tabasco added.","1508877209","26"
"19260418","Marla","I made this today for an outside BBQ and followed the directions as written, including the straining.<br/><br/>I have to say that this was, hands down, the best gazpacho I've ever had. And I've been making it for years. I was afraid the emulsion would break, once it was stored in the fridge, but that didn't happen.<br/><br/>My local farmstand had tomatoes available that they recommend only for sauces and soups and they were half price. So red and delicious and perfect for this recipe!","1508880135","25"
"15796742","JM","I made this in my Ninja smoothie maker through step 1, which liquefied everything and eliminated the need for straining.  I took the blade off and used an immersion blender right in the cup to blend on the oil. Tasted before it went in the fridge and understood the comment about the fluffy texture. The color was gorgeous even before the oil was added. I did use 2 garlic cloves and a whole Tablespoon of the sherry vinegar. Will be delicious with dinner tonight.","1509372673","24"
"15939033","Clare","Has anyone made this and frozen it successfully?  Want to make this for an event in late September and was hoping I could make it now and freeze it.","1509373537","24"
"102365953","Dianne","Don't throw out those solids!  I mixed them with a little more vinegar, salt, and olive oil to create a spread and used some of it on sandwiches.  Yum!  I also added some chopped olives and minced garlic to the remaining spread to create a nice tapenade.","1567712549","22"
"19528580","Diane B.","I'm confused by the comments that it is like juice.  Drizzle the oil in and it emulsifies like mayonnaise.  It IS the best.","1508881873","21"
"16078207","Wednesday","I use 1/2 t salt, sightly less olive oil, Sherry Reserva from Spain, and Don Carlos evoo from Spain","1509374254","20"
"25772711","Ryan","I love this recipe. I have a mug of this in my fridge all the time. It's really versatile and can be easily altered to suit one's taste. I added celery, more garlic, some lime juice and increased the vinegar to a tablespoon. A bit more acidic but that's how I like it. Key is to also use really good olive oil. The cheap stuff has no olive flavour which is needed to really rounds out this soup.","1517415914","20"
"30775634","Ann","Absolutely delicious. Lives up to the billing.   You could almost reserve the solids, and, if you have a loaf of french bread around, make a sort of pan con tomate with them.","1551036958","18"
"15917261","John Bower","Delicious!  Made with my homegrown tomatoes, but here in NW WA even in the hot summer of 2015 my tomatoes aren't super sweet, so I added a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar.  Makes all the difference.  Really good!","1509372990","17"
"15967102","Tom","Very easy to make. Liked that you could serve it as a cocktail. Works well with a little rum.","1509374644","17"
"19035878","Antonio Navarro Jr","This has nothing to do with this gazpacho and there are many varieties throughout Spain but my favorite to have on a hot day is a very simple one made with water, a bit of vinegar (to taste), a bit of olive oil (to taste), cucumber chopped very fine and onion chopped very fine. Chill and drink. For my simple taste, the best","1508879815","17"
"19557655","Lisa","OMG this soup is delicious. I followed directions exactly.  I made it in my Vitamix and tried it both strained and un-strained. It was a little silkier when strained but I liked it both ways. I used tomatoes that I had vacuum sealed whole and then frozen from the garden last summer.","1508882805","17"
"15650604","Nina","I added about 1/2 cup fresh mint & 2 tablespoons fresh basil. I used half red  teardrop tomatoes that were given to me with half Sungold cherries from my garden. This is delicious!","1509371753","16"
"15813297","Kim Severson","Make this, exactly as it is, and serve it in a cold glass with a little drizzle of olive oil on the top. Best summer app ever.","1509373679","15"
"15910877","TB","Has anyone tried freezing this?","1509372808","14"
"19635301","stacey","while this kept my live-in dishwasher (read: partner) well-occupied (double the recipe + multiple steps + multiple batches required in my small, 20-year old cheap college apt blender = several 'in between stage' large bowls, oy!), between blending for long enough on 'liquefy' and properly straining it, the texture was gorgeous!!! and it emulsified beautifully! so please don't be put off if you don't have a high-end or immersion blender!","1508881446","14"
"27531811","sara","Oh my goodness! I want this in my fridge, chilled, and ready at all times. It is so perfect as is. I also like it as a chunkier soup. When I have it as a soup, I add little chunks of tomatoes, avocado, and cucumber but it is simple perfect just following the recipe!","1529433713","14"
"27872275","Maria A. Garces","I have prepared gazpacho many times and also made this version. Spaniards don't use the onion. Most cooks in Spain put 3-4 cloves of garlic. And I would add 1/2 to 3/4 C water. Adding the olive oil in a stream emulsifies the gazpacho. And straining is the great secret for a creamy consistency. I use a French strainer or food mill, the one that has a handle that turns. It gets most of the juices of the vegetables and some pulp too. In any case, this gazpacho without bread is superb!","1531779282","14"
"108181394","Julie Foehrenbach","I've read all the notes and concluded that the recipe is perfect as is. The difference is how long you blend the ingredients -- at least 3 minutes on high before adding olive oil, vinegar etc, and then giving it another minute. The texture is absolutely velvety.  I used to prefer gazpacho with some chunkiness but changed my mind after doing this.  My friend who has lived in Spain off and on for almost 50 years said this was the best gazpacho she's ever tasted.","1595002968","14"
"15849508","Christine","I have made this three times in the past few weeks, and I've passed the recipe along to a half a dozen people, one of whom has made it four times. I love gazpacho and have been making it for years, but now that I've made it using this much olive oil, I'll never go back to my old recipes. What I love about this site the most is that every few months or so, I find a new solid recipe to add to my repertoire (last summer it was Melissa's ice cream base).","1509373594","12"
"23399072","Brett","I added fennel and watermelon as well. Brushed all the ingredients with olive oil, salt and pepper and grilled for a couple minutes per side for a little char. Also added some smoked paprika to the recipe. Incredibly delicious. Had it as a side with skirt steak the first night. The second night we altered it by adding a handful of shelled peas and some feta cheese, and served it with grille halibut. Day 3 I ate the remainder for lunch with peas, cheese and some chopped cukes and green pepper.","1506879507","12"
"27243352","Cat Friedline","I’d add some pretty little micro greens (Whole Foods) & toasted pine nuts to the top, then I’d drizzle a few dots of balsamic on top with evoo.","1527458927","12"
"27900889","Kate M","Took this to a BBQ with a bunch of foodies. They all loved it! Not to worry, I made a double batch and left some at home for me to eat over the next couple days. I have a good blender, so I blended it like crazy and didn't strain so it's a little hardier than the strained version (personal preference). Because of the double batch, I did have to blend in batches and then mixed all together. No problems there. Recommend for all Gazpacho lovers!","1531934545","11"
"18917787","Diego","I am sorry, but gazpacho is a cold bread soup with tomatoes and other vegetables. I am sure that all the gazpacho that you tried in Seville had bread. (just add the bread, about same quantity that tomatoes, wet in water so is easy).","1508877965","10"
"28044532","George DeBaby","Have used red and yellow bell peppers. Not green as they add A very strong, unwanted flavor.","1532887849","10"
"19538632","EW","Also LH, low fat doesn't equal weight loss, new research is showing that fat is important to keeping you full and olive oil is particularly heart healthy. Maybe don't drink the whole quart in a day, but over 3 days? Shouldn't be a problem!","1508881952","9"
"24801072","dede.heath","Read an online article about straining the tomatoes to remove the seeds, which (article said) add bitterness. Bought 750 grams of strained tomatoes, added 1 seeded cuke, 1 red onion, 1 bunch cilantro, 1 jalapeño, 1 orange pepper, 1 garlic clove. Blended all; added water. Put in frigo. Till tomorrow AM . . . In France I bought a litre of ""gazpacho"" (Spanish brand) in a supermarket, drank it every morning, and didn't want to come back to USA.","1510430818","9"
"27241761","Joyce Miller","Suggested by a friend Gina Ganter to make the following alterations: half the onion, and only white onion; add two peaches; peel cucumbers, tomatoes, and peaches. Use food processor or blender to make everything as fine as possible, and do not filter out solids; use less olive oil (like 1/3 cup max), or to taste.","1527444154","9"
"27394291","Nick","This is the gazpacho recipe I return to. Unlike some of the other comments, I find no need to strain it. I like the added texture. It really does remind me of the gazpacho I had in a small city outside of Barcelona.","1528515711","9"
"27946357","Mark D","I've probably made this gazpacho 20 times. It always delivers. Sometimes I've strained it, other times not--using a Vitamix ensures there are no clumps and the last time I prepared it a strainer did not do anything.   How hot the poblano is makes a difference. If it's hot, I would go light on it, especially if the gazpacho will be served one or two days later, by which time the heat of the pepper will have infused it much more.","1532186492","9"
"28474223","Leek","I had leftovers - so I put them in a glass bottle and into the freezer. I wouldn't leave it endlessly, but one week later I thawed it out, whirred it up in the blender, and could not tell the difference. Wonderful!","1536008999","8"
"113356521","Elise","I live in Spain and many cooks, if not most, would add bread to thicken the gazpacho. They wouldn’t add more oil. Day old French bread, sometimes just the center and not the crust. 100 to 150 grams.","1624455645","8"
"119891745","Bruce","I made two versions, one with 2 pounds of fresh tomatoes and the other two pounds of canned tomatoes (weighed after draining.)  Among my blinded tasters, the canned version won. It required two drained 28 oz cans of peeled San Marzano tomatoes to yield two pounds. Otherwise followed the recipe as written with Anaheim peppers, and it has been well received.","1660683451","8"
"15802569","JM","PS - it IS delicious.<br/><br/>Forgot to mention that I leveled the tomatoes before blending. The serrated peeler I got on Flo Fab's recommendation let's me peel tomatoes, peaches, etc. with ease, without boiling water.  If you cook a lot, you need one.","1509373445","7"

"27812697","Sirina","Didn’t strain, and it’s delicious.  I can imagine that it would be different, more delicate, perhaps, if strained, but I liked it a lot unstrained.  And for everyday meals, you get more nutrition without straining.","1531336662","7"
"28029455","Ryguy","The first time I made this, exactly to the recipe, was great. The second time I combined it with Martha Rose Shulman’s Avocado Gazpacho and it was fantastic. The avocado mellows the onion, garlic and salt so I used a little more of each and it was perfect. Straining and chilling are a must and this tastes even better the next day. ","1532735292","7"
"28163951","Adam Gelb","No strain. Add lump crab meat and micro greens. Croutons too. Heaven.","1533761621","7"
"101975046","Michele","After chopping, but before blending, salt the veggies with 1-2 tsp good kosher salt (not Morton's) and let sit for an hour. The acid is neutralized and flavor is transformed.","1565655570","7"
"102312014","david","This recipe is a revelation, especially when tomatoes come in. I evangelize it. I follow this to the letter except i use two cubanelles, and I add the salt to the chopped veg in a bowl to rest about 15 mins before adding to blender, rather than with the sherry.","1567388126","7"
"108495714","Deb","I used the solids after straining - adding to leftover quinoa, cucumber, scallions, mint with oil and vinegar.  A delicious summer salad that I was able to eat while the strained gazpacho was chilling in the fridge.","1596672034","7"
"19438146","Leslie","This is second time I made it - so knew to double the recipe: it goes really fast. Used 2x the garlic and 2T evoo for the doubled recipe. Delicious and healthy!<br/>Thank you Julia and NYT cooking.","1508881715","6"
"24464346","Megan","Before, I'd only known the American red chunky-style gazpacho. This, made with a pile of fresh-off-the-vine heritage tomatoes, and strained as directed, was dreamy delicious. I'm embarrassed to say I used to think I was fancy using Spicy V-8 as the base!","1508116868","6"
"30011495","Stacy Hall","yes yes and yes. I never really likes gazpacho until I made this. Even my finicky spouse approved! Once the summer garden's tomatoes start piling up, this stays as a constant in the fridge.  My first batch, I couldn't locate sherry vinegar ANYwhere, so I used white wine vinegar and added a splash of sherry. I liked it so much I went back to doing it that way on my subsequent batches!

"108181703","Jennifer","This is my favorite gazpacho. Sometimes I leave it unstrained, but it's really magical when the texture is very, very fine.  Best of all, it freezes beautifully!

I  first used my food processor to blend the veggies in 2 batches and then transferred the blended veggies to the blender where they all fit, and added the vinegar and oil. I was skeptical at first because I'm a fan of chunky gazpacho, but this might be my new favorite! It was a big hit at the picnic. I was also thinking that it might make a really good bloody Mary! :-)","1509373493","5"

"27964222","Lorenzo","I find that the addition of thyme and pimenton (smoked paprika) really brightens up the gazpacho.  Just made some for breakfast, fantastic with chopped cucumber and small croutons.  Good sherry vinegar and olive oil are key!","1532362977","5"

"113006369","AnaB","My family comes from Seville, and this similar but not quite the recipe (or flavor) of my family's old recipe.  There is one big interloper: the onion. Never have I ever added onion to a gazpacho.  I am open to try the recipe with cubanelle instead of red bell peppers, but never ever with onion.   I make it with or without bread,  depending on the paleo status of my home, though.","1622042168","5"

"113357927","Heather","this recipe is the BEST!!!   some tips (and one small tweak): * Tasty Toms/Campari tomatoes are great for this since they're nicely sweet/juicy; I've found Romas to often be underripe/mealy * after coring, remove the tomato seeds and put them in a strainer to remove excess juice (to keep the puree thicker); then add the seeds back to the blender. * I sometimes add 4oz of white bread, crusts removed and torn into chunks, it thickens it nicely and adds a little more sweetness.","1624460250","4"

"101603351","jennysorel","Just made this. Managed to fit all ingredients into a blender. (The advantage to using a blender over a Cuisinart is that you can fill it to the top.) I used green/spring onions rather than an onion b/c that’s what I had. The only peppers available in the nearby grocer’s were, I think, finger peppers. They worked fine, not too hot. Otherwise I made as written. To enter into the straining debate, I say strain! It changes the texture of the soup and strains out the cucumber and tomato seeds. Yum!","1563836471","3"

I over-acidulated a bit so it was balanced when served with glugs of really good EVOO and a sprinkle of chives  This stuff is like silk made of tomatoes. Yum!","1624320748","3"

A teaspoon of Old Bay in every batch. Fresh basil and mint, Mexican if you are lucky enough to find it. I have to try this with day old bread soaked in vinegar.","1624446080","3"

"113819162","Larry","This recipe has sustained and delighted me daily through a month of peak tomato season. It’s brilliant as written, but after making about 20 quarts, I’ve found that adding a banana pepper adds a balanced heat that takes it over the top, heightening all the other flavors. In addition, both red and white onions were harsh to my taste, but a sweet yellow onion is perfect. Smooth gazpacho freezes perfectly, so if you have abundant tomatoes, make as much as your freezer will hold.","1627325309","3"

Red wine vinegar works great, but only needed one tbs. Blend until smooth with garlic and an Anaheim pepper.

By the way, this is not a very good recipe for gazpacho. It is missing the essential ingredient of soaked bread, there are no almonds, or enough garlic.","1689684071","3"

I chop up the biggest parts for a few seconds to make room, then it add the rest.  Let it run for 4 or 5 minutes, adding the vinegar and oil through the feed tube toward the end, and you are done.

I used all red tomatoes and it ended up an unappealing pale salmon color. I dislike the bitter taste of raw onion so only used a small shallot. Perhaps that bitterness will be gone after it has chilled in the tomato puree overnight. My favorite gazpacho uses a can o tomatoes, half a mild onion, a whole English cucumber, a large roasted red pepper from a jar, red wine vinegar, olive oil.","1688008809","2"
"126059109","Amelia Jayne","I put some finely chopped cucumber and tomato at the bottom of the bowls before pour the soup.  It gives a little texture without thinning the rich flavor.","1688231302","2"
"126072415","Patrice","I used two pounds of Campari tomatoes from Trader Joe's as these are tasty year round.  I followed the recipe with exception of using rice vinegar and not straining at the end. The flavor is unbelievable!  Sipping this on a hot day will transport me to Seville.  The surprise is how amazing this is without the bread.","1688317001","2"
"126075648","JF","Delicious. I've made it now at least a dozen times. Note that the recipe calls for a ""small mild onion"", and the one time it turned out not-so-great I think the onion was either too big or too strong.","1688328230","2"
"126111736","Bill","I have traveled extensively in Spain, including Seville, and even though I had gazpacho at least once a day I never encountered this version.  On the other hand, when I was in Spain I never had gazpacho exactly the same twice since gazpacho is traditionally made from ingredients on hand at the moment, and therefore varies from day to day and cook to cook.  This version tastes more like V-8 or tomato juice without the sherry vinegar.","1688481675","2"
"126224362","Joe","Had gazpacho in Spain every single day, fell in love with it (even just out of a package from the grocery store there). Tried to find something comparable when I got home, never could, even online.   THIS is the gazpacho I remember. It's perfect.   Use half the cucumber skins. I don't strain -- I love it thick and chunky. Use Campari tomatoes -- perfect for it.","1689001704","2"
"126224560","Casey","I have made this several times a season for many years now, and have served it at numerous dinner parties. It is always a hit. I have made it strained and unstrained. They are different experiences, but both are fantastic. The cubanelle pepper is a must.","1689002165","2"
"126225267","Jodi Wer","I'm the outlier; I like my gazpacho chunky. In Spain, if they didn't already serve chopped veggies to add (many places did), I would ask for them. At home, I don't even blend. I also add cilantro and red bell pepper.","1689003773","2"

"126226637","CG","What a grease bomb!   The large quantity of oil certainly did not make delicious gazpacho.  Rather, it took the scrumptious flavors of fresh seasonal vegetables and dulled them past the point of recognition.    This is a better recipe for making gazpacho at a time when all you have is canned or out-of-season vegetables shipped in from the other side of the globe, and you need a large amount of quality extra-virgin oil just to make them taste like something that resembles food.","1689006535","2"
"126230958","David Maxfield","This is a fine recipe.  But two suggestions.  Quality canned tomatoes (with basel, garlic) works very well, and one can of consomme adds je ne c'est pas. DMM","1689016792","2"
"126232382","david","i made the Persian tomato, cucumber and onion salad featured recently in these pages last week. after a couple of days the leftover salad got watery so i pureed it, quickly scalded it and added some tomato juice and tabasco. i worked in a restaurant where we made gazpacho in a similar fashion. very refreshing. but one night the cook at the cold station served a bowl of cocktail sauce instead of the gazpacho. now that was funny.","1689020369","2"
"126239257","Jane","I made this half a dozen times last summer. Can't wait to make it again, just waiting for tomatoes to come in good and ripe. I blanch & peel the tomatoes then use an immersion blender. No straining needed. It's perfection.","1689044053","2"
"126256124","P. Funder","This is my favorite recipe for ripe summer tomatoes.  I do not strain it.  I enjoy the texture.","1689108788","2"
"126265721","Heather","I absolutely ADORE this recipe. I've made two tweaks over the years that (at least I think) make it even better: 1) I put the chopped tomatoes in a colander over a bowl to let the watery juice come out before whizzing it in the blender; I don't like how the water separates out in the fridge and I like the soup just a little thicker anyway; 2) I add 4 ounces of white bread, crusts removed--it thickens it a little more. #2 is optional but I like the touch of sweetness and body that it adds.","1689169986","2"
"126293569","Lauren Z","Made this today and it is delightful - fresh and a perfect way to use summer's bounty. It must be chilled for at least a few hours. It tastes good initially but the complexity comes from chilling the mixture together. I used half as much oil and still thought it was too much; and the onion was too pronounced - I would switch to a shallot or only a quarter sweet onion next time. Agree with another comment on leaving on half of the cucumber skins.","1689262218","2"
"126340271","Lisa","I've made this several times and I'm in agreement with the non-strainers: if you have a strong blender, all of the skins and seeds blend down into a nice purée that's just the right thickness for our tastes, no straining necessary. I like to serve this with a couple of croutons on top and a drizzle of olive oil.","1689439514","2"

"127128195","Patti","Have made this many times and I love it. This time I had watermelon to use up. After looking at other recipes for watermelon gazpacho but remaining skeptical, I opted for this tried-and-true recipe and just used 1/2 watermelon and 1/2 tomatoes. Such a nice result, I may just make it this way all the time. Can't taste the watermelon, but thinking it may add a touch of sweetness to help the flavor of the tomatoes.","1692399790","2"

Furthermore, there's nothing more disgusting than oil in gazpacho.  If people want to add oil to their serving or season it, that's their choice.","1713799731","2"

"134003072","Harbor Diner","Isn't hard to follow a recipe for gazpacho?!  Subbed red pepper for the cubanelle, and scallions for the onion. After reading a few other recipes and the comments, I decided I wanted to use bread (half an old bagel) and did not want to strain.  Made the mistake of 2 garlic cloves and it was really sharp so I served it with cubed cukes and cilantro to cut the bite.","1718808809","2"
"134036202","Jeff B","We make this often, all summer. If you blanch tomatoes and peel the skins, de-seed the tomatoes and cucumber, I find no need to strain it. Peeling the tomato skins is really key for the texture. I prefer only half a clove raw garlic, as to not overpower the other flavors. And if you have good Spanish sherry vinegar from Jerez, be bold with the vinegar and salt... it is so delicious.","1718915581","2"
"134080447","Heather","Too salty! I cut the recommended salt by close to half and it was still too much. Otherwise, it's delicious.","1719092689","2"
"134080515","KA","I just made this. I didn’t understand why to strain I love a nice thick purée gazpacho. Then I realized I didn’t love the thickness so why not try straining half of it and see what it is like? LOVED IT. Strain it.","1719093121","2"

"134132588","Southern Spaniard","This is a travesty, local southern spaniard here, Gazpacho means a soup made with bread. The common gazpacho is this recipe and BREAD.

"134137904","Vera","The picture above looks like Campbell's Cream of Tomato Soup. Not my idea of gazpacho, especially with that swamp of oil on it. And why strain it? You lose the nutrients and fiber.   My gazpacho takes five minutes. Cucumber. Onion. Tomato, Garlic. Splash of rice wine vinegar. Small can of V-8. Tabasco if desired. Slice up the vegetables and throw them in the food processor. Add remaining ingredients and blend to desired consistency (I like mine evenly chunky). Very digestible.","1719340395","2"
"134478524","David H","No need to strain, but I did blend for a long time: at least 3 min at hi speed.  I added 2 slices of white bread, which gave it some body and a bit of texture.  Used 1/3 c oil, not ½ . Just fine.","1720401949","2"
