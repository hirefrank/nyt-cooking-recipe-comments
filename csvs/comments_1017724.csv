"16988985","Kris","A couple of things...<br/>1. Since Hasselback is called out here, acknowledgement to our friends in Sweden @ the Hasselback Hotel are in order. Legend has it this dish was invented there.<br/>2. A lot of time can be saved arranging potatoes on their ends by taking a nice Yukon Gold, placing it in a wooden spoon (the spoony-end) and slicing till your knife hits the spoon. The tater stays together nicely at the bottom and it's very easy to handle. You can google this.","1509378270","1209"
"25335091","Lorna","It’s fine you don’t like this kind of recipe but it’s not necessary to tell us what you made instead. These notes are to help people with the recipe. We don’t need to know about you. Go ahead and have a peanut butter sandwich. Or a slice of pizza. Just don’t write us notes about it please.","1514181484","891"
"16872166","Kate C","Excellent! Added a grated onion to the liquid/cheese mix for flavor. Made it through first 2 thirty minute bakings in advance. Then covered and chilled. Brought to the dinner, sprinkled cheese on top and did final baking of about 40 minutes at the meal (removed foil half way through.) Texture was great! I was worried because initially liquid barely covered bottom of pan, but juices came out with baking and it was perfect! Good crusty bits on bottom too. A real keeper of a recipe.","1509378665","755"
"21520402","John A.","I've read reference here to soaking the potatoes in water before making the dish- as a shortcut or ""timesaver"" I suppose- even from a food editor at the Times.  Big mistake. Any of these gratin Dauphinois kind of potato dishes (sliced potatoes baked in cream) need the natural starch of the potato mixed with the cream to thicken it, not to mention the flavor of the potato. Soaking the sliced potatoes washes starch & flavor away and reduces the quality of the finished dish.","1508865966","704"
"25185954","J Hoppe","I made this dish for Thanksgiving with sweet potatoes (not yams) to wild success. My family practically hoisted me upon their shoulders. When I called my mother a week later, she answered the phone without a hello: ""Those sweet potatoes were the best thing I've ever eaten."" I said, ""Hi, Mom. How's everything?"" She said, ""God, those sweet potatoes were good."" I give my full throated endorsement for this recipe. It can make you feel like a conquering hero.","1513013161","533"
"16275257","Lee","We made this with sweet potatoes instead of russets, and it was absolutely amazing. Very delicious (both savory and sweet), and exactly as you promised: creamy potato and crusty cheesy edge in every bite. It was transcendent.","1509375777","415"
"17020594","recox","I would say it serves 6, but it depends on what else you are serving. I made a double batch in an 11x13 pan and it was about 12 one-cup servings. My guests fell on it like starving wolves and ate every scrap, so you should probably err on the side of too much rather than too little. It is THAT delicious. <br/><br/>Since my dish was rectangular I put the slices in rows. There was a gap along the edge of the pan, so I pushed the rows together more tightly to make room for another full row.","1509378304","266"
"16984055","Rita","OK. Russets? Really?  The best potato for a recipe like this is an Eastern white like Long Island White or Maine Katahdin. Sorry. A potato snob since we grow them and are knowledgeable about the characteristics of the MANY different varieties.","1509378713","213"
"102299638","christine Andrews","I made these in cupcake tins. Extra crispy and a nice serving size.","1567282033","208"
"16405298","Jerry","Great recipe!  I've made it twice with great success.  I used somewhat more cheese than called for because I like rich, creamy dishes.  I didn't peel the potatoes on the second try because my daughter insisted that the peel has all the nutrients.  It was just as good.   It's helpful to choose potatoes of equal size.","1509375950","189"
"16984481","Mona","I agree. No Russets but Yukon Gold Potatoes are the Best for this","1509379112","176"
"17130977","Pat","I made this for Christmas, and it was amazing! Came out looking just like the photo. Potatoes were cheesy and soft on the bottom and crusty brown on top. I used 6 ounces of Gruyere cheese, and half and half instead of the heavy cream. It was so good, and got such rave reviews, that it will be a permanent part of our holiday fare from now on, and I'll definitely make it for guests throughout the year too!","1508868489","147"
"16268286","kate","Oops. Did not read carefully...now I see there are three 30 minute segments. I did have to give it 'extra' time to brown it but the potatoes were still a bit too firm. Great flavor and I will make it correctly next time. I was glad to have help in the kitchen-it's a lot of prep work and the cream was flying when I was placing the creamy potato stacks in the dish. Also, recommend placing the casserole on a baking sheet in the oven.","1509376274","141"
"16275772","Arianna","Delicious - and very very rich.  I made a half recipe in an 8x8 Pyrex baking dish; I had very little excess liquid, but the dish is still moist.  Pay attention to the note to season generously - I used maybe a teaspoon of salt, and it's definitely not enough.","1509375632","137"
"16274559","Sam","Soaked cut potatoes for 1 hour in cold water. Doubled cheese (which I grated fresh),  Added 1t dried mustard, 1/2 cup diced onions sautéed brown in butter, 1T black pepper and 1T salt to mix before tossing potatoes and putting in dish. Baking takes 50 minutes (done at 400 covered/420 uncovered). Excellent!","1509375651","136"
"17060231","Emily Weinstein, Cooking Editor","You can slice the potatoes several hours in advance; keep them submerged in cold water until you're ready to assemble the dish.","1509378200","118"
"22237776","Scott","Used Yukon Gold potatoes and left the skins on.  Looked great.  Added 1T Dijon mustard and 1.5 tsp smoked paprika as someone else here had suggested. Definitely improved the flavor over the original recipe (which we'd tasted in the past).  Also doubled the cheese--my wife says it's the staff of life.  Who am I to argue.","1506865883","99"
"24715187","Baker Dad","Place a chopstick along both long sides of the potato and slice down until your knife touches the chopsticks. This makes handling the potatoes infinitely easier.","1509826623","95"
"16370417","Tim Murtaugh","This is great stuff. My one recommendation: although the cheesy sauce looks too good to waste, don't succumb to the temptation to add it all. You need that breathing room for the potatoes to brown sufficiently.<br/><br/>I mean, it will still be delicious with 50% less browsed surface, but why risk it.","1509375602","76"
"16608197","Lorry Kennedy","I love the skins, so left them on... Was great, a little more crispy","1509377091","63"
"16265951","Hayford Peirce","Beets?  Quelle horreur!","1509375503","61"
"16334708","TriciaPDX","Try a cup of cream and a half cup or so of chicken stock.  It will thin the cream but not so much that the potatoes won't be well coated.  Use more stock to bring the liquid level to halfway up the casserole walls.<br/><br/>You need cream for the rich flavor.  Whole milk won't taste the same.  Still, it would probably be absolutely delicious even with milk.","1509375896","61"
"16397234","Ellen B.","Well, this recipe lives up to it's rep and it's positive reviews.  It is both a beautiful presentation dish and delicious tasting.  I added more cream as the amount in the recipe didn't seem enough, probably increased the cream by about 1/3.  <br/><br/>The recipe is a bit deceiving however, it has the appearance of something that you slave over for hours but other than the labor of thinly slicing the potatoes, which I did manually, it's quite easy.  Pretty and delicious enough for special occasions!","1509376030","57"
"16266529","MAS","I'm thinking thin sliced onion would make a nice addition, interspersed with the potato slices.","1509375687","52"
"16401081","Pat","You can buy cut-proof metal laced kitchen gloves for $10; well worth it.","1509375492","50"
"20542741","M A","This is delicious and was a big hit at a pre-Thanksgiving pot luck buffet.  Next time I make it, I will reserve about a cup of the cream mixture and add it to the gratin during the last part of baking for extra creaminess and moisture.<br/><br/>For those who don't have a mandoline due to the cost, look for a Japanese mandoline.  Professional chefs use them because of their durability, ease of use, and low cost.  One brand name is Benriner.  I used mine to slice the potatoes in about 3 minutes.","1508888054","49"
"16265884","Karin Byars","Yuck! Beets would ruin  this perfect creation.","1509375993","48"
"16340481","Chef Carlos","Crunchy, cheesy potatoey heaven.  Wonderful recipe, worked perfectly, just stuff all those taters in there to stand up like little soldiers and you're on your way.","1509376248","46"
"16790962","Kathryn","Baking ahead worked and did not affect the texture at all. The potatoes stayed quite firm in the casserole after the final 30 minute baking. I took the casserole out of fridge ahead of cooking.","1509376731","46"
"20575506","From Comments","Increase Gruyere<br/>Add sherry<br/>Use Yukon Gold potatoes, not russet<br/>Can substitute sweet potatoes","1508887440","46"
"29940963","C&amp;R","I followed advice from several commenters -- I used lots of salt, extra garlic, added a bit of smoked paprika (yum), and increased the cooking time by 30 minutes (45 minutes covered, 45 minutes uncovered, 30 minutes with additional cheese). It was marvelous -- perfectly cooked and not bland. The leftovers, which I admit I was surprised we had, were terrific the next day reheated in the oven covered with foil. Making them again for NYE.","1546215500","41"
"24963547","Ms. D","I've now par-cooked this slightly in advance a few times.  I do the first two rounds of cooking in the morning and the last immediately before serving:  1. cook for *35* minutes, covered, at 400 2. cook for 30 minutes, uncovered, at 400 3. cool until lukewarm and then cover so it doesn't dry out 4. immediately before serving, cook for 30 minutes, with topping cheeses added, 15 minutes at 400 and 15 minutes at 350 (I do this so I can cook the biscuits with it without burning them)","1511668705","40"
"17257146","Garrett","Added some sherry in substitution for a corresponding amount of cream. Adds a slightly sweet balance and complexity. Will add some sage next time. With 3 pounds of potatoes it was undercooked by about 15 min. But really good.","1508867388","39"
"16370378","Tim Murtaugh","Because raw potatoes discolor rapidly, I think the only thing you could do ahead of time is assemble the cream sauce, which doesn't save much time.<br/><br/>However (this is just a slightly-educated guess), I bet you could follow the recipe through the second 30-minute bout in the oven, then stop. At this point you could take it out, cover, and store.<br/><br/>To finish, the called for final 30 minutes won't cut it, I don't think, since it will have to be brought back up to temperature, so add some extra time.","1509376277","37"
"16795679","Vyga","To prevent potatoes from browning, add a teeny bit of ascorbic acid powder to the water holding peeled potatoes. Or citric acid.....a half of a vitamin C tablet.","1509377717","37"
"17956218","Scott","Sherry is FANTASTIC addition to heavy cream sauces. Would have overlooked this in this particular recipe. THANKS!","1508872596","37"
"16932169","JCo","Favorite dish of Thanksgiving. I used an apple peeler which peeled and gave a perfect spiral cut, instead of using the mandolin. Great time saver.","1509378222","34"
"17050838","Jessie Keating","For those who don't want to use all that heavy cream, I substituted cashew cream (2 cups raw unsalted cashews, cover with water, blend until creamy). It's MUCH easier on the stomach, and healthier too!","1509378284","33"
"29862343","isotopia","I'm gonna be the recipe heretic and admit to covering the top of the dish with crumbled bacon along with the remaining cheese.","1545529328","33"
"110344158","KM","The reason for the broken sauce might be the high fat content of the heavy cream and cheese combined with the high oven temp.  When I made this, instead of doing it as written, I made a roux with butter and flour, whisked in whole milk, then stirred in the cheese.  The roux helps emulsify everything into a smooth creamy sauce.  It's a little bit more work, but the result was beautiful!","1606498566","32"
"16266621","Marjorie Och","This was good, but not as wonderful as a traditional rich potato gratin or traditional Hasselback potatoes. Nutmeg is needed here...but I love nutmeg. I might try this again. This is definitely worth experimenting with.","1509376097","30"
"20298536","Tasty potatoes","Made half recipe in 8x8  Pyrex glass casserole.  Mistakenly added all cheeses to cream and it was still excellent.  Roasted for 1 1/2 hours at 400 and had delicious crispy crust.  Served 8.  My potatoes were hand sliced and used Yukon gold and even though they were not uniform in size they still were delicious.","1508885512","29"
"16336158","Christine","Just be careful when using your fingers near the end of the potato.  Make sure you use the plastic pusher to protect them.   I'm now sadder, but wiser.   :-)","1509376176","28"
"16797666","skip","i made this for thanksgiving with a variation of using sweet potatoes.  once i had everything ready to go in the oven the casserole dish looked a little low on liquid (not up to halfway mark, so i added some buttermilk instead of more cream; the results were marvelous, high marks from around the table of very picky foodies.","1509377369","28"
"17772570","Spendthrift","I LOVE THIS DISH. We've made it three times and each time it comes out wonderfully. It's the only reason I will drag out my clunky mandoline, which is essential as I can't cut potatoes thinly and consistently enough by hand. We've only used Yukon Gold and have no complaint. It DOES INDEED take an hour and a half.","1508871582","27"
"16268009","Linda","The end product of this recipe is wonderful. However, note that the recipe calls for already-sliced potatoes and for already-grated cheese.  These all take time that I don't think is adequately factored into the time estimate.  Maybe the recipe writer had a slicing/grating elf for the prep work.   I have made it twice so far and will probably make it again.","1509376225","22"
"17010533","Jill","Made this last night as my husband and guests watched me ""massage the rich cheesy goodness all over those spuds."" Only the tops tasted like they held the sauce.  Maybe I shouldn't have packed them in so tightly (per the recipe); I was disappointed that more of the sauce didn't cover more of the potato slices, after all my massaging.  Maybe my onlookers were jealous they weren't getting special treatment!  Also used the Cuisinart on #4 to slice potatoes.  Success!","1509379111","22"
"16345156","C. C.","I made the mistake of using regular whipping cream vs. heavy cream, and the result was oily instead of creamy. And I'll add more cheese next time. Otherwise, it was a pretty and tasty dish, perfectly cooked with only 20 mins at the end. Leftovers were good for breakfast.","1509376232","20"
"17251546","Beth","This took a LOT longer than the stated baking time....probably at least 45 minutes longer.  The exposed tops cooked much faster than the lower, packed-together-in-the-pan (per the recipe's instructions) halves..... By the time the tops were cooked, the bottoms were still pretty much raw....","1508867491","20"
"16771803","Kathleen","I'd like to try this for just the two of us--and that would mean only two potatoes, for dietary reasons. Which seems like a lot of work.<br/><br/>So I'm wondering about doing the whole recipe, and freezing portions of it after the first meal?<br/><br/>Any feedback most welcome.<br/><br/>And Happy Thanksgiving to all you folks down there who celebrate in the wrong month!   ;-)","1509376804","19"
"16266618","Hayford Peirce","Probably couldn't hurt, but would be another layer of complexity when putting the dish together.  And would probably change the taste rather significantly....","1509376119","18"
"16349797","Chris","Milk worked fine for me. I never use cream in quiches, gratins, etc. If I want some richness that milk normally doesn't provide, I simmer it for awhile to reduce it and caramelize the sugars a bit. Yum.","1509375436","18"
"16275779","Arianna","I was able to slice four potatoes in just a couple of minutes with a mandoline.  I can't recommend that tool highly enough - there are really great ones available for $40 on Amazon, and it will cut your prep time immensely.  I'm sure a slicing disc on a food processor would work well too.","1509375961","16"
"16997911","Rich","Some have commented that the sauce is bland. Obviously, it's important to use a strongly flavored, mature Gruyere.  I'm wondering if subbing in some buttermilk our sour cream would perk it up?","1509378827","16"
"111338979","Sofi","Made this once as written with russets and it was delicious - they soaked up the cream at the bottom and were soft and fabulous, and crispy at the top. Another time with Yukons and they were not done after the directed cooking time, and just swam in the cream. Probably with some modifications it can work well, but if doing as written, go with russets.","1611968864","16"
"16759120","Emily Weinstein","We recommend making this dish the day you plan to serve it; potato dishes tend not to do well in the refrigerator, where they get heavy and gluey, and may discolor. If you want to make potatoes ahead, try this recipe for mashed potato casserole, which is an exception to the do-not-refrigerate-potatoes rule. The potatoes are mashed with sour cream, and so while they are dense (rather than fluffy), they are also creamy and smooth: <a href=""http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013923-mashed-potato-casserole"" title=""http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013923-mashed-potato-casserole"" target=""_blank"">http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013923-mashed-potato-casserole</a>","1509377295","15"
"24941850","Dana Brown","Once you've slice the potatoes I advise going ahead, damn the torpedos, full to the finish per cooking instructions. I refrigerated the assembled gratin overnight and the exposed potatoes turned an unsightly black color.","1511468013","15"
"108219628","Audrey","We've been playing around with this recipe for a while now, and we've come up with some additions we really like:  1. We increased the Gruyere from 3 oz. to 4 oz., divided between the sauce and the topping.  2. We added 1/2 cup of grated cheddar to the top of the casserole during the final baking period. Nice caramelization!  3. We added about a teaspoon of smoked paprika to the sauce (this dish LOVES smoked paprika!)  4. We've added a little ground rosemary to the topping.","1595217546","15"
"24794000","AKC","I made this with Asiago and oregano (what I had on hand). Divine. There wasn’t a scrap left.   Advice of note: don’t rinse or soak your potatoes, coat the dish heavily with butter ( you could tell there was potential for a real mess), and don’t use all the cream (I failed to get a good amount of crisp because the fluid was too high). ","1510354620","14"
"17093914","Sabebelle","I replaced the gruyère with ""cantal""  cheese, readily available here in France and a great deal more savory than the initial recipe. Other than that, an excellent recipe that got rave reviews.","1508868678","13"
"29595678","Mary Lynott","This is delicious. Good to note that it takes 90 minutes baking in the oven. Next time I will bake for the first 60 minutes ahead of time, chill it, and when ready to serve it for a meal, put in the oven for the last 30 to 40 minutes. Cover with foil for the first 20 minutes. Will also try half and half instead of the cream.  ","1543778356","13"
"16268108","tal","Agree with Linda, this is a time consuming version of this recipe.  There are a number of hasselback recipes on the web that are quicker.  That said, this recipe coats all the slices nicely with the cheese mixture which other recipes don't do as well.  This recipe would be good for special occasions and/or holidays.  I am adding to the Thankgiving menu this year.","1509375784","12"
"16390116","Dorian McCready","Don't be scared to add more cheese.  I skimped and regret it.  <br/><br/>And ensure you don't overfill!  <br/><br/>Great dish.","1509376153","12"
"16704916","LittleLambi","Whoever recommended using sweet potato instead of russet potato was genius!  We made both and much preferred the sweet potato version.  We did not have enough cream mixture to pour over to make it come up halfway, but it worked out OK.","1509377759","12"
"29010929","ann-c berglund","believe the original recipe is called ""hasselbackspotatis"". swedish. Hasselbacken is an ancient and well-known restaurant at Stockholm's plein air zoo and cultural museum, Skansen. learned tocook it in senior high in the 1950s. potatoes oval, peeled and ""slit"" superthinly (like a breadloaf) ALMOST to the bottom(potato still hangs together). in the original no cream, but LOADS of melted butter/lots of grated cheeze. yumyum.","1539558484","12"
"17029992","Maria","Can any steps be made ahead of time?  Not sure I can dedicate 1 1/2 hrs oven time on Christmas - but everyone is clamoring for this.","1509378149","11"
"20022522","Priya","Make sure to add in enough salt - maybe 2 tsp in order to get enough flavor and also to serve with enough of the cheesy sauce.","1508885579","11"
"29894151","Nick","You do realize that potatoes came from the Americas?","1545787093","11"
"16319395","Marge","Sounds good for a potluck but would need to make it ahead of time.  What's the shelf life?","1509375908","10"
"17446479","VinceGraceFood","Oh..... my..... gerd.....","1508870537","10"
"20542764","M A","I made it through the second baking round the day before a party.  Took it out of the fridge in the morning and finished baking before we left for the hosts' home, then re-warmed it in their oven before dining.  Worked great.  Just don't cover it with plastic after it's finished: use a towel.","1508887763","10"
"20639206","Jonathan","Outlier result. Could be the high sided casserole dish I chose; could be the convection oven I had available. In any case, here's what i got when I served it: the cheese had curdled out of the liquid; the bottoms of the potatoes were undercooked and the tops were almost like crisps; and the flavor was very mild, almost too milky. Put it back in the oven at slightly lower temp and it cooked through.  Very supportive diners that night.","1508887629","10"
"21603464","jim","I made this once with the heavy cream and once with a béchamel (or mornay) sauce. The mornay substitute was more popular with my diners. Either way, I think this is a very good recipe and I immediately went out and bought López-Alt's book.","1508866046","10"
"29516938","Lindsey","These were delicious. My husband said, ""Oh my god. I love you. These are so good,"" while he was eating them. I think that comment is up there in the top comments I've gotten for my food. I used Yukon Gold potatoes but followed the recipe otherwise. Someone said 1 tsp of salt was not nearly enough so I used close to 2 teaspoons and it was on the brink of too salty, but everyone still loved them. I also sliced my finger pretty deeply on the mandoline, so be careful yall.","1543208273","10"
"29894596","Ea","On the note about the gruyere being bland: I made batches on successive weekends for two different holiday dinners. I have to say, the first batch I could only get my hands on a “cave aged” gruyere, which had a texture closer to the parmesan.  Those potatoes were amazing and didn’t need much salt.   Second batch was a softer, less aged gruyere and the results were noticeably less flavorful. Still tasty, but the mature cheese was remarkable. Worth the investment. ","1545796080","10"
"16288033","Wordsworth from Wadsworth","My lady friend and I are over 60.  The two cups of heavy cream sound fulsomely rich at any age.   I seek a substitute.   I was thinking of whole milk thickened with a modicum of cornstarch or arrowroot.  Bechamel I would gainsay also.   Any suggestions for the gall bladder impaired crowd?","1509375674","9"
"23580952","AAS","Tried it with gruyere and thyme but didn't go over as well as when I subbed asiago and oregano, with the parm. That was a hit with my brunch crowd!","1506879950","9"
"29455556","Bob","I have made this recipe a few times and it always takes MUCH longer than the specified time - 1 hour covered, at least 45 minutes to an hour uncovered, so plan accordingly or parcook the potatoes before. Have made it as specified and a ""lighter"" version with milk (it doesn't separate like the cream) and a touch of Parmesan, not for caloric reasons because I used what I had on hand. Other than cooking time, it's a delicious recipe and a nice change from standard dauphinois","1542646051","9"
"17095510","Daniel","Very nice.   I used red potatoes and cheddar only, and substituted a cup of milk for half of the cream, because that's what I had on hand, and it came out fine.   Also, because I'd used a hand grater on the cheddar and it was a little stringy, I used an immersion blender on the sauce, which I think was a good move.","1508867587","8"
"20215138","Marina MacNamara","Delicious! Didn't take too much time, especially with a mandolin to help slice the potatoes - even with arranging them vertically. Of note, I used yukon gold potatoes, and the gruyere-cheddar mix from Trader Joe's - still delicious!","1508886122","8"
"23789992","Beth","I made them again, and this time did a better job following the instructions. Since I was making it for 2 people, I used a mini loaf pan and 3-4 smallish russet potatoes. After removing it, I let it sit and it wasn't greasy; maybe it was absorbed into the potatoes. I covered it for 30 min, then uncovered for 30 min, then added cheese and cooked ~20 min. Success. I hand sliced the potatoes since it was for two it worked OK. If it were for a crowd, I would use my food processor.","1506882870","8"

"17045338","Phyllis","Outstanding! At the last minute on Christmas Eve I found that I was to cook Christmas Dinner as the original hostess was ill. I ran to the store - and Christmas Day tossed in the turkey and sliced up the potatoes - Easy-peasy and the best dinner ever with coconut carrots and impromptu dessert. The potatoes were a dream - couldn't find gruyere so substituted Baby Swiss -","1509378429","7"

"19166303","Montana Mary","This recipe is a keeper--unlike lots of scalloped potatoe dishes, this one has crunch, flavor, presents well and I expect will re-heat well for breakfast. We had some Boar's Head ham on hand and added that for extra flavor plus some random bits of smoked gouda. Laying the slices on their sides really worked. Fresh herbs helped with flavor.","1508880608","7"
"29421228","robert","The potato is one of the most delicious products one can have. The problem is the North American potato. I have never tasted a good potato on this continent until I started to grow my own in healthy soil and with natural soil enrichments every year. I use European seed potatoes. I keep wondering how North American farmers manage to grow such a poor product engeneerd to death from dead soil cicked up with chemicals.","1542334397","7"
"106475726","Lindsey","I made this while on Quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic which means I had to utilize the ingredients I had in my house. I heated up my Oat Milk with sharp cheddar, white cheddar, & fresh parmesan with nutmeg, salt & fresh cracked pepper. I recommend melting the cheese in the milk before tossing the potatoes in it- this is basic distribution of ingredients that we learn at culinary school/ industry . I used a round 9"" round pie pan,formed the potatoes into a flower starting from the outside.","1586906686","7"

"20607927","Kim","This dish looked great, but I didn't think it was as great as many here did.  Granted I did use half-n-half and chicken stock instead of heavy cream, but added more cheese than the recipe called for.  It was easy enough to make though, so I would maybe do it again and add some leeks and/or ham or bacon as some have suggested.  It was better reheated the next day.  It did take longer to cook than the 1.5 hours in the recipe.","1508886863","5"

"29501930","Jen","It looked beautiful! Just like the picture. And the crispy, cheesy tops blew me away. Unfortunately the bottom half of the dish was pretty bland. Salt helped, but it’s a lot of work for bland potatoes. Some bacon crumbles might be great addition. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ","1543024716","5"
"29782174","Gabby","As someone who is also allergic to garlic, that's a great idea! I'm about to make this recipe for the second time and plan on adding 2 tbsp Grey Poupon to it, since simply omitting garlic the first time left something to be desired. Make sure your Dijon doesn't have garlic in it, though—I'm okay with trace amounts, so check with your guest.","1545078245","5"
"128940889","Cynthia","This was a showstopper! After reading many of the reviews regarding partially or uncooked potatoes in the final dish, decided to “par cook” in the microwave on high, uncovered for 20 minutes after assembling. Following that the dish went into the fridge after it cooled until about an hour before my guests arrived. Then after coming back to room temp. went into a 400 degree oven, foil covered, for 30 minutes, then 10 minutes foil removed and topped with remaining cheese—Delicious!","1699111414","5"

The family raved about the dish and it’s now on the list of favorites! We also have discovered Japanese sweet potatoes, which have a white flesh and more subtle flavor than the traditional sweet potatoes and work very well in this recipe while adding more nutritional value. In case that matters to anyone at Thanksgiving! Ha!","1700570319","5"

The potatoes were flavorful, came out looking exactly like the photo, and were perfect for our Christmas dinner. <br/><br/>The prep is a wee bit labor intensive (active prep was at least 30 min, as I don't have a mandoline and grated the cheese by hand), but none of the steps were difficult. And it was so worth it. The results were, in my dad's words, ""out of this world!""","1509378469","4"

The first time I also interrupted the final bake and finished it just before the meal. The second time, I followed the recipe to the letter and took it hot to my sister's for Christmas Eve. Once again, both versions were very, very good. This recipe is definitely one I will make again. It also makes a great presentation at the table.","1508868621","4"

"25001527","Penelope","I made this with only aged cheddar since it was all I had on hand and it was delicious. The cream mixture really needs a lot of salt - it tasted very salty to me before I poured it over the potatoes but the finished dish still needed an extra sprinkling. I think this is probably why some commenters find the dish unappetizing.","1511944341","4"

The sauce breaks (becomes grainy and greasy) after it comes out of the oven. 2. The potatoes are undercooked at the times given. 3. It is straight-up bland. The crispy bits on top are ok, but everything else, nope. This recipe has 5 star average over 6000 ratings.

I was feeding 24 and had some celeriac and turnip in the fridge (the end of my winter farm share) so added those to the doubled recipe.   I baked it in my mother’s 72 year old le creuset casserole dish, just as specified and it came out perfect! Not one potato leftover and everyone raved about it.","1681052629","4"
"128335005","CLC","I think I may have been mistaken when I assumed that the entire two tablespoons of butter in the ingredients list were meant to be smeared into the baking dish to butter it, as directed. The finished result tasted good but there was a 1/8” lake of melted butter remaining in the bottom of the pan when the potatoes were served which looked very accidental.","1696904985","4"

"20379338","Beth","I was rushing. I'm a little stressed over the election & not at my best. I forgot to add the cheeses after the potatoes were neatly arranged.  Dumped them back in the bowl, mixed them with the cheese, and rearranged them a little less neatly.  Then I started to wonder when I was supposed to put in the salt and pepper and looked more closely - oops.  Out came the potatoes again, salt & pepper added, arranged semi-randomly, and all was well.  They were good just not so beautiful.","1508887284","3"

I no longer welcome canned soups into my life, so this recipe is a welcome find for me. I made it with goat milk instead of cream, and the result is super savory and tasty. I’ll definitely be making it again, with different cheeses and maybe a combination of cream and goat milk for a little more of a saucy result. Delicious!","1575143955","3"

Next time I will up it to 1/2 tsp.","1668354036","3"
"121677507","Hannah","EPIC FAIL!! I’ve never had a dish turn so wrong in such a spectacularly public fashion. I cooked the first two steps the day before Thanksgiving. Pulled out the dish the day of, let it come to room temp only to discover that it was not cooked all the way through, so exposed potatoes had turned black. It then took TWO HOURS in the oven and most potatoes were still the consistency of apple slices. My guests were charitable and kind, but it was awful. Next year? Good old fashioned mashed potatoes!","1669420700","3"
"122328759","Christopher","This was gravely disappointing.    The liquid thickened while I was dipping the slices, and I ran out.  I added more cream to finish up the dipping.  Then the ""liquid"" loosened up when it went into the oven, and mostly submerged the vertical slices so I had almost no crunchy layer at all.  Also, oils from the cheese separated during baking, leaving a greasy oil slick at the bottom of the pan.    This was marginally better as leftovers.","1672657412","3"
"122625996","cara","meh. this was kind of a lot of effort to be not as delicious as i was hoping for. the recipe needs to specify how much salt. i used about 3/4 TBS and this was nowhere near enough. could have doubled the amount of cheese. and definitely do not need 2 TBS of butter just to grease a casserole dish. the thin potato layers with a bit of crispness were nice but i dont think ill be making this again.","1674020404","3"
"124340986","Easy Weeknight Dinner","Delicious! On our go-to side list for holidays. Modifications: doubled both cheeses. Notes: ended up over salting, so limit to 1 tsp of coarse kosher in the cream mixture and none on top (cheeses are salty on top). If you are using the mandolin and potatoes are actually 1/8” thin then cooking time is perfect. Did soak the potatoes in cold water as we peeled them so they didn’t brown but you shouldn’t do so any longer since they need the starch to make the gooey sauce as it bakes.","1681164109","3"

Put each potatoe in a wooden spoon, slice but so that it keeps together in the base. Plenty of butter on top, breadcrumbs and bake in the oven for an hour, basing with more butter.

"129312900","Peter","I was lured by the photo and followed the directions as written, packing the potato slices tightly in an oval baking dish.  After 3x30' @400, the potato edges looked beautiful, but the inner section was virtually raw. I had to pull it apart and cook for another hour. In notable contrast, another NYT Hassleback recipe calls for cooking single sliced potatoes @425 for 60-70', which open up naturally during cooking. (Lidey Heuck, #1024487). It seems odd that both recipe temps/times are correct.","1700592157","2"

I found that it was not as good this way. It took much longer than the final 30 minutes, the potatoes were not as smooth and creamy as when done in one long session and the cream did not cook down as much. I would never do it again this way as I felt you lost the superior flavor and texture of the recipe as is published.","1701233166","2"
