"20590124","Lisa","Tip for bright color *and* easy cranberry straining:  First I pureed the cranberry mixture in the pot with an immersion blender, then I pushed it through my sieve with a spatula.  It only took a minute or two and the puree is buttery smooth and NEON red.","1508887680","1109"
"16762037","Baba","If you want avoid some headache, I recommend the Julia Child/Alice Medrich method for peeling the hazelnuts rather than the oven method (which did not work for me).<br/><br/>1. Add 3 Tbs of baking soda to 2 cups of boiling water.<br/>2. Add the hazelnuts and boil for about 3 minutes until the skin removes easily from a hazelnut that you tested.<br/>3.  Pour the contents into a colander and run under cold water.  Fyi, the water will be black.<br/>4. Remove skin.  I used a paper towel to help remove the skin.","1509377025","1048"
"16664303","bsaylor","2 cups of almond flour will work instead of the hazelnuts and rice flour. You can add a little arrowroot flour or cornstarch. Or use half almond flour and half cup-4-cup.","1509376692","876"
"16677099","Eileen","I used the lemon poppyseed crust (minus the poppyseeds) from Melissa Clarks ricotta tart, it uses ground almonds and it was fantastic with the curd.","1509377460","401"
"20563512","David Tanis","Figure 1/2 cup orange juice. For maximum yield, don't let cranberry mixture ""cook down."" Strained cranberry mixture should yield a scant 1 + 1/2 cups. Even with less, should be sufficient for a 9- or 10-inch tart.<br/><br/>For the best color, make sure the curd is not overcooked (i.e. grainy) and be sure to cool (it thickens as it cools) before pouring into tart shell. If possible, make curd a day in advance. Will keep a week or more, refrigerated.","1508886937","359"
"16761711","kgs","Can regular white or wheat flour be substituted for the rice flour?  We don't need to avoid gluten, but would rather avoid extra shopping if possible.  Thanks in advance.","1509376835","254"
"25831529","Carol","I don't sieve the cranberries as the skins have a lot of pectin which helps the curd solidify. Plus I like the taste. I also use three whole eggs rather than 2 yolks and 2 eggs. I've made this several times and the curd has always been delicious.","1517774029","227"
"24933020","Ellen","For the color to remain the beautiful jewel-red, it might be better to add the butter last, and perhaps a little less of it.  I have made this recipe twice; the first time I forgot the butter till the end, and kept the lovely color.  This time I followed the directions and the butter lightened the cranberry puree to a pinkish-orangey tone, less attractive.  The old NY Times Cookbook recipe for lemon meringue pie left the butter to the end, with I think good results.","1511374948","200"
"17074937","Merle Gilmore","Loved this recipe but two hints for making it the next time:   1 - do ahead (make and freeze crust, make curd) but do NOT combine and bake until day of serving. The crust turned slightly soggy when it was made the day ahead and stored at room temp as indicated in directions. 2 - add extra liquid in the form of 2 - 3 ounces of non-pulp orange juice or unsweetened cranberry juice (which also makes an excellent Cosmo!)","1509378146","193"
"17042958","SCG","I too struggled with the volume of the cranberry mush after straining; to cut the tartness and to add volume, I made a stove-top vanilla custard and layered the cranberry curd on top, which ended up filling the pan perfectly, and the flavor combo is yummy! Baking it creates the lovely, bright color; it will look pasty before that. Cracking, roasting and peeling 50 raw hazelnuts was nuts (pun intended). Boil the nuts in baking soda in water and rise off skin in a cool bath; so much easier!","1509378543","184"
"20561710","Helen S. Fletcher","When I had my bakery, we made a Chocolate Cranberry Curd Tart (<a href=""http://pastrieslikeapro.com/2014/11/chocolate-cranberry-curd-tart)"" title=""http://pastrieslikeapro.com/2014/11/chocolate-cranberry-curd-tart)"" target=""_blank"">http://pastrieslikeapro.com/2014/11/chocolate-cranberry-curd-tart)</a>.  It featured a chocolate crust and chocolate ganache topping.  <br/><br/>We also just buzzed our cooked cranberries through the processor and although bits of the skin were left, it added to the charm of the tart and, when eating were not detectable.","1508887262","177"
"17582976","MissEmphasis","Despite the fuss involved sieving the cranberries without a food mill I turned around and made a second batch the moment I tasted the first. Yum yum yurrrm. I opted for three whole eggs instead of the 2 eggs, 2 yolks (I'm not fond of the taste of commercial yolks) and that worked beautifully. I served the curd with gingerbread one night and in a simple butter crust the next. And I ate a goodly portion directly out of the jar.<br/>Gorgeous color and tastes awesome.","1508870066","174"
"16757676","Janie F","It also seemed like it would take an eternity to push the cranberries through a sieve, so I just used an immersion blender and pureed. Perhaps not perfectly smooth, but tasted fine.","1509377289","164"
"20616043","Angelina","I didn't have time for the hazelnut crust, so I followed braylon's advice about the almond flour as a substitute (2 cups as a replacement for rice/hazelnut). This tart was a huge hit with kids and adults alike, especially with guests that have celiac. I used the pulp remaining in my mesh sieve in Mark Bittman's basic muffin recipe and the pulp (cranberry/orange peel) made a perfect flavoring.","1508887678","133"
"16796944","M","This is an unusually poorly written recipe.  Could you please add the amount of liquid we should expect from the orange (they vary considerably in size and in juice content) and after straining the cranberry mixture.  It was barely enough for one cup after I strained them.","1509377466","121"
"16867671","C. W.","I used a traditional pate sucree for the crust to accommodate someone with a nut allergy. Doubling the curd recipe filled my 12 inch tart dish beautifully. The cranberry curd was sumptuous and delicious. Just tangy enough to offer a nice counterbalance to the often saccharine duo of pumpkin and apple pie. Will definitely make this again!","1509378219","80"
"16805910","Tom","For people having trouble getting the filling to set, I used a teaspoon of arrowroot and the texture was perfect. I cooked the cranberries for longer than suggested -- forget the timer, just wait for the first bubble and then you're good to go. Beautiful rich red color, perfectly tart flavor. A big hit.","1509376692","76"
"16833370","Neil","What do you think about substituting a blood orange for the regular orange? The resulting tart would be less sweet and have a bit more color. What do you think?","1509378533","70"
"17090758","Meredith","This turned out great, despite how vague the recipe is. A few things I did:<br/><br/>1) Made crust in a Kitchen Aid mixer, using the paddle (flat) attachment.<br/><br/>2) I ran the cranberry mixture through my Champion Juicer. I ran everything through once, then ran the pulp through a couple more times, yielding a full cup of cranberry mixture. This seemed to be the perfect amount to then create the curd to fill a 10"" tart pan.<br/><br/>3) I replaced the butter with Earth Balance and the sugar with coconut sugar.","1508868757","68"
"29405914","Michele","-for bright color: make sure curd is not overcooked (grainy) and cool (it thickens) before pouring into tart shell. Puree cranberry mix w/immersion blender, then sieve  (also can put in food proc rather then sieve) -Use 1/2 cup OJ. For max yield, don't let cranberries cook down Strained cranberries yield abt 1 1/2 C.  - Best make curd day or even week bf.  Temper eggs bf adding - ok with 3 whole eggs  May need 1 tsp cornstarch Crust - ok with 2 c almond flr and no rice flr","1542227022","63"
"16723303","Norma T","Can one use a plain pastry crust? I love the idea of cranberry curd instead of lemon curd in a tart without the ""nutty"" flavor of this recipe.","1509376729","60"
"16723948","Carl Edwards","I'm thinking of a cranberry meringue pie.... à la Lemon Meringue Pie","1509376929","58"
"16932655","Lewis","Came out perfectly. Used 2 oz orange juice. Cooked the cranberries until they mostly broke down, then pushed through a sieve. Cooked the custard until it was steaming and really thick. Kept it in the refrigerator overnight and cooked the crust and tart the next morning. Had plenty of curd to fill the tart pan. Good cranberry red color. Everyone loved it.","1509379037","52"
"29564669","GrandmaJ","I made this twice-very popular. I did not strain the curd - used an immersion blender to purée. This results in a gorgeous red. For the crust, I used King Arthur gluten-free flour which works better for the crust. I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup and increased the butter to 4 oz because it was too crumbly. For the filling, I increased the cranberries to 18 ounces, butter to 4 oz, and used 3 eggs   3 yolks, leaving the sugar at 1 cup which made enough to fill the 10” tart yet not too sweet.","1543515964","42"
"16757336","lenora","I made this on Saturday during a Gluten Free/Dairy Free Pre-Thanksgiving cooking party. Yes, we had fun. One note and a question. Note: I think the food mill is a must, we spent  A VERY LONG TIME pushing the cranberries through the sieve..A VERY LONG TIME. Also,my filling looked more pink than cranberry red...did I do something wrong?","1509376844","40"
"16911797","SenoraH-B","This recipe looks like it has better information about the liquid-to-other-ingredients ratios for the curd: <br/><br/><a href=""http://www.thekitchn.com/fall-recipe-cranberry-squares-133199"" title=""http://www.thekitchn.com/fall-recipe-cranberry-squares-133199"" target=""_blank"">http://www.thekitchn.com/fall-recipe-cranberry-squares-133199</a>","1509378230","38"
"16790805","Stu","I make a lemon cheesecake every year for Thanksgiving, but this year I substituted the cranberry curd in place of the lemon curd for the topping.  I cut back slightly on the sugar to keep things in balance.  The result was delicious, and the color was absolutely startling.  Now to experiment with pomegranate, passion fruit, blood orange, gooseberry, red currant, guava......","1509377045","35"
"16782271","Brioche","This recipe would have been much improved by stating the amount of cranberry liquid needed to match the rest of the ingredients.  My efforts with the cumbersome sieve process yielded only a cup of liquid. It didn't seem like much for the amount of butter and eggs.","1509377054","31"
"16794378","SusanS","I laboriously followed the directions on this to a T and was disappointed with the end product. Not at all fresh dark cranberry as pictured, but the pink beige others have complained about. If / When I try again, I will either up the orange juice quantity, or try the immersion technique with cranberries, as I think low amount of dark juice liquid was the culprit. The crust is amazing, though, and worth the trouble!","1509377472","26"
"17898863","Carol","Used Trader Joe's roasted shelled hazelnut to save a step. the cranberry curd took a little longer so I raised the heat to mark 4 on an electric stove.","1508871162","26"
"16669164","Rikki","What would you substitute for butter to make it dairy-free?  Shortening/margarine/Earth Balance?","1509377234","19"
"121697956","hannah","Rave reviews.  For the crust: - Remove as many hazelnut skins as you can but don’t sweat their presence too much - Add vodka instead of water (for flakiness)  For the curd: - Use three whole eggs - Use 1/2 stick butter (half the called for amount); Add it at the very end (after the eggs) - After cooking cranberries with orange peel, remove the peel and put the cranberries in a Vitamix blender; purée until smooth and skip the straining step","1669578578","19"
"29211841","Anika","Winter just got so much better with cranberry curd! OMG, I'll forever be grateful to the person who came up with the idea and this awesome recipe. I followed the advice from previous commenters and blended the cooked cranberries before straining them. The result was a bright hot neon pink. It just looks fabulous! For the crust, I used Yossi Arefi's crust for lime bars and it just complemented the curd. SO. GOOD!!","1540862917","18"
"16777665","Ellie","I made this according to the recipe and it was a big hit at the thanksgiving dessert table. <br/><br/>I did have to cook the curd longer, closer to 20 minutes, but it did thicken and was perfectly set after baking for 10 minutes. I also found that I had more crust than needed to fill the pan and also wished that the curd volume was a little higher. <br/><br/>I would definitely make this again because it is so beautiful and unique.","1509377564","17"
"16810630","Baba","I agree about the curd to crust ratio.  I was surprised by how thick the crust was.  I personally prefer a thinner crust, though luckily my family didn't mind the thick crust.  On the tartness, it was too sweet for me, but I prefer things to be pretty tart.  Next time I will reduce the amount of the crust and I will use 1/2 the amount of sugar and substitute a lemon in place of the orange.  The orange I used was very sweet.","1509378941","17"
"17053560","BNP","This recipe was a Christmas Eve hit and turned out wonderfully! I followed the recipe exactly, but took the advice of some reviewers and doubled the curd. I was glad that I did because I needed a bit extra. I agree that it would be helpful to know exactly how much orange juice to add (not all oranges are created equal) and how much liquid one should have after mashing the mixture through a sieve. I decorated the tart with a dusting of powdered sugar, a few fresh cranberries and holly leaves.","1509378213","16"
"24925636","Erin","I used a basic shortbread crust instead of the hazelnut crust, as my family doesn’t particularly enjoy hazelnuts. This recipe is divine.","1511313835","16"
"26097385","Heidi","This is the 2nd time I've baked this. Love the recipe! If you run the cranberries through a sieve, the texture is pleasing but you lose the vibrant cranberry color. I much prefer using a Cuisinart to blend the cranberries and retain the deep cranberry red. The video provided really helps streamline the process. I'm not sure why my kitchen always looks like a tornado hit it after I've made this tart and not at all like the kitchen shown in the video!","1519429633","16"
"24905307","Cait","You cooked the eggs when you added them! The cranberry butter mix was too hot, so when you added the eggs, it cooked. That’s why the recipe calls for adding a cup of cranberry first, to temper it, when the proportions are close to equal so it can’t cook it. Then you add it to the rest of the cranberry juice.","1511203282","15"
"110260761","Leslie","You could cheat and just put the curd in a store-bought crust.  Sometimes easy is a virtue.","1605986500","15"
"20498427","BNP","I made this recipe for Christmas Eve dinner last year and it was a huge hit! It was a lot of work, but well worth it, and I didn't have trouble regarding the crust, color, etc, that some chefs reported. I followed the directions, but I doubled the curd recipe. On the days following Christmas, I served the extra curd on scones, which was delicious.","1508887033","13"
"29419201","MJ","Untrue! I suggest you put the entire batch into a Vitamix or use an immersion blender. The skin of the cranberries makes the pie bright red. Mine looked beautiful both times I made it.","1542320547","13"
"20622097","tungstencoil","Julia Child method of peeling hazlenuts (Google; or covered in other comments) worked well.<br/><br/>This was excellent! It comes out seeming like it was very fancy, but it's quite easy to make. I had no issue working the cranberry curd through a standard sieve/mesh colander. It took about 5 minutes of gentle working with a spatula. Keep at it, and you will be rewarded.<br/><br/>Made two - one with 3 limes instead of orange. Both were tasty, but the lime version was more popular with everyone.","1508886773","11"
"25345486","Anna L.","In regards to the curd, I would definitely recommend blending & straining it to get that gorgeous red color. The second time I made it, I didn't have any fresh oranges so I used 1/2 cup fresh orange juice and 2 tbsp frozen orange zest that I sieved out when I strained the curd.   Watch the temperature for both cooking the cranberries and the final curd. By keeping the cranberries below 200F and the eggs around 160F, I got a much smoother set/finish on the final tart.","1514325454","11"
"110749678","ANetliner","Curd:   1. Make double recipe or add more cranberries (16 oz vs 12); recipe does not yield much. 2. Juice/liquify orange to extract maximum juice: 1/2 cup needed. Use tart cherry juice if need more liquid. 3. Purée cranberry mixture finely in blender or food processor before sieving. 4. Fine mesh sieving was 30 mins; try medium mesh sieve. 5. Reduced sugar to a little less than 3/4 cup. *6.To hold color: do *not* add butter until *after* adding eggs, heated curd to near bubbling, and cooled.","1608778732","11"
"20611380","Beth","I loved this! I'm so glad I tried this recipe. Also, I had no problem pushing the cranberries through a sieve with a wooden spoon. Took only a few minutes. My only note for next time is that the filing ended up a little short in the crust; I would probably use 16 oz. of cranberries next time plus a TBS more of butter and one more egg yolk. Oh, and I hated trying to get the skins off the hazelnuts, so fussy, so I gave up with half still on, and the crust was still amazing.","1508887767","10"
"25260779","Andrew","Recipes for cooking fruit curds are often vague as to what ""thickened"" means. This recipe is no exception. You don't want to overcook the mixture and ruin it, but it needs to be cooked.  Stirring the curd with one hand, I Googled ""Cooking fruit curd"" with the other and found a video from joyofbaking.com, wherein she states that curds should be cooked to 160 degrees.   Also, I sieved the fruit through a tamis (sp?). I tasted the leftover solids and they were delicious!","1513587567","10"
"25831499","Carol","This time I doubled the ingredients to make two tarts, one 9"" and the other 11"". The 9"" tart was baked and served the same day while the   11"" prebaked crust and cranberry curd were frozen seperately.  The curd defrosted for a day in the fridge and the crust defrosted overnight. It worked beautifully. Once defrosted, I proceeded with the recipe to set it for 10 minutes at 350F. It's great to have this option. Both tarts were amazing!!","1517773736","9"
"29373351","Cactus Pear Curd Tart","I’m in TX and prickly pesrs are abundant here so I substituted them for the cranberries. I used slightly less sugar and substituted sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds for the hazelnuts. Results: Absolutely phenomenal.","1541999922","9"

"20967469","Sarah V.","This tart was a hit at Thanksgiving, especially with those who don't normally like pie. Next time I'll skip the hazelnut crust, it was too grainy for my taste. I also blended the cranberries rather than pressing them through a sieve - the texture turned out just fine.","1508859133","8"
"25388766","C in DC","We made this & everyone loved it. We took the easy way out and made only the curd instead of the entire tart, served with whipped cream and bittersweet chocolate shaved on top.  Much simpler & probably equally delicious!  We will make this again.  Used the hand blender and added butter last, as suggested by several below - it had a gorgeous color and taste","1514760960","8"
"29362797","Mel Harte","for an equally delicious, neon, no fat, egg-less filling: soften 1 T gelatin in 1/2 C water, add 2 C fresh cranberries, bring to boil, simmer 5 min. stirring often; cool. Beat til mixture holds firm peaks: 2 egg whites, 1 T lemon juice, pinch salt, and cranberry mixture. Pour into prepared baked crust.  Optional: top w 1 C cream whipped to firm peaks w 1 T sugar. Never have used the whipped cream; so delicious as is.  A decades old recipe from a friend that I've never seen elsewhere.","1541874865","8"

"29959640","Carol","Made this wonderful tart again for ringing in 2019. As a shortcut with hazelnut meal on hand(7 Oz.), I just toasted it in 350 for ten minutes and sifted that with rice flour and salt into bowl and proceeded with recipe. It looked and tasted great. Added a touch of water and butter to crust to hold together. The finished cooled tart just peeled off the bottom of the tart pan. Wish I could post the picture. The fuchsia colored cranberry curd against the hazelnut crust looked and tasted divine.","1546358804","6"
"16708519","beka","You want to remove the skin & seeds I should think; vitamix would not do that. If you don't have a sieve use cheese cloth.","1509376759","5"
"16735799","Carla","It seems like you don't add any water to the cranberries. They cook in the orange juice (the cranberries will release liquid as they cook, and the sugar melts to liquid as well). Hope it turned out well!","1509377334","5"
"17033678","Brigitt","As is, I'd give this recipe 4 stars. It did need a little tweaking. I too did not get nearly enough filling by pressing through a sieve (and it took forever), so the tart felt lackluster. To solve that, I topped it with a meringue, which was a delicious addition and how I will prepare it again. I am trying this again today, and will try the immersion blender in hopes of yielding more filling!","1509378880","5"
"25346389","Kate","I read the top comments & followed Baba's suggestion for peeling the hazelnuts, & Lisa's for pureeing the cranberry mixture before pressing through a sieve. I also made 1.5 x the curd recipe and it was just the right amount with some left over for me. The results were spectacular. The vibrant red curd was satiny smooth and deliciously tart and the hazelnut crust added texture and contrast. I served it with a dollop of fresh whipped cream and everyone raved. So good!","1514331639","5"
"29867811","Shelly","Love this recipe. I made it into 5, 5"" tarts. Made the crust a week early and froze, cooked the curd 2 days ahead of time and baked off this morning (12.23). Now with dessert done, I am moving onto other Christmas Eve dishes. I did this for Thanksgiving as well and it held up beautifully. One note: with the suggestion of others I ran the curd through the food processor before the mesh bag. Almost all of it went through the mesh bag this way and the flavor and color are rich and vibrant. ","1545584679","5"
"30011500","Audra","Amazing pie that is always a crowd pleaser, I have made several times now. I used a store bought crust and substituted lemon juice ( what I had on hand) and it still was delicious. I also top with meriengue which helps balance out the tartness without adding to much sweetness. It is good all year round because is it fruity and light.","1546709757","5"

"110258911","Grace","I was thinking of making this for Thanksgiving and just wondered if there was a specific kind of rice flour that should be used here. I have superfine brown rice flour and sweet white rice flour... but should I just ""rice flour""?","1605974381","5"
"110273193","Sarah","I made the curd again, without any orange at all. I compared just using water (way creamy curd that barely set up enough) with using just cranberry juice. I put a pinch of salt in both batches, and pureed them with a vitamix. No straining at all. I made 1/3 recipes, and used 1 whole egg in each.  I like both better than the orange flavored pink nonsense that this recipe results in.","1606093943","5"
"110328149","Andrea S.","If you want more intense cranberry taste (beyond pureeing and sieving the cranberries), consider increasing the amount of cranberries. In the current proportions, the fat is overpowering and the curd needs balance in the form of extra acidity.","1606367967","5"
"114970744","Maggie","This was a beautiful tart; I loved the delicious cranberry custard filling! However, I would have skipped the crust and just used a basic shortcrust. It tastes great, but I don't think it pairs terribly well with the cranberry. It's also very delicate and crumbly, easy to make a mess of. You could also probably double the amount of filling for an 11-inch tart pan, there was definitely a lot of crust compared to a thin amount of filling. I bet this would make some extraordinary mini tarts, too!","1634054542","5"
"121208295","rebeccall80","I’ve made this with a half graham cracker/ half hazelnut crust and a pure graham cracker crust and it’s phenomenal. Full stop.   Honestly it doesn’t matter what crust you use. The curd is so unctuous and delicious.   Make this for thanksgiving. You’ll never make a pumpkin pie again.","1667092010","5"
"17043802","Leslie","Made this curd exactly as described--Turned out beautifully and had a wonderful color! Also decorated it with some homemade candied cranberries. Lastly, didn't have access to any hazelnuts, so I used an Ida Gardner lemon curd tart recipe for the crust (flour, sugar, butter, vanilla) and baked two smaller, 7in tarts. I made it all ahead of time and baked it the day of (froze the crust and refrigerated the curd).<br/><br/>Guest LOVED it!<br/><br/><a href=""https://www.pinterest.com/pin/279293614369658545/"" title=""https://www.pinterest.com/pin/279293614369658545/"" target=""_blank"">https://www.pinterest.com/pin/279293614369658545/</a>","1509379066","4"

"25345500","Anna L.","OH one more note: I haven't tried lessening the sugar like other reviewers have, but I completely agree that the recipe as written is far too sweet. To alleviate that (I wasn't sure if reducing the sugar would compromise the structure of the curd) I added a healthy pinch of salt. Much improved! Definitely taste as you go. Fills 10"" tart pan perfectly.","1514325529","4"
"25352846","CaTo","I already reviewed this, but after eating the tart over a couple of days, would take the advice of others and try Melissa Clark’s lemon poppyseed crust next time. The hazelnuts are a bit rich and compete somewhat with the wonderful flavor of the curd.","1514401464","4"
"25380018","J.","For step 6, I found a shortcut that works beautifully and yields a bright reddish liquid. After the cranberries are cooked to bursting, transfer the cranberry mixture from the pan to a blender. Purée the mixture, covering the blender lid with a kitchen towel and holding it on as it operates. When the mix is well-puréed, pour it through a medium-mesh sieve or colander into a bowl and proceed with the rest of the steps.","1514665284","4"
"29477709","Paul","This is really good, a nice variation on my usual cranberry orange relish (1 bag c, 1 cup sugar, 1 orange, blend all in food processor until smooth 48 hours before needed).   1) The curd is a little sloppy. Bake longer? Cook on stovetop longer? 2) Not quite as much volume as I wanted, and there was a lot of cranberry pulp left over. Should I process the pulp more to extract more juice?","1542764533","4"
"29498052","Maguy","Easy, excellent and spectacular (beautiful bright pink).  I used 2 cups of almond flour and 1/4 cup of rice flour for the crust.

"104216363","Nina","This may be my new favorite dessert! Visually stunning and not too sweet. I followed others' suggestions and substituted 1 cup almond flour for the hazelnuts. I substituted POM for half of the orange juice, which added to the already intense ruby color. With the 2 egg whites left over from making the curd, I made a meringue (1/4 cup sugar and a pinch of cream of tartar) and piped a few stars on top of the filling before baking.","1576708495","4"

It's enough for a 10"" tart pan, and tantalizingly flaky. This is the 3rd time I've made this curd. I pureed the cranberry mixture with an immersion blender and quickly worked it through a sieve using a spatula. For a 10 inch pan I make 1 1/2 times the curd recipe. I garnished with pomegranate seeds, zested and microplaned orange rind, and pinches of fresh rosemary.","1667758081","4"

Ended up adding a tsp of cornstarch (I'd add more next time) to the custard before pouring it in the crust and baking the filled pie at 370 for about 25 minutes. <br/><br/>But in the end it was a success!

"29960461","Rachel","Wow! Ready for breakfast on NYE. This turned out really nicely. I froze my crust prior to baking for around 24 hours. I used a bag of frozen cranberries. I meant to measure my orange juice; I had a large orange, and I think a medium might have been a tiny bit better. The curd set really nicely and tastes great. I considered reducing the sugar but I'm glad I didn't; I also added a tiny bit of salt. The crust:curd ratio might be a bit high but the crust tastes so great I don't even mind!","1546363277","3"

Because my cooking schedule was packed, I made the crust with 2 cups of almond flour, butter, and sugar. I don't know who needs to hear this, but put your tart pan (the ones with a removable bottom) on a baking sheet.

Worked beautifully; the colour is gorgeous and velvety. 3. Baked an extra whopping 15 MINUTES!

Used a regular pecan shortbread crust--didn't feel like doing GF and didn't need to. Used Earth Balance in place of regular butter: it works. It turned out beautifully. I might sieve next time, but I loved the combination of flavors. Got a ton of brightness and tartness from the crans and they balanced perfectly with the buttery pecans!","1602906014","3"

"110648846","Cameron A","Some notes from a novice baker: — Substitute normal flour for rice flour and almonds for hazelnuts (or go 50/50 on the nuts) — Don’t worry if you miss some hazelnut skins — Don’t overbook your cranberry mixture; aim for syrup not jam — Use a full stick of butter for the curd (the recipe has an error in weights of butter) — Watch the video to see the desired thickness when you’re cooking the curd. Don’t worry too much—you can always bake the tart longer (I did 20 mins) if you undercook the curd","1608178759","3"

"121535740","QueenSashy","I made it both with hazelnut and almond meal, as suggested by many readers. Almond flavor works better with cranberries. The recipe is written for an experienced baker so a couple of comments. Use pie weights or take the crust out halfway through and press it back into shape with your fingers. 15 minutes is not enough baking time more like 20 (I do 23 at 325 convection). The quantities of filling are OK if you are using blender; with sieve there is waste, so you will have to up the filling.","1668702197","3"
"121657729","MissNewBougieBaker","I’ve tried the roasting method (indicated in recipe) AND the boiling method (described by other commenters) to remove the hazelnut skin and found the roasting method produced a better color and flavor and that the oil released while roasting help the dough come together better without having to add water.  Roasting was also less messy and easier to clean up in my opinion.","1669242485","3"

Also, I didn't have hazelnuts on hand so I went with an almond-based crust instead.

I might have overcooked the sauce to the point where nothing would go through the sieve, but it did not affect the end result in any major fashion.  The crust was not nearly as daunting as I had feared, and the smell of roasting hazelnuts was well worth the extra time!","1669652534","2"
"121747102","Sally","I made the cranberry curd as directed. Used a short crust dough because of nut allergies. Had just enough filling for one tart after straining. Was hoping for more tartness so next time will use lemon juice instead of orange. It was a beautiful, festive color. My son said he liked my tried and true lemon tart better.","1669778156","2"

"121775179","ryand","Measure, don’t weigh ingredients!  We made this for Thanksgiving this year (2022) and found that the butter ratio for the crust was WAY off in our first attempt.. The crust pooled into the tart pan and completely lost its shape, even after freezing for multiple hours. While rushing to rebake, I realizing that 6 tablespoons of butter most definitely does not equate to 100 grams! A stick of butter is tbsp, or 113 grams (as marked). 6 tbsp == 85 grams! Using this amount worked well the 2nd time.","1669908278","2"
"121783278","Hannah","This was beautiful and delicious. I needed more direction on set-ness/done-ness for the custard. I was hoping for more pumpkin-pie-like texture; this was like pudding in a pie shell, even after baking longer than advised.","1669929269","2"
"121954310","LW","I followed recommendations to add the butter as the last step before cooling and I actually liked the curd so much better before the butter.","1670818274","2"
"121987690","Sam","Absolutely delicious.  Used my vitamix to puree the cranberries and was able to get it so smooth straining it was unnecessary.  Made an almond flour crust instead, and it was fantastic.  Served with whipped cream and it was a total hit.","1670960007","2"
"122163492","uthomson","Wonderful curd recipe for any cranberry  aficionados. Making the crust is very labour intensive - albeit delicious, the next time I will just make a simple pie or tart crust.","1671744503","2"
"122164388","Jae","This is delicious! My family insists that I make it every winter solstice from here on. It's not as bright red as the photo suggests, even with the blending and straining approach. And I found 15 minutes was needed for the final bake instead of 10. I can hardly complain, though.","1671746800","2"
"122193490","dimmerswitch","Made crust using gram weights provided in recipe.  Rather than start with whole hazelnuts and roasting them, etc. to create hazelnut flour I used Bob's Red Mill brand hazelnut flour at the 180g weight and it worked out swell!  I did need just a couple of teaspoons of cold (iced) water to bring it all together (see Step 3 ""...or a little cold water"") and it was perfect texture to work with to press into a 10"" tart pan bottom and sides.  Froze overnight before baking.","1671899382","2"
"122194523","Crust needed Fiddling, but Wow...","I made this with unpeeled pecans, and the crust did slide down into a puddle on baking. I used the back of a soup spoon to reform it into tart shape, holding it against the pan as it cooled. For filling, pureed in a high speed blender for a couple of minutes then strained, only 1/4c solids left.  But the payoff: served it at the end of a blowout Christmas Eve meal, and the whole table oooed and ahhhed over the color, then fell silent to savor each bite.","1671904859","2"

"122203415","t","I highly recommend using a more reliable crust recipe if you have. This was very unstable and melted into a puddle in the tart pan on the first bake.","1672000751","2"
"122596896","Diane","Could not find hazelnuts locally (!?) for the crust so used almond instead of rice flour and also ground up 1/2 c cashews to make total of dry ingredients the same.  Chilled it in the pie pan overnight as I did also with the filing.  It was beautiful & well received and I'll do it again the same way - doing it all in one day would be onerous. Served with vanilla ice cream.","1673886812","2"
"122714568","Blair","Made this tonight and it was a hit! I had planned to use almond flour as other reviewers suggested, but ended up finding Hazelnut flour at Whole Foods - if you can find it, it’s a great time saver! Also, I forgot about the rice flour - I didn’t have any and just used AP flour and it was fine.   Definitely don’t skip the step to purée the cranberry mixture! Makes it so much easier to get through a sieve, and as others have commented, made for a vibrant red final product - will make again!","1674346207","2"
"123564869","Joshua M","I used Irish butter and it left too much a butter note.  Use less butter or an American version.","1677951575","2"
"125313244","M.H./ D.C.","I used a regular buttery crust, added 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1/2 T of orange liqueur. Amazingly delicious. Creamy, tart, and sassy - lasted just 2 days for 3 ladies, even with our cutting verrrry thin slices.","1684981110","2"
"129083224","L S Paul","This might seem a bit tacky, but I ended up using pre-made Graham cracker tart shells instead of the hazelnut crust. One, there are family members with nut allergies. Two, people get a kick out of the little red neon tarts. Three, it's really easy to serve. I brought pumpkin chiffon pie to Thanksgiving for years. Now also served in tart shells.","1699639900","2"
"129170798","Benedicte","This will not end up in the “helpful” section, but can I tell you how much I love this recipe? It’s beautiful. Very well worth it to work on making as smooth a cranberry purée as possible.","1700015028","2"

"129191587","AnneH","If you are allergic to nuts use another crust, like a shortbread crust Ive seen for lemon tarts, or a graham cracker or even animal cookie crust. If you are allergic to hazelnuts use walnuts or anything else. I think pistachio would be stunning.","1700092210","2"

"129349759","Deb","I made the curd with orange peel and lime juice; the lime juice made a delicious, beautiful filling absolutely sublime (so to speak). This recipe takes time — cooking, cooling, blending, baking, cooling — but it’s a keeper.","1700763216","2"
"129350068","lisa","If you make the crust and the curd in advance they will both take much longer to bake, since you’re starting off with colder products. The crust took around 25 minutes to bake. The curd (refrigerated overnight) about    15-20 minutes. I love pecans and used Trader Joe’s toasted, salted pecans in place of the hazelnuts. It eliminated the toasting and skinning of the nuts and the results were delicious!","1700765680","2"
"129357428","Jessie","Super underwhelmed by this recipe. Made this w/ traditional crust— guess that could be the problem, maybe it balances the flavor. My issue is that the orange peel gave a muddy tropicana like taste when I was expecting bright cranberry flavor to accompany the fuchsia result. Wouldn’t make again as written. Might try w/o orange peel or w/ lemon or cranberry juice instead. Also was less firm than pumpkin pie. Meh. Used immersion blender and pushed blended mash through sieve.","1700848526","2"

"129386541","Alli","Made this. Was a flavorless disaster. Thought it was just me but went to a party where the hostess made it as well. Hers was beautiful but not good either. Not worth the effort, but now I’m inspired to try to make this actually delicious.","1701049762","2"
"129386594","Megan","Having an 11"" French tart pan, I added another 6 oz. of cranberries to the recipe but nothing else, as well as 1/4 c. port, 1 tsp cinnamon.  Had enough curd this way.  I let the cranberry mixture cool before I processed it.  I didn't notice the color going from red to lighter red until I added the eggs.  The butter didn't change the color but I did add it at the end of the cooking process.  The curd was quite tart.  But it didn't thrill me and was much too fiddle-y a recipe to do again.","1701050135","2"
"129441586","Mimi","Recreate the protagonist's birthday dinner scene from Bridget Jones' Diary with this dish. ""Delicious..."" your acerbic friends will hiss sardonically as they suck pulp from between their teeth.  I was the butt of the joke on Thanksgiving. Please refrigerate your pie after cooking. The flavor was there, but it was a puddle of pudding. After refrigerating overnight it was presentable, but too late for me.","1701274741","2"
