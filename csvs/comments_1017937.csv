"17378250","Mimi Pond","I don't understand folks fussing about stirring together a few ingredients to make an impromptu ""ranch dressing."" Also fussing about the amount of fat. You put 6 T of butter in there. What do you expect? It's all delicious! Dump the whole big jar of pepperoncinis in is my only tweak. Y'all leave my Sammy alone. He works hard to bring you this stuff.","1508867559","2563"
"17391362","Dawn W.","Delicious, but Holy Greaseball Batman! Who eats a chuck roast cooked with a stick of butter? Is thatas much fat as the average adult should eat in a year?<br/>The butcher removed the outer fat. I seared the roast in olive oil, with no butter, mayo, etc., added 10 pepperoncini, a cup of white wine, 1.5 cups low sodium beef stock, a handful of fresh thyme branches, 6 peeled garlic cloves, & a slight sprinkle of crushed red pepper flakes. Then cooked it for 6.5 hrs. Incredibly delicious.","1508867611","1372"
"17402765","ralph","My wife made the recipe. She confused Porcini Mushrooms with Pepperoncini. A delicious mistake.","1508868936","944"
"17356237","Sam Sifton","Yes, of course. Three or four hours at 250 ought to do it, in a covered Dutch oven, maybe longer if your roast is large.","1508868475","846"
"17333858","Tom B.","I know I'll get nowhere with the average NYT reader but the fear of MSG is an old wive's tale and was thoroughly disproven decades ago. <br/><br/>MSG is simply a purified form of glutamate, which is a flavor compound found in everything from mushrooms to anchovies. Adding msg is no different and no more harmful than add adding powdered lemon juice (citric acid) for tanginess, or sugar for sweetness, or salt. Latest science indicates glutamate, far from being harmful, is probably beneficial.","1508868082","663"
"24198950","Tracy","I'm amazed by all of the anti-fat comments. America has been suckered by low-fat diets and processed low-fat foods for decades and we have rampant diabetes and other diseases. Read the new research! If you just don't care for fat, chill this dish in the fridge or freezer then skim the hardened fat off. How could 4 Tbs of butter distributed through a whole dish with a lot of it left at the bottom of the crockpot be bad for you? Strikes me as paranoia.","1508764917","570"
"17335696","Maureen","Personally, I am grateful for the alternative to the packaged items, as I have all the ingredients in my pantry already, and I don't usually have packaged salad dressing on hand.  Thank you NY Times, for this option, in spite of all the criticism you're getting for it.","1508868854","496"
"17365189","Robert Fenerty","A few years ago I sat at the chef's table at a Michelin  stared restaurant and watched a high-end steak being slathered with butter again and again and again during the saute, before it hit the oven. And then some more butter. Then serve.<br/><br/>I'd never seen anything like this before. The chef explained that home cooks cut out the fat and then wonder why their food doesn't taste like it does at the restaurant!","1508868074","441"
"17336302","Rosie Tunes","Homemade Buttermilk Ranch Dressing<br/>1 cup buttermilk<br/>1/2 cup mayonnaise<br/>1 teaspoon lemon juice<br/>1/8 teaspoon paprika<br/>1/4 teaspoon mustard powder<br/>1/2 teaspoon salt<br/>1/8 teaspoon black pepper<br/>1 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley<br/>1 teaspoon chopped fresh chives<br/>1/4 teaspoon of dry dill (or a teaspoon chopped fresh)<br/>-<br/>1 In a medium bowl, stir together the buttermilk and mayonnaise until fully mixed. Add in the other ingredients, adjusting for taste.<br/>About 1 1/2 cups. Keeps for a week, covered in the fridge.","1508868551","439"
"17348790","Sam Sifton","I cut the butter in half from the original recipe. You could go with even less. But I wouldn't forgo entirely. You want some fat to combine with the crust to make a kind of ""gravy.""","1508867580","434"

"17335996","barbinkent","Whoa, I make this recipe a lot. Here's another take on it.<br/>Braise meat. Use either dutch oven low, the slow cooker or a pressure cooker. <br/><br/>Slice large onion. Set it in. Add roast. Add dill, garlic, a little paprika...and the pepperoncini - I cut the tops off and occasionally take out seeds. Or, buy pepperoncini rings. I used to drain it, but seriously, no.<br/>ADD TWO LEFTOVER BEERS. Enough to cover meat! Add two bouillon cubes; cook til it falls apart. Chicago Style Italian Beef. Voila.","1508868652","342"

"17331415","John L.","Would love to see Dutch Oven alternative instructions.","1508868711","290"
"17335722","Michelle","In another article on his interpretation, Sifton said, ""I seared the roast before placing it in the slow cooker, browning it aggressively beneath a shower of salt and pepper and a coating of all-purpose flour that I hoped would create a fond, or base of flavor, to replace the gravy mix, and give some structure to the sauce.""","1508867823","257"
"17333703","Tom B.","People are afraid of mayo because they don't know what it is -- but it's basically just egg yolk, oil and water.  It serves as kind of a time-release moisture enhancer in recipes like this, and the lecithin in the egg yolk help to thicken and emulsify the sauce at the end.<br/><br/>In other words, it isn't essential, it just makes the meat slightly moister and the final sauce maybe a little creamier.","1508867379","213"
"17334927","Anna","it doesn't have ""no bearing"" it simply gives an option for not using chemical powdered food product and showed that it takes the same amount of time and tastes the same. great news for folks that don't want to eat that. And the replacement items are mostly things people have around anyway, or can be used again. I know you're going to want to call me snobby, but MSG makes my ankles blow up like balloons and get headaches so I really need to stay away from fake foods.","1508868321","182"

"29931886","s","If you don’t want to use a certain ingredient, that’s fine; just don’t. I don’t use packaged mixes, either.  I agree with the criticisms others have expressed.  But there is no need to call things that other people eat “fake.”  That is what comes across as self-congratulatory and snobbish.  ","1546100994","154"
"29698286","Chodo","Instant Pot: Brown meat on Saute function, remove and cancel. Use1/2 cup of broth (beef but I had chicken) to deglaze the pan.  Use wooden spoon to scrape off the delicious brown bits. Finish with 1/2 cup pepperoncini juice. Return roast, add remaining ingredients.  I smeared the ranch dressing right on 3-pound roast. Set the pressure cooker to HIGH for 60 minutes (30 min per pound).  Use a natural release (15-30 min) and release. Shred meat, return to pot for shocking delicious-ness.","1544497910","136"
"17332419","TJ","Converting from a slow cooker to cast iron has a # of variables, like cooking on a stove vs oven or slower cooking time vs faster than the crock pot. Rule of thumb is for cooking in the oven at 325 it's 1/4 time if the recipe calls for low and 1/2 time for high. If you want to cook slower in the oven, adjust the temp & do the math. There's a simple chart for this on the Cooking in Cast Iron web site, as well as many other cooking sites. Google it and you'll see.","1508868142","128"
"17332561","Linda","I always use a dutch oven. Don't like slow cookers at all. Set your oven on 300 degrees and allow 45 minutes per pound. You can sear it if you want to, but totally unnecessary. I make the Georgia version using my mother's recipe, which was actually her mother's recipe and goes back to the 1950s or earlier. Leave out everything except the onion soup mix. Use water. You can add some marsala near the end. Best served over long-grain rice.","1508867978","122"
"30524502","H","Stop. Now. Please. The original Mississippi Roast recipe as described in the now infamous NYT article is still one of the most heavenly & divine dishes ever. Yes - the one with the powder packets of Ranch Dressing & Au Jus Gravy with an ENTIRE stick of butter. I will grant you leeway on the amount of pepperoncini’s you use.  After I read the article it sounded so vile & disgusting I had to immediately make it. In a family of food snobs this became a huge favorite. Pro tip - try it with chicken.","1549599071","103"
"17401716","tel","Sear the roast in a dutch oven with salt, pepper and flour as Sifton suggests, in grapeseed oil. After the first flip, shake garlic & onion powder over top of meat.  Just as the brown fond begins to turn, add two tbs of unsalted butter to the bottom of the pan, underneath the meat.<br/>Spread package of dry ranch dressing mix on top of the meat, and lay two tbsp of butter on top.  Add 1/4 cup of beef stock and 12 pepperoncini, first rinsing off brine under the faucet. <br/><br/>3 hours at 300 degrees.","1508868731","93"

"17331309","Joe","If you wanted to make this in the oven in a cast iron Dutch oven, what should temperate be set at? 180?","1508867398","74"
"17332030","Justin","I often substitute a cast iron (usually enameled) dutch oven at aournd 200-225 for the same time as prescribed for the slow cooker. I find modern slow cookers to sometimes just be too hot, boiling on low is a no-no for me. <br/><br/>Your results may vary. Play with it a little bit. Braising is very forgiving if you cook to slow, not as forgiving if you cook too fast, in my experience.","1508867774","64"
"17331807","Tom","Enamel Dutch Oven. Sear the meat in the oven and proceed  with the recipe. It will go in a 300 degree oven for 2 to 3 hours. Just keep your eye on it. Cooking is not an exact science.","1508867586","48"
"30223234","Ruth","That sounds great, but that is now a completely different recipe than Mississippi Roast.  ","1547832698","48"
"17338634","Anita","Made this today using Sifton's recipe.  The only adjustments were (1) to the ranch dressing i added 1 minced clove of garlic, 2 tsp minced onion, pinch each of ground thyme and dried mustard, and (2) I reduced to half a 14 oz can beef broth and added to crock pot (reduced it in pan I uses to brown roast). Next time I might skip the broth bcz too much liquid.  Even so, the flavor is amazing! Will definitely make this again. Thank you, Sam Sifton, for the recipe!","1508868552","42"
"29720809","JT","Sam Sifton writes in ""Most Helpful"" comments: Yes, of course. Three or four hours at 250 ought to do it, in a covered Dutch oven, maybe longer if your roast is large.","1544636363","40"
"30421107","Alexis","There's no such thing as too much fat.","1548976190","40"
"17386221","Diane","I tried this recipe and it is a WINNER!!!   I cooked it in my Le Creuset dutch oven on a 300 degree oven for 3.5 hours and it came out fork-tender and delicious flavor.  I will put more pepperoncini in the pot, as we like to eat them as a condiment and they cooked down to nothing from the wonderful juices of the meat and the dressing.","1508867359","38"
"17340224","Cate","Gluten is a protein in wheat, spelt, farro, farina, semolina, durum, wheatberries, emmer, rye, barely, malt, and graham.  If you make this dish omit the wheat flour.  Gluten free flours/blends do not brown well, so I personally would skip gluten free flour blends.  Browning can be done without flour.<br/>If your guests are celiac, then its important to ensure there is no hidden gluten.  Common items with gluten include soy sauce, bouillon, blue cheese, hot dogs, seasoning blends, and sauces.","1508868127","37"
"17400933","Dlt","This was a spectacular dish for company.  Had friends over and they just kept eating it.  Used 4.25 lb roast. Follow recipe with max pepperoncine. After 8 hours, took meet out and allowed to cool slightly before shredding.  Decreased liquid, cooked down some and thickened slightly with cornstarch dissolved in water.  Poured back over shredded meat and gently rewarmed.  This is a definite keeper.","1508867454","36"
"17401572","Laura","Wow! Wow! Wow! This is the new 'pulled pork' in our household (and I have a pretty good recipe for slow cooked pulled pork). Disregard the comments about the grease. The butter added wonderful flavour and yes, I had to skim some off - no big deal. I  also cranked the slow cooker to high when the beef was done and added a bit of corn starch/water while shredding the beef. Amazing recipe! Thank you!!","1508868287","36"
"108871924","Richard","Sam: Thank you for this recipe.  Made it per directions, no addition or deletion of anything.  It was very easy to make and was very delicious.  Devoured by my husband and friends.   Just one comment for those of you that constantly complain about the content of items in a recipe.  No one is forcing you to make or eat anything.  There are so many recipes at NYT Cooking you can certainly find something you can make and eat without complaints.","1598659166","35"

"17350523","Judy","People are asking why not just use packaged dressing, au jus etc.  Some people have restricted diets but love good food.  I cook for my mom who has heart issues and gout and my brother who in is renal failure. Packaged and  canned foods are a veritable NO.  So I do have to substitute fresh homemade for packaged stuff and absolutely no canned soups or sauces. Cooking without canned and prepackaged flavorings are healthier for everyone but not nearly as easy quick.","1508867586","32"
"30111699","A. Cleary","Obscene fat content? For 8 servings, that's about .5 oz per person, a little more if you serve only 6! The gospel of low fat seems to still have plenty of frightened disciples.","1547235125","28"
"17331304","Nancy","Step 3 says to ""allow to continue cooking, undisturbed, for 6 to 8 hours."" Apparently that does NOT mean an additional long time period, as the total time is given as 6 1/2 to 8 1/2 hours. A bit confusing, however.","1508867607","27"
"18903469","WendyP","Sorry, but you made a different recipe.  Make as written then review.  It's a delicious alternative to ""traditional"" pot roast.","1508877722","27"
"17332168","Tom B.","I'd add a deglazing step. <br/><br/>You are searing the chuck to put a crust on it (and it can be a long hard sear because this is all going to be stewed anyway). You end up with nice fond in the pan that you want to add to the stock, plus a good bit of rendered fat. Use the rendered fat instead of butter. So deglaze that pan with chicken broth or wine or even water. <br/><br/>I would also add granulated garlic. And consider some MSG or fish sauce -- umami, baby.","1508868455","26"
"17335476","Richard","Cast iron dutch oven is what I use. Oven temp should be 300 or so. 200 would take too long. Check periodically and a little water if it's looking dryish. Once Roast is ""falling apart"" remove from the pot and carefully remove and scrape the bottom of the pot to loosen up the fond, maybe add little more water. Enjoy the ""fat gravy"" over the meat and rice. Louisiana Roast.","1508868092","26"
"17398676","tls","Made this with the addition of cremini mushrooms to soak up some of the seemingly excess butter.  Tasty!","1508868623","26"
"17335740","Michelle","You can also try it in a pressure cooker, if you have one of those.  I often substitute an hour of pressure cooker for 4-6 hours of slow cooker.","1508867702","25"
"17399286","THE RITT","Went off the recipe rails on this one...could not get my head around ranch dressing on a chuck, so I prepped as suggested. Then, after searing the chuck in oil as directed, I dropped it into a preheated covered dutch oven at 275 degrees. While the roast started cooking, I mixed 1 1/2 cups original heat salsa, 1/2 cup catsup, chopped onions and garlic, 2 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, 2 tablespoons thyme, and 1 cup red wine, which I had precooked until thickened, and added to the pot....WOW","1508868247","24"
"17348219","Heather","curious as to how the NYT's approach to this would ""break the budget"" given that the pantry ingredients listed are likely cheaper than the packets at the supermarket.","1508868043","23"
"17352682","Robert Fenerty","I made this precisely as Sam suggested and loved it. After 7 hours, my 3.5 pound roast was fork tender and tangy. At first, I didn't think there would be enough liquid to cook the meat, but as the butter and the fat from the roast melted, there was more than enough fluid to cook and meld the flavors. I did flip the roast after the first few hours.<br/><br/>Were I to make it again, I'd probably use 20 pepperoncinis, as they disintegrate quite a bit by the time the roast is cooked.","1508867559","23"
"17428046","Lynn","Following others, I used the same ingredients, but seared then cooked it in a Dutch oven instead of a slow cooker. But I made it for the next day. So when I took it out of the fridge the fat was congealed on top of all the liquid. I just removed it, heated at all up, shredded it, and used only the liquid/gravy that was left. Perfect! Next time (and there will be a next time -lol) I'll use much less butter.","1508870606","23"
"17331755","Alexandra","This looks wonderful, but before investing all this money and time, I would really like to know what the function is of the mayonnaise. Wouldn't heavy cream, sour cream or extra oil with a dash of mustard do the job just as well and be more natural? Any comments on the basis of experience?","1508867573","22"
"17489077","LS Gourmet","To those of you who changed the recipe and complained that it didn't come out right:  Go back and try it again the way it is written then if you don't like it you'll actually have something to discuss.  I followed the recipe, a 3 lb chuck steak was done in 7 1/2 hrs, shredded beautifully and tasted great.  It is slightly reminiscent of the old Lipton's Onion Soup Mix version from the 50's.  It's not haute cuisine, but it is really good.","1508870483","21"
"28723358","Lisa","I love trying new recipes and often read reviews before I do.  If you don’t care for a recipe or change it more than a little cut to the salt type tweak, then don’t post a review.  Thanks!","1537797337","21"

"30254544","Laurie","Made in instantpot, high pressure 60 minutes, natural release for 30 minutes. Perfect. I added 1/2 cup beef stock to make sure there was enough liquid for pressure cooking, but it wasn't necessary and I won't do next time. Also added 1 yellow onion chopped, 6 cloves garlic, and 1/2 cup pepperoncini pickling liquid and will do all those next time. Served on raw zucchini noodles. They were also perfect.","1548031945","19"
"17331871","Christian s Herzeca","@beatrice and john l<br/><br/>on the likelihood that you won't get a NYT response, let me venture that i have found that braising in a creuset with top on at 275F will replicate slow cooker results over about a 4 hour period.  best to check in periodically and at end crank up heat a bit and take top off for maybe half hour","1508867478","17"
"17410591","Steven Stark","I just made this and it was awful. Stringy, fatty meat in a gravy full of fatty globules. No discernible flavor. Absolutely disgusting and a real disappointment. Note to self: never trust the internet.","1508870167","17"
"17418315","Carla","Was very intrigued by the story of this roast so I searched out the original recipe on the internet.  Well, I made it exactly as the original recipe stipulated except that I cooked it in the oven in a covered Dutch oven (6 quart) at 275 to 300 for 4 1/2 hours.  After letting it cool a bit, I poured the resulting liquid into my gravy separator and got rid of the fat, then returned the liquid to the pot for reheating.  All I can say is Wow!  And it took 2 minutes to assemble!","1508869317","17"
"23694162","Cindy","I do it in the instant pot all the time. I follow the recipe as written and cook for 90 minutes under pressure. It comes out great.","1506882254","17"
"26737749","Mary Van","I have made this recipe many times with great success. Low heat setting on my crock pot is about 200F, which is perfect for cooking the roast. I now make a couple of small adjustments to the original recipe: I thinly slice an onion and place it at the bottom of the crock before adding the meat, and I deglaze the skillet with a couple of tablespoons  of white wine or broth after searing the meat, then add it to the crock pot at the beginning of cooking.","1523732998","16"

Don't own a slow cooker so cooked it in the oven at 250 for 4 hours and it shredded beautifully.<br/>Thanks to the comments, added double the dressing amount, cut the butter in half, used more pepperoncini and added some garlic.

"17333248","rjsp","Pepperoncini (which I think are what you mean) are the smallish (around 2"" long), light-green, mildly hot pickled peppers that can be found in any grocery store, at least here in New England. They are a staple addition to subs (hoagies? heroes?  what's your regional term?), and their distinctive, vinegary aroma is found in many a sandwich shop in these parts.","1508868863","13"

For my part, followed the recipe EXCEPT (nod to its humble origins) forewent the salt & added a packet of good ole onion soup mix. 2 mayo haters in the house meant more buttermilk & a scoosh of sour cream for ranch","1603914515","13"
"17410926","JRB","I was entirely skeptical about this odd recipe but figured i needed to make it as it made no sense.  Wow.  I got a very good quality chuck roast so it was not fatty; i used an entire bottle of pepperoncini but next time would follow the 8-10 recommendation  as the whole jar made it a bit too hot in my view.  My only adjustment was about 8 cloves of roasted garlic, 3 of raw garlic, and half a sliced onion.  I cooked it on low slow cooker setting for 9 hours.  Make this, honest!","1508869700","12"

Any type of oil can be used, olive oil, duck fat, or best is bacon fat,liberally season w Cajun/Creole seasoning,brown the meat all over, medium high heat, the add a few chopped up onions and a packet of Lipton onion soup mix.

"17436781","Liz K.","Delicious  The key to cutting any greasiness is to trim all fat.  Brown it well.  I used 1/2 the butter and added a chopped onion.  I used the homemade ranch dressing suggested by Rosie in the comments (so YES to the buttermilk and more dried mustard/paprika).  Already chopped jarred pepperoncini (Mezzetta) all the better. Will be even tastier tomorrow on a sandwich with slaw or shredded lettuce.  Anyone complaining of little flavor isn't  salting/peppering or browning properly.","1508870044","11"

Don't have a slow cooker, so I used a Dutch oven; 6 1/2 hours at 250. I used a round roast, ~2.75 lb. To shred, I cut it across the grain into 1-in. hunks, then shredded those. We loved it. Used leftovers for enchiladas. Wonderful! I may make in the future for that purpose alone.","1508870538","11"

DON'T skip the browning of the meat on all sides! I used a 12"" cast iron skillet heated for 20 minutes in a 500 degree oven, then immediately moved to stovetop to start the browning. The most amazing sear & explosion of flavors in the roast!","1552331734","3"

Then cooked it for 6.5 hrs. Incredibly delicious.","1567255291","3"

We were eating it in sandwiches but recently also started using it as filling for tacos. I took an idea from a slow-cooker pork carnitas recipe—place the cooked meat into a frying pan, let it cook undisturbed till it starts to brown up and get a bit crispy on the edges which brings the flavor to the next level. I leave out the pepperocini and add a bit more vinegar.","1618876035","3"

The payoff is very high for the effort.   3. I'm always amused by people who say ""I did this, but changed 12 things about the recipe."" If you do that it could be quite delicious, but it's not this recipe.  Make it. It's a great recipe.","1650760443","3"

If I make it again I will leave out the butter and make it a day ahead so I can pick off the hardened fat before I shred the beef. Also, I wasn't clear on what to do with the peppers. Do you shred them up with the meat or pull them out and put them on the side or get rid of them?<br/>It turned out to have a nice flavor that made it different from the standard pot roast.","1508887246","2"
"20541483","hanan","Sam Sifton  9 months ago<br/>Yes, of course. Three or four hours at 250 ought to do it, in a covered Dutch oven, maybe longer if your roast is large.","1508887932","2"

I'm not normally a beef eater and I liked it, and my husband was so enchanted he told his colleagues about it at work the next day.<br/><br/>I had a bottle of nice ranch dressing in the fridge so I just added a splotch of that on top of the roast.

I googled ""Canadian for chuck roast"" and the results were ""blade roast"" or shoulder roast.  Some suggested that the kosher butcher shops were more likely to know what this roast was. I also used my Instant Pot as a pressure cooker, and only for an hour. The result did not come near the deliciousness I've had with the same recipe in the IP slow cooker for 7 hours.","1522866123","2"

"123490172","Bill L","I’ve tried this recipe out twice, really wanting hard to like it.  But alas, you’d be far better off taking your nice chunk of beef and making Pot Roast.  This recipe, besides being very fatty (even with only a 1/2 stick of butter) just has a one-note flavor, and not all that enticing.  So, no third time for me. Pot Roast has so much more favor with its carrots and potatoes and what other root veggies you want to add.   Note that this is the first time I’ve ever felt compelled to add a note.","1677676193","2"
"123977511","Guitarguy_1963","This is pretty similar to our home method of the famous Chicago Italian Beef.  I know they don’t use chuck in Chicago but in a slow cooker if you’re just looking for melting beef, made easily that can stand in with a crowd and you don’t have a meat slicer, well…just add some Italian herbs.","1679636578","2"

"125907038","JaneCareyMary","Fantastic! Getting a good crust on all sides of the roast significantly enhanced the flavor.   Tips: Divide butter around the 4 sides of the meat. Put pepperoncini rings on top and ranch dressing under the roast. Turn meat over halfway through the cook time. Shred the beef, then pour remaining liquid (tad greasy) into a pot. While heating, skim part of the grease then add 1 tbs corn starch mixed with 2 tbs Worcestershire. Added 1 c beef stock. Cook down by 1/3. Serve over buttered egg noodles.","1687577947","2"

"136242614","Half and half","I had made the original recipe that NYT published by the group of women. It contained the with the store bought ranch etc. It was the worst thing I had ever tasted. I regretted having to throw the whole thing out but could not think of how to wash it of that horrible chemical taste.","1726576259","2"
"136296348","LGL","I'm sure that my earlier response is well hidden in this vast amount of notes.  But this, truly, was one of the absolutely worst recipes I've ever made in nearly 50 years of cooking.  And I've probably only said that about a handful of recipes.  Way too greasy.","1726716630","2"
