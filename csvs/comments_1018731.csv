"22531209","elh","Look, I have never written about a recommendation before, but I would be unfair if I didn't tell anyone reading this that this really is the best roast chicken recipe I've made.  And I make roast chicken a lot as we believe a good roast chicken is the perfect food.  For years, we've said, ""Is it better than Marcella's?"" The answer's always no.  Until tonight.  Don't do any of the ya-di-dahs recommended--make it as is--and love every bite.  ","1506868968","1290"
"22396862","Paul","Hey y'all, I think the objective here was to get your impression of this recipe not for you to talk about your own creations. Just saying....","1506867308","614"
"31524072","Julie Spencer","You can freeze your leftover buttermilk in 1-cup portions or any convenient size. It keeps very well and defrosts quickly.","1555173280","396"
"22579124","Claude","I think the idea was for people to react in any way they wanted. Commenting on the recipe or suggesting other related ideas are equally valuable in my opinion.","1506868343","383"
"30243925","Kate NYC","OMG.    I've been roasting chickens for 40 years and I've done them all: Child, Hazan, with rosemary and without, stuffed with lemon or empty, basted or brined, and the Zuni Cafe version that set off the smoke detectors not only in my apartment but also in my neighbors' above and below. But this version is in its own class as the best of them all. It also helped me appreciate Nosrat's lessons about salt. She is a genius.  Best of all? It just tastes like chicken. Juicy and delicious chicken","1547948608","366"
"26607467","Jena' Hatchett","This is the best roasted chicken I've ever made.  Moist and tender.  Beautiful color.  And that's with cheating on the marinating time.  I didn't realize it should be done overnight.  I'm 70.  Been cooking for 60 years.  That's a lot of roasted chicken.  So glad to find this recipe.","1522931838","291"
"22307100","Gary","This was quite delicious!  I used store-bought buttermilk and marinated the chicken for about 20 hrs.  There was no sign of mushiness from the marinade, and the chicken was extremely tasty and juicy.  I roasted it on a rack set over a roasting pan in which I put some cut-up potatoes and carrots and a handful of whole, peeled shallots.  The chicken juices and the residual buttermilk gave the veggies a nice flavor as well.  I'll definitely make this again!","1506866648","230"
"22272399","Arthur","Before trying this, compare with the other NY Times version, where the roaster is butterflied and then marinated in buttermilk, garlic, peppercorns, salt, rosemary and honey.   Calls only half the salt, so go figure (or taste!). <a href=""https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/7264-buttermilk-roast-chicken"" title=""https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/7264-buttermilk-roast-chicken"" target=""_blank"">https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/7264-buttermilk-roast-chicken</a>.","1506866314","223"
"30561097","sophie","Best roast chicken I’ve ever made/had/seen!! Prepared this according to Samin a few times now and I’ve learned 2 days marinating is better than 1. And if you like a very crispy chicken, I’ve refrained from turning the temp down until it had ~10 min of cooking time left.","1549885599","162"
"22743753","MarciaSF","Easy enough and yielded a really moist chicken.  I don't know if it's significantly better than my go-to Zuni Cafe roast chicken recipe which uses a dry brine, but was interesting to try.  Do yourself a favor and line your pan with foil or make sure you've really scraped off most of the buttermilk.  What puddled in the pan beneath the chicken really burned and glued itself to the roasting pan.  Dish guy/husband was not thrilled.","1506870475","161"
"22748293","karen","I've roasted many chickens but this is the best!  I stuffed the cavity with a small Meyer lemon. While the chicken rested after roasting, poured the pan juices into a fat separator then added chicken broth. Meanwhile deglazed the iron skillet with dry vermouth. Then added defatted juices and simmered until rich in color. Delicious. ","1506870227","151"
"100023233","Aileen","Works well with chicken thighs. Can substitute yogurt. Can add harissa or other herbs. Can reduce any smoke issues by heating a cast iron skillet at 350 for 30 mins, then add chicken and continue at that heat.","1555369369","147"
"31506651","el","After reading the reviews I decided to go with heating the cast iron skillet in a 350 degree oven for 30 mins then putting the chicken and continued at that temperature.  Worked great with no mess or smoke detector issues. Chicken was fabulous.","1555077173","135"
"31522702","Claudia","Suggest marinating in a glass bowl to avoid single-use plastic bag. Better yet if the bowl has its own lid! Also I suppose if using cut up parts, the pan rotating will be unnecessary?","1555164373","124"
"31524325","Laurie Dunn","Can someone tell me how (or if) cooking time should be adjusted if I’m using bone-in, skin-on thighs?","1555176178","122"
"22487700","Geoff Last","I've roasted a lot of chickens in my day, this one is now my go-to. A few years ago I was at the celebrated Le Coq Roti in Paris and had an amazing piece of chicken. I asked the waiter what the secret was to getting it so moist and flavourful and he said he could not divulge this information but then leaned over and whispered ""buttermilk"". 12 hours or more in the buttermilk is ideal but I've done it for as little as 6 and the results were still great.","1506867886","97"
"110167054","Mary","I would like to encourage all recipe writers and those who make the recipes to revise this direction:   Place the chicken in a gallon-size resealable plastic bag.  How about place the food item in a reusable container with a lid? Let's stop adding unnecessary plastic to the landfills.","1605542703","82"
"30594523","Sarah","Wonderful! I added herbs and garlic to the marinade, and put butter and herbs under the skin before putting it in the oven, along with lemon juice squeezed over top with a drizzle of olive oil. Best roasted chicken I've ever had, let alone made.","1550032334","81"
"22278887","Erica","I made the NYT buttermilk, rosemary and honey recipe with bone in thighs and it was to-die-for.  The longer you marinate it the better!","1506866564","77"
"31527936","Tom","My freezer bags are not single use. I use them over and over till they leak. Wash them with soap & sponge, inside and out in warm water. Sit them upright to dry.","1555244942","76"
"22306941","Cheryl","Salted 2 skin-on boneless chicken breasts and left uncovered in fridge about an hour. Then placed them into a resealable bag with 1 cup of buttermilk which covered them. Marinated for 24 hours. Discarded the buttermilk. Broiled chicken 10-12 minutes each side til instant read thermometer was 165F. Result was plump, moist, flavorful chicken breasts. I'll make this again.","1506866210","75"

"31251825","Maria","Made exactly as written in iron skillet on bed of onion and sweet potato slices. Super moist and easy. Used a 6lb bird so increased cooking time and checked doneness with thermometer. Served with other NYT recipes: brown butter cornbread and herbed beans.","1553648716","58"
"22342446","Alyson","My sister made this; it was moist and delicious. Maybe the best roast chicken I've ever had. And it came out of the oven looking exactly like the photo.","1506867182","57"
"22279616","Dan Findlay","I make my own by adding a little cultured  buttermilk to fresh milk (1 Tblsp. per cup, or 1/4 cup per quart) and letting it sit at room temperature for 12 hours or so. Use skim, low-fat, or whole milk as you wish, or culture heavy whipping cream the same way for creme fraiche.","1506866292","54"
"22307684","fatmorejellyroll","Just made it tonight.  Trust the recipe, it came out great.  The detail about placement in the oven will make sense when it's time to rotate.","1506866265","48"
"22856632","Kay","I cooked this recipe exactly.  With my oven I had to tent the chicken and cook 10 minutes longer than suggested.  Whole Foods has great air chilled chicken.   The only thing that I did do  (thinking Barefoot Contessa) was peel and thinly slice a baking potato place in bottom of the cast iron pan add salt/pepper/olive oil/fresh tarragon and let the chicken juices season the potato. Really enjoyed this easy recipe.","1506871560","48"
"31515296","Anne-Marie","I just bought two bone in chicken breasts from Whole Foods.  Eager to try this but wonder how much time to allow.  Would really appreciate any suggestions. thanks.","1555102207","47"
"100020481","Dan","I have found that Saco powdered buttermilk is excellent in both cooked foods and baked goods.  It is convenient, less waste and k eps long in the rmorning fridge rat or...even longer in the freezer.","1555358734","47"
"30243413","Suzanne Shewcraft","I have roasted many chickens. This is by far the best roasted chicken recipe I have ever made. It also happens to be the easiest. We have just finished our 5th chicken prepared this way, and have 2 nice birds waiting in the freezer who will meet the same end.   I've roasted birds in the 5 lb range and just add a few minutes to each stage and check the temp at the end. We have twice let the bird go 2 days in the buttermilk, by happenstance, and they are just as good if not better. ","1547946080","44"
"31518717","AKNannie","** Safety Alert** In reference to comments regarding “leftover” buttermilk or marinade: If it’s the 2 cups that are “left over” from the quart you bought, yes. Use it for cake, biscuits, etc. But don’t use leftover marinade with raw chicken juices in it for anything. That's why you wash everything (with soap) after handling raw chicken. It will be on the pan, your spoon, your hands, etc.  And DON’T make ranch dressing  or biscuits with it. The word “leftover” was referring to 2 different things.","1555116852","44"
"100071262","Becki","I made this with only 6 hours marinade time and wasn't expecting much, but it was really phenomenal. So tender and the skin just shatters (butter tucked under helps!).  I recommend a salad situation on the side: extra buttermilk with herbs and pepper for the dressing, and toss old baguette cubes in the chicken fat and bake for the best croutons ever.  Toss with lots of fresh herbs, snap peas, lettuce.  Roast the chicken on top of radishes if you're feeling bougie. Such a banger. 10/10","1555612323","37"
"23226048","Phoenix","Paul, You may not like hearing each cook's personal variation on a recipe, but some of the ideas are fantastic. I learn a lot from the commenters here. Some suggest half the salt, or a third of the sugar, or wonderful additions to spark up the recipes. I love it when the commenters give their impression of how to improve the recipes and add their own flair. i don't like links to other sites. Just the personal experiences and suggestions are helpful to some of us. ME, for example.","1506875285","36"
"29383058","hz","Added a homemade preserved lemon in the cavity, a bed of sliced onion under the chicken, and multicolored whole baby carrots on the sides. The flavors were outrageously good; white meat was the juiciest ever!  Baked in my shallow round le creuset; cleanup was a breeze.  I recommend watching the 4th episode of the chef’s Netflix series (salt fat acid heat) to see how she salts the bird before marinating. It seems like a lot but the final result was not salty.","1542066833","35"
"23595923","Helen","Since I saw this recipe weeks ago, I've been making this every Sunday. It's perfect for my salads for lunch, chicken salad and even an evening dinner. I also make gravy in the iron skillet as well. <br/><br/>In fact, I made two this morning so to give one to my son. <br/><br/>I've never tasted a more juicy chicken breast ever!","1506880775","33"
"31529611","Aric","Tom just not with raw poultry. That salmonella sticks around.","1555259020","31"
"103468145","Megan","Regarding kosher salt quantity, her recipes are written for Diamond Crystal (red box). She says if you have Morton's (blue canister), which is twice as salty by volume, you should use half as much (thus 1T in this recipe instead of 2). Would be nice if this recipe included that nuance! May be the reason some people are finding it too salty.","1572816984","31"
"30242808","Peggy","Not sure it's a good idea to use any of the marinade for biscuits.  I'd be concerned that the temperature needed for the biscuits is not high enough and bake time not long enough to kill off any possible salmonella that could occur from the raw chicken.","1547943266","29"
"29962291","Britta","Hi Alan, you can try using a pre-heated oven safe skillet (cast iron is a good choice). Put the skillet in the hot oven for 15-20 minutes to pre-heat, then take it out and place the chicken on the hot pan. (It should sizzle) Compared to putting the chicken in a cold roasting pan, this method gives a head start on cooking the dark meat and should give a more even result. Good luck!!","1546402406","27"
"25061474","Barbara Wheeler","By far the best white meat from a roast chicken I've ever made. Marinated 36 hours, roasted in a large iron frying pan on a bed of par-boiled potatoes and quartered mushrooms and onions. The whole family--three generations--liked it a lot.","1512260796","25"
"30253222","David","Breast side up is traditional, but my sister start it breast side die so the juices flow forward the breast and then finishes it breast side up to get the crunchy browned skin (I think it's the l as 15 minutes).","1548012229","24"
"31524919","PNRN","Put a plate on top of the bowl, if it doesn't have a lid.","1555184894","23"
"22937565","Aidan","Delicious.  The only (tiny) change I would suggest is to place two 3/4 inch slices of yellow onion in the skillet before placing the chicken on top of them.  The onion acts like a rack, allowing the oil to drip away, and gives a nice flavor to the oysters.  I've also done this with pieces of white bread - but I seldom have white bread, and brown bread is too sweet.","1506872300","22"
"22311974","Susan","Prepped and cooked exactly according to the recipe, using an organic chicken and low fat buttermilk, it was absolutely delicious and perfectly salted. Served with rice and roasted asparagus with my home made hollandaise. Might cook about 5-10 minutes longer as it was just a little pink.","1506866300","20"
"31525530","Michael","20-25 minutes, flip then another 10.","1555194771","20"
"31510814","Mary O","Does anyone actually drink buttermilk? I buy lots, just for baking.   I am going to try this,  but with bone-in chicken thighs I just bought on sale. I figure, 40 min instead of an hour, should be enough.","1555089340","19"
"22319885","Katharine C","Marinaded as instructed, but in a covered glass bowl.  I forgot to pre-salt it for 30 mins but otherwise followed the recipe.  Delicious: crispy skin and moist tender flesh.  Will definitely make again.","1506866580","18"
"30025034","Mike M.","Look at the picture above and you ca see it goes breast side up. And no cooking question is ever silly!","1546812402","18"
"31521967","Joe","I drink buttermilk everyday and love it.  However, I don't think I would drink buttermilk (or use it for a dressing) that had been used to soak raw chicken overnight.","1555159806","18"
"22878341","sestree","An option so you don't have to turn it as often is to ice the breast after you take the chicken out of the marinade.  Ziploc bag with ice works nicely.  Makes the breast cooler so it does not cook quite as fast.  I've made a version of this before - buttermilk marinated chicken is a staple in the plains/southwest.  Easy, fun, and great for beginners as well as those who are more advanced cooks/chefs.","1506871969","16"
"100119616","katrinka","Used 4 thighs so therefore 1c buttermilk and 1/2 the salt recommended. It still took 40 min with 10 min rotation of skillet bc wasn’t sure how long was required. Did bake on bed of sliced onions and a bit of fresh rosemary. Picky teen eater said delish and apparently my cooking skills have vastly improved lately.","1555901775","16"
"22504501","tal","I made this recipe following the cooking instructions and really liked the outcome.  My buttermilk brine recipe has 2 tbsp. each white sugar and course salt, 1 tbsp. ground cumin, 1 tsp black pepper, 2 tbsp. minced garlic and a chopped shallot.  Marinating for as close to 24 hours as you can get is key.  I also pat my chicken dry with paper towels as I think it aids browning.","1506868918","15"
"29618149","Shulan","I wanted to try this recipe after seeing in on Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat as  it's been one of my goals to roast a whole chicken. It turned out beautifully. This skin was perfectly roasted and had an amazing flavor and the whole chicken was super juicy. It's a simple recipe, but lets the basic flavors shine.","1543942561","15"
"31524800","Penny Garcia","This is the most delicious roast chicken that I've ever cooked and believe me it's been a few.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.","1555183195","15"

I followed the recipe as described for a whole chicken.  I let it marinate overnight (about 14 hours) and cooked it on convection roast for the prescribed time.  It was wonderful!

"26775722","salex53","Yum. We'll be eating this frequently. Small helpful hint. Stand the ziplock bag in a deep bowl, and combine the salt and buttermilk right in the bag you'll use to marinate.","1523997363","12"
"29554485","Sue L","PS to my previous note: Last two times I made this I dared a tiny tweak & stirred a tsp. of Ethiopian Berbere spice* into the buttermilk before marinating ""da boid""--even better! *Readily available online, or use whatever combo of granulated garlic, ground ginger, ""sweet""--not hot or smoked!--paprika, ground New Mexico chiles, etc., pleases you.","1543440620","12"

"27775483","Sue L","This is--bar none--the only roast chicken method I'll ever need: It's infallible, whether you use a whole chicken and regular oven, a Cornish hen in the former or toaster-oven, or a poussin or chicken part of your choice* in toaster-oven. Unless you're a 100% novice, you needn't bother with all the oven-turning, although lowering the temp from 425 to 400° is fine. Just keep a watchful eye--and then gobble!  *Avoid breasts, though--even bone-in, skin-on, they'll dry out.","1531087958","11"

"30087816","Sharon","This turned out so delicious.  I had rosemary and thyme, so added some of both under and over the skin.  I also added a couple of bay leaves inside the cavity.  I had neglected to salt the bird before dropping it in the buttermilk, so I tossed a bit of kosher salt and pepper over the top before I popped it into the oven, which actually added a little extra crunch to the skin.  Oh my god.  I can't wait to make this again.","1547142138","10"
"30354299","Suzanne Shewcraft","I think the chicken is so juicy and delicious on its own that it doesn't need gravy. I have used the leftover buttermilk as the perfect excuse to make buttermilk biscuits. And I agree there is definitely a food safety issue with using the marinade. Buttermilk is cheap and keeps for a long time in the fridge.","1548608068","10"

"100438293","Terri","I have cooked this chicken many times. A few points to consider (maybe already previously posted): Do NOT use table salt, it will be terribly salty. And keep in mind that most grocery store chickens have already been ""plumped"" with saline solution. I buy organic chickens which are much smaller-3-4 pounds, and they do cook faster-yep they look like little tweety birds. The skin is always beautiful although not crunchy, however the meat is perfect.","1557585813","7"

"110494468","susans","2 days of marinating is better than 1.  Stuff the cavity with a small Meyer lemon. While the chicken is resting after roasting, pour the pan juices into a fat separator then added chicken broth. Meanwhile deglazed the iron skillet with dry vermouth. Then added defatted juices and simmered until rich in color. Delicious.","1607380952","7"

There's absolutely no difference in the taste of the skin because of the buttermilk; it's the 425 degree heat that makes it so crispy. If you want a recipe that doesn't use spices or a lot of work, this one will work. And FYI, there is no need to cut off the wing parts. Just put the whole thing in the marinade and oven.","1564438260","5"

"22773038","Judy","Followed this recipe to the letter and the chicken was perfect.  Will definitely do again.","1506871444","2"
"22891444","Paul","Nope. People can talk about whatever they want on here.","1506872330","2"
"23024579","Vicky","This works well with pieces too. I add some crushed garlic and hot sauce to the buttermilk for a little zip. Easy, but you must plan ahead for the time it takes to marinate.","1506873370","2"
"24796574","Flora","I may be in the minority but I found the buttermilk made the chicken taste peculiar. However, the breast meat was extremely tender and juicy. ","1510376786","2"
"27021353","Debra","Followed recipe but had no cast iron pan. Used roasting pan with shallow rack instead, Turned bird as directed toward back sides of oven which was vital to perfectly even, deep golden skin. Moist, buttery meat. Easy, interesting enough to make again.","1525808590","2"

"30400672","Tessa","@Peggy, good point. The biscuit recipe I use has the oven at 450, however, you're correct, the center of the biscuit might not get hot enough. Buttermilk straight from the carton for the biscuits would be better. I'm not worried about any bacteria surviving the gravy making process -- they won't.","1548873348","2"
"31510885","JKF in NYC","I roasted two Peruvian chickens on different racks--one center, the other in the top third. Halfway through I switched. Gave it more time and like Char, used the thermometer and checked the juices. It all worked beautifully. I suggest you look for the Times' Peruvian recipe too!","1555089557","2"
"100040718","Steve K","Less salt next time.  Did 4 TSP and was too much.  Maybe 2 TSp or none.  But it was excellent.  Marinated 4 chicken thighs for 24h.  Oven at 425 with cast iron pan in to pre-heat.  Shook off buttermilk.  Put pan on stove on medium and cooked skin side down for 3ish-4ish minutes just to crisp skin a bit.  Flipped it over.  Pepper on top and herbes de provence.  In the oven.  Our power went out and I over-cooked a bit but still moist and great-tasting.  A keeper, easy, and adaptable.","1555448836","2"
"100173351","Gluten free","I cook a lot of chicken as my husband and I LOVE chicken and I saw this episode of the series and tried it - “OMG I never need to cook chicken any other way again” - truly the moistest chicken you’ll ever make!","1556196400","2"
"100196878","Richard D","I made this last night and was very disappointed in the results. While the skin browned beautifully it was not crisp and was rubbery. The chicken was moist but the texture was very rubbery and tough. Could have been the bird that I used but I followed the directions explicitly. Any one else have these results?","1556296125","2"
"100217117","michele","Made it on Easter Sunday.  I marinated it in the buttermilk for two days, flipping it periodically.  It is the most moist and delicious chicken I have ever made.  As others have noted, it does not result in a crispy skin, but for me, the taste and tenderness of the meat more than compensates for this.","1556452870","2"
"100319113","JCM","I didn't use any salt (I use little salt in general). The buttermilk gave the chicken a wonderful texture. Browned well. Next time I'll add spices -- maybe sage.  Small chickens are available in my area from farmer's markets. They eat in the fields, not grain fed. The source of chicken might have contributed to the success of the recipe -- these outdoor, grass-fed chickens are very lean with a good (stronger than usual) taste. Will surely make this again. I liked it!","1556932489","2"

"102549065","kat","Simply wonderful. Also we cooked it but had to let cool,  then refrigerate due to enjoying to many appetizers and wine. We reheated in oven and it was still delectable.  Our Sunday Funday roast chicken from now on.","1568707394","2"
"106036558","cornelia","Among the small luxuries of being shut down during the coronavirus are the glorious meals that we’re having. Samin’s buttermilk chicken has been the height of our meals since the shut down — the appearance as it comes out of the oven deeply golden, every part cooked perfectly — moist and full of flavor. We raise our own roasting chickens each summer and last eve cooked up our biggest,  a 6 1/4 pounder. Thanks for making this time a little less harsh!","1585132281","2"
"106567858","DrPangloss","I am a BIG fan of Ms. Nosrat and made this exactly as to spec in the recipe.  Results: Tremendously juicy chicken that didn't taste like anything--very bland (and not surprising since it has no seasonings other than the salt).  Will not make again.  If you want something amazingly flavorful please try Colu Henry's Roast Chicken With Maple Butter and Rosemary here, Bittman's Simplest Roast Chicken (also here) or Ina Garten's Perfect Roast Chicken. All are easier, delicious, & less time consuming.","1587298406","2"
"106798484","Leslie","This is by far the most delectable and moist roast chicken I have ever eaten. I’m one of those cooks who usually can’t resist adding my own touches, (worked as a chef for 35 years) but, I followed others advice and didn’t succumb to the temptation. So interesting the instructions for oven positioning. After eating BOTH wings, the rest went into chicken and dumplings, enriched by the beautiful broth made from the carcass.  Really can’t say enough about how good this is.","1588277139","2"
"106907213","Wanda","This is so good!  I had a 5.5 lb bird. It took a total of 1.5 hours plus resting time. I did have to tent with foil as it was getting too brown. Took it out at 160 and it rose to 165 while resting. Perfectly moist, done, and delicious. I roasted in a Pyrex pan so clean up was easy. I added a few potatoes in 1 inch cubs at the start scattered around the bird. They were so delicious. I poured the pan juices into a bowl to spoon over chicken and potatoes.","1588813463","2"
"108869149","Ray","Sweet baby Jesus, that was far and away the best roast chicken I've ever had! Didn't tinker with the recipe in the slightest -- and there's no need to, given that the ingredient list is simply buttermilk, chicken, and salt. Saved the bones and scrumptious pan drippings for use in making chicken stock in the future.","1598642199","2"
"110077718","Lynne","This sounds interesting.  I think I'll try it this year with my Cornish Game Hen Thanksgiving-for-One, AKA Miniature Thanksgiving.  I'll let you know how it goes.  Your comments about removing the backbone making a turkey easier to brine reminded me of the year Mom and I drove from Los Angeles to Northern California, 400 miles, with a turkey brining in a cooler in the trunk of the car.","1605080302","2"
"110136543","Matthew","My husband and our girls thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.  Prepared true to form outside of the additional seasonings of thyme, rosemary, basil, grated garlic and onion, and paprika, we found our bird needed additional cooking time, well beyond the 1hr intimated.  To say it turned out well would be an understatement:  tender, juicy, succulent, flavorful - and received with no complaints is a rarity in this household.  We'll definitely be adding this recipe to the fold!","1605325129","2"

"110209219","ZW","Some friends and I made this for friendsgiving and it is virtually impossible to mess up. The simplicity of the ingredients hide the fact that the end result is AMAZINGLY juicy, tender, well-seasoned chicken with earth shatteringly crisp skin that is to die for. Honestly it reminded me of rotisserie chicken.   One thing I will say is that we spatchcocked the chicken after marinating and it didn't necessarily reduce the cook time but gave us really good results.","1605713582","2"

"110418661","Sam","I was scared to try this recipe, but SO GRATEFUL I DID. I had been using the same roasted chicken recipe from my mother-in-law for Thanksgiving every year. This was our first holiday without company, so my partner was open to an experiment when this came across my newsfeed. Recipe was easy to follow; I even made my own buttermilk. The results were tender, buttery, juicy, moist meat with the most crispy delicious skin! This is a keeper and we're making it for the in-laws ASAP.","1606943987","2"
"110439740","J in mclean","This is very good, not great. But, for the price of a whole chicken (s), it is not worth the effort.  Just buy a pre-roasted chicken. We could not see a difference.","1607039858","2"

"110753351","John M","I did 4 game hens according to this brining recipe, 2 each in big ziplock bags.  I was surprised how tasty and juicy it turned out, and my kids loved it too. I do think I will do it again.  I skipped the twine and oven choreography described, just slam it in there at 450 and forget about it.  Is there anything I can do with the buttermilk/salt/poultry effluvia? Seems a shame to rinse it down the sink.","1608820923","2"
