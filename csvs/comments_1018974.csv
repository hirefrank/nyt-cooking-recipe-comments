"24544124","Anthony","I made this for four chickens for a pot luck tonight. I separated each into breast/thigh/drum/wing before marinating cooking. Wasn't too fastidious either about patting off the marinade and also had a few less jalapenos than called for and subbed dry basil for fresh. Results were spectacular. Absolutely spectacular. And did I mention spectacular?","1508630036","713"
"24546480","CFXK","My substitute for cilantro is parsley AND some other flavorful herb (my choices are mint, basil, or lemon thyme, depending on the dish) chopped together.  Parsley alone is not enough (dull flavor), but chopping parsley in equal portions with a bright herb does the trick for me.  For those who insist (with a superior air) that if I just kept eating cilantro i will learn to love it, I gladly will do so when you commit to eating a bar of soap until you ""learn to love"" it.","1508668323","616"
"28046551","colormestacy","Didn't marinate for 12 hours because my boyfriend and I don't live together. I was cooking this at his place and wasn't going to show up in the morning to set up. We've been dating for almost three years, so we have talked about moving in together, but he wants to live in Brooklyn Heights and that's too far from work for me. Say what you want, but I also enjoy having my own space. Subbed honey with agave nectar because I'm a Millennial. Will be making again!","1532917217","224"
"24560099","William Fite","CFXK is correct. By some genetic mischance, a few people experience the taste of cilantro as soapy. Sometimes intensely soapy. Don't goad cilantro haters to ""learn to love it"" unless you are prepared to reprogram their DNA. As to Theabroma's (did you mean Theobroma as in Theobroma cacao?) condescending observation that parsley is no substitute for cilantro, know that there is no herb with substantial similarity to the flavor of cilantro. Just pick one that you like.","1508777546","208"
"24552411","Patience Finley","Used sriracha and chilli powder to replace the aji Amarion  paste and aji panca paste. Other than that, followed the recipe as it is. The chicken tasted fantastic, Very moist and well seasoned. Made the sauce Saturday night and thought it tasted mediocre. Sunday night took the sauce out, a miracle must have occurred overnight, it tasted brilliant- super creamy and full of flavor. But will cut the ingredients in half to make the sauce. The recipe yields about 4 cups sauce, too much for a 3.5 bird","1508717225","153"

"24561005","andythebeagle","I Love You, Alice B. Toklas!    I'm such a late bloomer.  I'm 72 and just discovered cilantro 2 years ago when a clerk in the Asian Market told me it was Chinese Parsley.  Trust me, it ain't parsley.  It is unique.  It is one of a kind.  I now put it in everything.  Even salads, any beans I do, and my son told me to try it on ice cream, I might like it.","1508779931","118"

Ají de Huacatay (Peruvian green spicy sauce) 1 hot chile pepper (Peruvian aji amarillo) 1 rocoto pepper 1/4 cup plain peanuts 1 cup of Huacatay leaves (fresh or frozen. If you use paste, adjust salt and vinegar to taste) neutral oil (canola, corn, sunflower, etc.) 1/2 cup evaporated milk 1/2 cup mexican cheese or mild feta 2 or 3 crackers (saltines or oyster crackers) splash vinegar salt and pepper to taste","1508779294","112"
"31311958","margaret","Absolutely do NOT wipe the marinade off before putting the chicken in the oven. If fact, I drizzle any marinade still in the bowl over the chicken so as not to lose any of that wonderful flavor. And I marinade the chicken for at least 24 hours. Why go to the trouble of making this delicious dish and do something to REDUCE the flavor? We make this at least twice a month - our favorite.","1553988226","103"
"30147801","Jane","I had this dish at many restaurants while living in Peru. Never once had “heat” in the sauce. If aji was used, it must have been very subtle. Cheese used was called “fresh cheese,” something akin to farmers cheese or Mexican queso fresco. We often saw the sauce atop gorgeous filets of sea bass as well. Heavenly!","1547487154","101"
"30138297","Bellaverdi","Big hit at my house. I did heed some suggestions from previous notes. I didn’t have access to the more exotic powders but did use shiracha and ancho chili powder as substitutes. Also, I heeded suggestion to make sauce without the feta, oregano, honey, but did add a bit of yogurt. I baked with 3 lbs thighs and added sweet potato rounds while cooking (I allowed  them a dunk In the marinade after placing chicken in pan). This is a do-again, and again","1547431984","87"

"27420018","Miriam","I never thought I would meet a roasted chicken that I love as much as this one!  The chicken is golden, tasty and juicy and the cilantro sauce seals the deal.  I usually make extra sauce and then toss it with any leftover chicken (fork-shredded) to make a spicy cilantro chicken salad.  Slap that on some toasted rolls with a tomato and sliced onion and it's lunch for the rest of the week!","1528737310","51"
"30134790","Patricia","450 degrees is high to roast a chicken with marinade, and if your chiles burned, they would be bitter. Cilantro stems are not bitter in my experience, and the literature supports this. Taste the marinade before using it, and if it's not bitter, lower the roasting temp to 400 and see if that fixes the problem.","1547399993","49"
"24546145","Uhura","The sauce has a brighter, unmuddled flavor without the dijon, honey, cumin or oregano I've found.   And, for a weeknight, a store-rotisserie chicken will do--very nicely--even in a pinch, the Costco ones. Some steamed rice or even fried potatoes do very nicely with this dish and sauce.","1508657857","45"
"24558859","Elizabeth Hills","Made this for a small dinner party I hosted last night and it got rave reviews. I couldn't find either of the chili pastes on my grocery shop, but did find dried, ground aji amarillo, and added water to make a paste. I had to dial down the amount of chile just a touch because the paste I made was HOT. It felt a little wrong to wipe off the marinade, so I half-heartedly wiped some of it off, but everything came out beautifully, and that green sauce is a winner. Bravo!","1508774273","41"

"24551654","Marc","Fermented wheat is an ingredient in producing soy sauce, so it can contain gluten, theoretically enough to trigger in someone with true celiac disease. Tamari traditionally is made without the fermented wheat, but there are exceptions. So it is worth checking the list of ingredients if there is a concern. Many producers are beginning to label the gluten-free soy/tamari sauces as such.","1508704169","28"

"30137161","Sue L","The chicken invariably turns out great, as written. About the sauce, though, I'd omit the oregano/basil, the feta, the honey, and the mustard, for a more authentic--and more rewarding--result.

"24550627","Uhura","Yes!! I completely agree! A little creaminess is all that's needed. This can be achieved with either with a little cotija (but then what do you do with all that cotija left over?) but a tablespoon of mayonaise or sour cream works. But no cumin, oregano, honey, dijon, that's for sure! The chicken too...way too fussy. I've no idea this recipe was written by someone who's ever been to Peru.","1508693925","17"
"25177168","Nina","Hi everyone,   I am Latina and when it comes to cilantro, it is a bit of a staple in our food but the suggestion to use mint and a few other ingredients as a substitute is a pretty good one.  However, I would caution some of the other flavor notes that your are going to use because mint does NOT work with everything.  Flat leaf parsley and fresh basil are another way to go.  Hope this helps.","1512937528","17"
"29145849","Melissa","At our local Peruvian chicken place, this sauce, along with a yellow sauce, is served with the chicken.  My favorite side dish is sweet potatoes sliced into rounds and baked, with this incredible sauce.","1540424374","16"
"30189496","Jeannette","For all the spice wusses, like me! Aji amarillo is more on the spicy side, sitting between 30,000 to 50,000 Scoville heat units. Aji panca however, is much more mild sitting between 1,000 to 1,500 Scoville heat units. ","1547669740","16"
"24552934","Maui Maggie","Think about it this way: street food often has meat with a topping of cilantro, jalapeno, some goat cheese, chili sauce and served with a wedge of lime.  This sauce is essentially a blender version.  I look at this recipe as a chicken taco sans taco.","1508725585","15"
"24563946","Karen","To CFXK, I've heard that using about 1/2 leaves plus 1/2 stems of cilantro kills the soap taste. Somehow the addition of stems does the trick.","1508789307","15"

"24562838","Penni Gladstone","Amazing flavor. Used 3 not 4 jalapeño. Heat was perfect. Make sure the oven is fully hot at 450. I only had time to marinate the chicken for 2 hours which was fine. Next time I'll put foil on the pan. The whole chicken was cut in half but next time I'll try pieces. Loved the cilantro. Xtra garlic of course.","1508785291","13"
"30146454","Martha Plaine","Tasty recipe. The sauce is similar to chimichurri - and so I think that for those of us who cannot eat cilantro (genetic, I have read in the NYT), parsley would work very well.","1547483673","13"

I don't understand why people always want to change a recipe to suit their tasts. It's much easier to just find another recipe.....cumin is a flavor all on its own and no substitution will give authentic results.","1508775433","11"
"24581457","Roy","A few things on this.  Maybe California Jalapeños are bigger than NY ones, but 3-4 is too many.  One big one was enough.  I've had this issue before with your recipes.    I only used about 1 oz of olive oil and the sauce was great.  I can't imagine why you'd use 4 oz.","1508878771","11"
"24585010","Jonathan","Added a half an avocado to make the green sauce a bit ""fluffier"" and it made it nice and creamy.  I bumped up the lime juice and cut down on the jalapeno because the wife doesn't like spicy.  It still had a nice kick and I served her some yogurt on the side to counter the spice.

One perfect version per recipe, and one where I swapped the basil and cilantro quantities - 1 cup fresh basil and 2 teaspoons chopped cilantro. Everyone was very happy. Served with roasted potatoes as well as a rice/corn melange which is what I’ve found to be traditional at every Peruvian restaurant I’ve been to in South America. We were on the fence about which side we preferred. ","1549725508","11"
"24558978","JessS","Made this last night, did not include the mustard in the green sauce but it turned out delicious! Would definitely make again. Used chicken leg quarters instead of a whole chicken and roasted at 450 for 35 minutes.","1508774583","10"

(Actually from Greece.) Fresh oregano I used a piece of roasted ancho chile I'd frozen from my garden last year instead of the paste. I used a good, light-flavored EV olive oil (I'm wondering if a strong olive oil might have caused the bitterness some people talked about? Have had that issue with homemade mayo sometimes.) SUPERB!

I make a dressing by squeezing the orange and adding a few splashes from my pickled red onions whisked with the green sauce. Toss everything together. Leftovers you actually look forward to eating!!","1623714025","4"
"115654810","Elaine","We love this recipe so much we decided to try it with a turkey today for Thanksgiving. Roasted the two halves in an oven bag for three hours, then removed the bag and let the skin crisp up even more. Melt in your mouth moist white and dark meat, and we could drink the cilantro sauce, it’s soooo good. Happy Thanksgiving!","1637907812","4"

With leftover chicken and rice warmed up, added marinated (pickled jalapeño juice, thank you Sam Sifton) halved cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, white beans, olives, lettuce, cilantro, basil, and that amazing green sauce over all…what I had on hand. Almost better the second time around. Melissa Clark rocks! Wish my avocados had been ripe. Next time.","1674518590","4"
"128110192","Mo","I made the marinade as written but modified the aji verde sauce a little after making it the first time. For one, I think a little mayo makes the sauce creamier so instead of 1/2 cup of olive oil I did 1/4 cup mayo and 1/4 cup oil. Also omitted cumin, honey and mustard as i haven’t seen that in other recipes. I think any hard salty cheese can be used in place of feta - Parmesan and cotija both work. The resulting meal inspired total silence at the dinner table, which is always a good sign!","1696092458","4"

"24822397","denisem","In Peru, black mint is used to flavor dipping sauces. So try substituting a combination of a little mint and regular parsley for cilantro. It won't be the same, but it will have the some of the brightness that cilantro adds.","1510609135","3"
"25107201","Curtis","Delicious! It’s a lot of ingredients to buy if you don’t have them around (which you probably won’t), but it freezes great in a vacuum sealer, so you can make dinner for a long time if you do the prepping thing. It’s also super impressive as a main course for a dinner party. ","1512517859","3"
"26430934","Kate Warren","It was outstanding. I’ll definitely make again.  I served it with black beans, your Arroz Verde and a mango salad. I did not use Feta (no dairy for me) in the sauce nor Dijon in either the marinade or the sauce. I added Huacatay to the marinade and another clove of garlic.   The marinade is so good that I plan to make a few more batches to share with my foodie friends. I think it would work well on grilled skirt steak or grillled prawns as well.","1521686984","3"

"30169002","Chef Carlos","Wow!  What a terrific recipe. I toned down the heat a bit and used sambal and ancho chili powder, not so many jalapeños though. Same for the sauce. But the chicken, the chicken. Amazingly good. I used a cut up 3.5 lb fryer since all the whole chickens were over 5 lbs. Another fantastic Melissa Clark recipe. Gracias ","1547575095","3"
"30175521","Karen","Sara, I marinated it for 24 hours, no harm.  It came out quite good, though patting dry the marinade removed more than I wish it had.  I had to broil for a few minutes at the end to get a darker color, mine was not nearly as lovely a shade as  the picture.  I used 2 large jalapenos in the sauce rather than 4. Overall, very good, deep smoky flavor, and not too spicy for my kids.","1547600132","3"

Added a mashed avocado to leftover green sauce and thought it was better, hubby thought I ruined it that it lost it's fresh green taste. Served it with roasted butternut squash tossed with olive oil, cumin, garlic and pasilla chili powder. Definitely a keeper. I'm going to try the marinade on salmon then grill it.","1548292447","3"

Then I put the marinated chicken in the oven. When I removed the chicken from the oven to rest, I put the asparagus in. I used the chicken fat for the potatoes. I had made the sauce earlier. Easy and so good! Everything done at the same time and ready to serve.","1553367074","3"
"104561720","Barbara Robertson","Ají verde is delicious. I think I could put it in a glass and drink it. When I have leftover sauce I have found it is great as a sandwich spread, on eggs, as a dip for veg, and licked off my fingers.","1578675654","3"
"107149392","Kate","My mom is genetically averse to cilantro, but I have found that some parsley with a splash of lemon juice will get you the bright freshness of cilantro, if not the exact flavor.  I have also had success doing a partial substitution, replacing most of the cilantro with the parsley/lemon mixture, but keeping just a pinch of cilantro in there to nudge your brain into thinking it's all cilantro. It's not enough to impart that ""soapy"" flavor to the whole dish, but you still get the spirit of it.","1589995630","3"

"115439527","Anonymous","I made this a few days ago. First I did it per the recipe exactly. It was good but lacking punch. Next time, I did a few things differently that resulted in a far superior dish:  1) use more of nearly every ingredient of the marinade, in particular the two Aji chili pastes. I think ""heaping tablespoon"" is more appropriate than what is written. Also twice as much salt.  2) add in a splash of dark soy sauce. Helps a ton with color and browning","1636651156","3"
"117133557","RDCollins","Outrageous! The sauce alone was worth the effort, good enough that I may make just the sauce again. Followed the recipe exactly, including using ají amarillo and ají panca (available from Amazon). I did make one small change, namely quartering the chicken (which is how we normally serve it). I used my wand blender to make the sauce and the marinade, which worked well. And I marinated the chicken in a sealable plastic bag. Cooking time was spot on.","1646017610","3"

"121872290","Charlie","Insanely good, and super easy to boot. Since half my family has the cilantro-soap problem, I subbed a mix of parsley and basil. I also used only 1 jalapeño since they aren’t as spice-tolerant as me, and also because the two spice pastes were pretty hot already. It was definitely worth seeking out the Peruvian pastes, they have unique flavors. I served it with pretty simple roasted potatoes, thinking that there would be plenty of sauce to spare, and I was not disappointed!","1670371776","3"
