"110897971","Fif","Have made this for 4 people this year. Singlehandedly soothed roommate relationship during dark period of quarantine; staved off a breakup at least 2.5 weeks. True rating is 4.99/5 to account for the time it falsely raised hopes of intense seriousness and perhaps love in a casual relationship.","1609817054","536"
"111606380","Shawn N.","60. Had ramekins. No joy. Gave them to Goodwill. Missed ramekins (creme brûlée!) so bought more. Found the box that never made it to Goodwill. Felt bad for having a ridiculous number of ramekins. No joy. Made this recipe. The joy is back","1613519252","528"

"111566985","Marta Frijole","Am 63. Own ramekins. Bought them on the sly many years ago (I was young then; am older now). I keep them off-scene, hidden away.  Why? Husband (67) believes they take up an obscene amount precious storage space. (He did buy crumpet rings, however, at the start of the pandemic). I will make lava cake. I will demonstrate the redeeming qualities of ramekins. I will fantasize about replacing crumpet rings with ramekins in the coveted drawer.","1613250504","304"
"30575683","Ali","I reduced baking time by two minutes!   Also, I bought some ramekins this weekend. Used them twice already. Everything I eat will be in individual serving sizes from here on out. ","1549938828","296"

"30591226","Nicole","They are perfectly safe to eat. A little bit of science: only 1 in 20,000 eggs possibly carry salmonella; salmonella is destroyed at 160*F; cakes are set at 200-210*F; and the internal temp of the lava cake reaches that magic number of 160*F.  Also, if you are basing this concern on being told not to eat raw cookie dough because of eggs, the truth is people were getting sick from the flour in the cookie dough, not the eggs. So you can have your cake and eat it too!","1550009415","210"
"30608094","Karen","The article above the recipe says you can use 2 - y ounce ramekins and cut the baking time to 7-9 minutes.  My first attempt was also over cooked.  7 minutes was a flop.  On the third attempt, I turned the temp down to 400, baked 9 minutes - perfection!","1550109301","162"

"30603730","AJO","Lava cakes? Chocolate volcanoes if you please, I’ve been using this recipe for over fifth teen years after my son saw them on a TV cooking program. “I bet you can’t do that Dad.” I found a recipe for it in a doctors surgery. My son was very particular which family and friends would have these for dessert only A Listers would get them.   Very easy to make and bake  I line the ramekin with buter and flour and find that they work best when quickly turned out after removing them from the oven. ","1550088909","106"

"30548666","Mike","I would rather have Ali's ability to improvise than ramekins. Ramekins - $10.49 for a set of 4 at Briscoes. Improvisation - priceless. ","1549752681","84"

"111536248","Valerie Nelson","I’m 65 with ramekins. I bought a set to bring this dessert to a dinner party back maybe twenty years ago. Ecstatic reception. Get the ramekins when you can. They make you look cool.","1613090058","65"

"30700961","SeeBeth","FWIW, we were too stuffed after our rich lobster dinner to have dessert. The notes say you can refrigerate the batter in ramekins/muffins tins/Pyrex dishes for up to 48 hours. Mine were refrigerated for four days but baked up to perfection. I left the ramekins out on the counter to warm up a bit while we ate dinner and extended the cooking time by a minute or two. For the life of me, I don't know why this isn't a 5 star recipe. Chocolate sinfulness...","1550622545","60"

"105151291","Brandy","I too have made this recipe for many years and it's fabulous. I've made them GF by using almond flour and they are still just as wonderful. My dishes hold about 6 ounces and i use the 12 -14 minute bake time. I use only butter on the dishes and run a knife around the inside before turning them out after about a 2 minute stand time. Did I mention fabulous?","1581442697","55"

"30609752","Stephanie","I let them sit at room temperature for about five minutes after baking to cool slightly so I could handle them and do the upside down thing. Worked great!","1550123797","44"
"106522725","Alex C","This is an amazing dessert in all its forms. ., overbaked, hot, and -left-in-fridge-overnight-and-is-now-basically-a-truffle. I am now out of chocolate during the coronavirus, but maybe that's a good thing because me and my husband are getting real chubby.","1587071194","43"
"111571334","H","Am 21. No ramekins and a college apartment in a virus lockdown so all I had for chocolate was chips. Muffin tin and chips worked wonders. Someday I'll aspire to ramekins when I'm not a minimum wage paid TA sneaking into the NYTimes with the help of a grandfather.   For now, my roommate and I forget about the virus via an IV of chocolate lava cake.   P.S. a doubled recipe made 6 muffin tin sized cakes, which were in the oven for 8ish min.","1613273087","40"

"30647203","Deb","I made this last night and successfully converted it to be both gluten and dairy free. I was nervous but it came out perfectly! I subbed in coconut oil for butter and gluten free flour for the flour. Same quantities. I also used coconut sugar instead of regular sugar and subbed fiore de sicilia for vanilla.  Very forgiving recipe. Delicious, easy and impressive. I used small ovenproof bowls since I did not have actual ramekins. Served with a dollop of coconut yoghurt.","1550262935","29"
"115654086","Priya","My daughter is making this recipe right now. Frowned and asked “what’s a ramekin?” I started laughing and now I’m afraid I may not be getting a lava cake tonight.","1637891142","27"
"30657362","Jason M","I used two 6 oz glass ramekins and refrigerated for about an hour (Val. Day dinner). I placed on a cookie sheet on low rack. Checked at 12 mins still not done enough. Took 15 mins. Lesson learned: place directly on a rack. Very tasty. Garnished with conf. sugar and fresh blackberries. Surprisingly easy and pleasing.","1550341755","26"
"111003914","Queen of Schmaltz","Frankly I'm surprised at disappointed by the lack of fact checking by NYT. This cake not only tastes nothing like authentic lava (trust me I know, I've been to prime lava spots all over Europe), the recommended baking temperature is not even close to getting it as hot as lava.   Delicious for a chocolate cake though!","1610227291","26"
"111186346","Mrs. Little","I have made this twice this week because its SO good, and so simple. The first time I made it exactly as described. The 2nd time, I subbed 1/2 of the vanilla for pure almond extract, and I replaced the ramekin dusting of granulated sugar with cocoa powder.  Also - in case anyone without the fancy, traditional white ramekins happens to use pyrex/anchor glass food storage - the small 1 cup containers are oven-safe.  That's what I baked mine in!","1611185347","24"

"30655878","Beverly K","I cooked this as written except for used 60% chocolate.  I prepared it before dinner and let it sit at room temperature in six ounce ramekins.  As soon as dinner was over, I put them in the oven for 9 minutes.  They were perfect!  I served them with whipped cream and got rave reviews.  I will definitely make this again!","1550331938","22"
"111529960","BigRed","Love the ramekin discussion!  We chose some Royal Worcester ramekins as a wedding gift fifty years ago this month.  Loved them then, love them now.  Always elevate their contents- even if it is store bought tapioca pudding.","1613064238","22"
"30655987","Helen","I'm confused:  Why the ""no chips"" instruction, as it gets melted anyway?  I have Callebaut 72% in chip form -- is there any good reason not to use it?","1550332387","21"

Made for lunch.  Followed recipe exactly.  Baked 12 mins.  Delicious. Will make again.  Maybe breakfast tomorrow.","1613945831","20"

"111591557","Noah","28 years old, no ramekins, but I baked it in a Pyrex 4-cup measuring cup and it worked to perfection. (The Pyrex website says its ovensafe, and of course the glass is built to withstand heat changes.)   Delicious -- and it's just so easy.","1613435842","18"

"112129373","pb","Made these for my second solo-COVID-19 birthday. Figured  I shouldn’t go two years in a row without a birthday cake. Had ramekins as I fancied myself an accomplished dinner party host in the Before Times. Appreciated another reviewers tip that if you’re using 6oz ramekins it’s about 125g of batter per. That’s spot-on. Added a touch of cinnamon with the chocolate. Baked precisely 8 minutes per other’s comments. Perfection! Bonus - have the second ramekin for tomorrow night’s post-birthday cake.","1616521894","17"
"30559028","Phil","Terrific! I used a pair of (clean) cotton work gloves to lift the ramekin off the plate. A light spray of water, light, gives them a bit more grip.","1549849246","16"
"111702856","Heather E","This discussion on ramekins is hilarious. I grew up, in the 90s, watching food network shows. So of course one of the first things I bought after college on my own at 22 was ramekins! I still have the Nigella Lawson Choco Hot Pots recipe saved, which is very similar to this one. But seriously, I use ramekins all. the. time. They are great sized prep bowls, for cracking eggs into, for small children. Creme brulee, lava cakes, and I've even used larger sized for individual shepherd's pie or potpie","1614042130","16"

"30613560","Nancy","I am making this to bak tonight. All right to put it in the fridge in the ramekin? I believe in upsizing as we age. More room and fun to have parties","1550155743","15"
"30696731","Clara","Doubled the recipe as I wanted to make it for 4; but found that the quantity would have been perfect for 6.  Used Lindt Doux 70% and found it a bit sweet; next time would use either less sugar or 90% Intense ... my French crowd declared them 'superbe' .. will definitely make again.","1550607072","15"
"111682883","Spring","I'm over 30, so I used ramekins.  I doubled the recipe for our family of 4 and served with cooked and strained raspberries (basically unsweetened coulis) and lightly sweetened whipped cream.  The result was delicious, but so rich that none of us finished the cake.  Next time will make a single recipe and use 4 smaller ramekins (I'm way over 30, so I own a few different sizes ;-)","1613933855","15"

"106263467","Ella","Just made these tonight for my family- it’s an excellent Quarantine stress bake, as it’s nicely portion and quick to come together for chocolatey comfort. While I know that lava cakes aren’t exactly “cool” anymore in the foodie scene, sometimes you need chocolate cake in half an hour, and that’s what this recipe is. I served it with fresh whipped cream, spiked with a little coffee liquor. A wonderful treat!","1586047112","14"
"124239473","kellyckpdx","Then: I bought a set of ramekins I loved. In my excitement unwrapping them, I removed the label that said “DO NOT REMOVE UNDER PENALTY OF LAW.”  Now: they’re after me.

"116774318","DC","Purchased ramekins 5  years ago and never used…until yesterday. This was easy and so delicious! I made double (enough for 4 ramekins) to experiment with different temperatures and how it would be fresh vs from in the fridge.  Notes: -fresh batter: 425 for 9 min is perfect to give formed outside and gooey inside (from fridge 11 min gave same result) -no difference in taste from fresh and refrigerated so feel free to make ahead  10/10","1644184417","13"
"117246809","Alicia","I don’t understand why people are talking about ramekins as if they are required tools for Older  Age.  Everyone knows that God invented Bundt pans for that purpose entirely. (55, have 6.  Despite husband’s protestation, collection is growing steadily.)","1646588511","13"

"30546802","Bryan","OK, maybe I'm missing something but how can you get a firm enough grip on the ramekins to lift them up and off the flipped over cakes?  My oven mits, even using two (one per hand) did not allow me to lift off. Instead, they slipped back down, busting open the cakes. Is there some secret trick I'm missing? ","1549734131","12"

I waited 30 minutes for it to get closer to room temp, and cooked it for 14 minutes.  I should have refrigerated it IN the ramekin. The batter developed a crust on top, and mixing it before transferring would have broken the fluffiness achieved from whisking it. Also, would have waited longer for it to come to room temp.  It was too runny, and didn't hold its shape when turned out.","1550210385","9"

I look like an amazing cook!!!!","1551666772","9"

Last time I made this, I separated the batter in half since this recipe could really feed 3-4. Found my bf eating the refrigerated batter the next day. He thought I had made chocolate fudge. Honestly, it wasn’t bad.  My only issue with this recipe is that it’s so quick and easy to make, I find myself whipping it up late at night and then not sleeping after all that chocolate and sugar :’)","1670553010","9"

Bought new ramekins because you have to have them even if you have forgotten why.  Now I know why.   Had some release issues so I guess I will have to make them again!

Perfect size to have a snack with a cocktail; plus, keeps one from overindulging in yummy but-not-good-for-you treats.","1707953439","2"
