"30778406","Maria","To everyone asking ""where's the curry"" or ""how much curry,"" the term curry doesn't refer to a specific spice blend, but rather to a style of food in some aromatic sauce that goes with rice or bread. In some curries, the flavors are cumin, coriander, turmeric, etc - in this one, they're ginger, garlic, basil, and miso. There are about a million types of curry, and no two taste exactly the same.","1551076235","981"
"100730294","ChelseaJean","This was quick, easy, and delicious! Big thanks to all the notes here‚ÄîI followed others‚Äô suggestions and used a full can of coconut milk, about 1 C water, doubled the garlic & ginger, and threw in some lime zest. I also used bok choy instead of spinach because it‚Äôs all I had on hand, and it was great. I added the bok choy about 1 minute before the salmon, which I then cooked for 4 mins. I‚Äôll do the same next time I make this, which will be soon!","1559270857","597"
"30782007","maria","Whole family loved it.  Some changes: 1) Inc the garlic & ginger a bit - personal preference  2) Add a few dashes of curry powder while I saut√©ed onions, adds a little complexity - also preference.  3) Deglazed the pan w a splash of white wine after the miso was done - this really brought the miso together w/ the other ingredients for me  4) Inc the coconut milk as others suggested to 1 - 1 1/4 cup. Brought liquid up to only 3c total w water.  5) Used 1lb Patagonian scallops - so good in this!","1551107987","253"
"30779283","Annya","In light of other notes I used only 2 cups of water and otherwise followed all the instructions exactly.  It has a delicious but mild flavor and was a big hit. I think the key is caramelizing the miso; all of a sudden at about the 2 minute mark as instructed the pan started to smell wonderfully when that started to happen. If you add the liquid too soon it‚Äôs easy to see that this could fall flat.","1551096678","226"
"100074757","Barrett","One of the few recipes I crave enough to make over and over again. After several tries, I've learned the best adjustments are 1) use the whole can of coconut milk, 2) use less water (I just refill the coconut milk can from the tap), and 3) add some heat, like a glug of sriracha. The first two are essential, the third is personal preference.  If your fish comes with skin, make sure to remove it first (or better yet have your fish monger do it).","1555623437","184"
"100330357","Lilia","This üëè is üëè amazing üëè. (If for some reason emojis don‚Äôt go through, there are claps in there for emphasis.) My boyfriend was so worried about liking this and then couldn‚Äôt stop complimenting it! Everything comes together so perfectly. I used light coconut milk (1 c to 2 c water), upped the ginger and garlic for more pungency and was liberal with the fresh herbs at the end. Added broccoli and green beans for additional greens. Is it shameful to lick the bowl?","1557017536","108"
"30777359","Lisa","I added 2 tsp curry powder, doubled the ginger, changed the liquid to about a cup of water and a can of coconut milk (full fat) and threw in a sliced jalape√±o. It was delicious. We‚Äôll make this all the time.","1551061220","80"
"100758017","Amy","Tasty and very easy. Definitely reduce the amount of water and increase the coconut milk 1:1 would have probably tastes much better. Too watery with 3 cups","1559480524","76"
"30855300","mhenry","I couldn‚Äôt find white miso, only brown miso. Obviously changed the color of the dish, but it worked fine. Also, I reduced the sauce for an additional 10 minutes before I cooked the salmon. It made the flavor of the sauce much more concentrated and delicious.","1551465971","68"
"100204678","Olivia","So delicious! Added some fresh lemongrass I picked up today, plus extra garlic and ginger and it was great! Make sure you really caramelize the miso really well, to the point where it has darkened in colour and has caramelized the bottom of the pan. I find this is closer to five minutes than two. Be careful of the salt with this as the miso is very salty as it is. Really convenient and flavourful dinner!","1556324149","63"
"30817453","rebecca","I really enjoyed this easy curry.  My changes: I added 1 tbsp. fish sauce, used Thai basil instead of Italian basil, and used 1 cup coconut milk and 1.5 cups water for the liquid.  In addition to adding the herbs and lime juice at the end, I also topped the finished dish with sliced red fresno chile to add some heat.  I served the curry over cilantro rice.  A tasty and fast weeknight dinner.","1551290233","62"
"30826126","Bicka","Loved this.  After reading a lot of notes, I decreased the water by half.  Next time, I will go down to a cup or so and increase the coconut milk to 1 1/2 cups.  Also increased the ginger and garlic.  Added red pepper flakes to give a bit of heat.  Next time I will add a minced pepper in the first step.  The lime juice at the end is necessary.  Adds a nice fresh note.","1551331532","47"
"100760294","Melonie","Just made this for the third time using frozen wild salmon (coho? sockeye? Not king) from Costco. I used a whole can of coconut milk, and replaced the 3 cups of water with a coconut milk can full of shrimp stock I had in the freezer, and added a dash of red pepper flakes. Absolutely delicious. Using the stock made the biggest difference, increasing the depth of flavor to a whole new level. It was very rich with the whole fat coconut milk. I think it would be fine with light.","1559490696","45"
"30793777","AP","Fantastic! Great notes all - upped the ginger/garlic, added a sprinkle of curry powder, used bottled lime juice, full can coconut and one cup water, and hit it with some sriracha. Really good - keeper, want to try this with frozen shrimp as 1.5 lbs of salmon is expensive!","1551153961","36"
"30789366","Cat","Additions & Adjustments: I added 1 Tbsp. Curry, 1 cup of full-fat coconut milk, 3/4 cup water, 2 serrano chilis-diced, 1 cup diced bell pepper, 2 diced baby boy choy, 1/2 cup cherry tomatoes, 5 oz. fresh spinach.  End result is a richer, bolder flavor of coconut curry.","1551130808","35"
"30776693","Elle C.","Great umami flavor! Followed recipe with a few modifications based on what I had on hand: ie. tilapia, yellow onion. I used only 2 cups of water & 1/2 coconut cream (which I prefer over coconut milk) and added a dash of crushed red pepper. I tasted it before adding the cream and it reminded me of miso ramen. The coconut milk/cream really brings out the savory/umami flavor in this dish. Recipe calls for basil, I'd recommend thai or holy basil (rather than genovese).","1551050638","24"
"100668753","Hnedak","This is one of the best Times recipes I have ever made. Can‚Äôt wait to try it with other seafood. The addition of thinly sliced Serrano‚Äôs is wonderful. I amp up the ginger and the garlic, but otherwise would not change a thing.","1558907750","22"
"30777810","Judy","Delicious. Added a little more coconut milk and only 2 cups water. Next time maybe 1 1/2 cups water. It was a winner.","1551065738","21"
"30860681","SiouxsieQ65","Made this tonight. Oh my word, it's a keeper. Doubled the garlic, and used a generous helping of powdered ginger instead of the fresh. Bringing home a fresh bouquet of basil on a snowy night was worth every penny; the car smelled heavenly all the way home.","1551495193","21"
"107956572","me","So delicious and rich.  Realized this was definitely a keeper when my husband exclaimed, ‚ÄúDear God, please tell me this is an actual recipe and not something you threw together!‚Äù  ‚ÄúReal recipe‚Äù means it‚Äôs repeatable, ‚Äúthrew together‚Äù means delicious, but not always repeatable :-).","1593982754","21"
"100180124","Mary","This delicate curry was delicious! Plus, it was really easy - a great ""fancy"" weeknight meal. I did make adjustments per other's recommendations: -double the ginger -double the garlic -2-2.5 C water  -whole can of Coconut Milk -2 seeded & chopped jalapenos (Serrano pepper would work well, too. sauteed with onions/garlic/ginger) -juice of 2 limes plus wedges for serving (1T was not enough!) -let onions/liquid mixture reduce about 10 minutes -serve w/sliced jalapeno, soy sauce, red chili flakes","1556216223","20"
"30817093","Matthew","Granted, there are hundreds of ways to make a ""curry"", but for me, this recipe isn't one of them. I found it far too mild and milky for my taste, and lacking any of the flavors I was expecting. I added two tablespoons of Thai red curry paste to push it closer to what I hoped this recipe would be. It is more like ""aromatic coconut soup with salmon"" as currently written.","1551288201","18"
"30824114","Michelle","Used chicken broth instead of water.  Added red chille paste for some added heat.  Used shrimp and smaller scallops instead of salmon.  Super tasty!","1551318560","18"
"30866549","Sharon I.","I too increased the amount of coconut milk and used the whole 13.66 ounce can and 1 cup of water. Great flavors. The sliced jalape√±o is a must. Delicious! Can't wait to try it with prawns.","1551553961","17"
"30765832","Nett","I made this for dinner tonight and we think it‚Äôs a keeper. I also used red miso and accidentally doubled the coconut milk. Because of the extra coconut milk I added only two cups of water but next time I‚Äôll use half the amount of water because it seemed too soupy. With brown rice it worked fine. I added a chopped sweet red pepper to the broth when I heated it to boil and tossed sliced scallions on top along with basil. It was a beautiful dish and presentation.","1550966667","16"
"30832634","Jon","That was my observation as well.  More coconut cream (whole can) and less water.  I used yellow curry paste to give it a curry flavor, somewhat like Tom Ka Gai.","1551370995","14"
"30982002","Cuyler","Very happy with the recipe after I tripled the ginger, doubled the garlic, halved the water, and used the whole can of coconut milk.","1552180190","13"
"100763437","Kathy","I added a bit of brown sugar and some fish sauce to jazz it up.","1559524831","13"
"100765093","Janet","Bok hoy instead of spinach 1:1 coconut milk to water Add more ginger, garlic, fresh herbs Lime zest in addition to lime juice","1559538241","13"
"30895984","Claire","Took others‚Äô advice and increased garlic and ginger. I also used the whole can of coconut milk and 1.5 cups of chicken stock. In addition, I added a tablespoon of gochujang paste. Even my non-salmon lover devoured it. I prefer a bit spicer, so I hit mine with a drizzle of sriracha. Wow! Will definitely make again.","1551749545","12"
"100440486","TB","This is a lovely, easy recipe that makes for a very enjoyable meal. I thought 3 cups of water was a bit much so I cut back to 2 1/2 cups, then reduced quite a bit to get more flavor, next time I‚Äôll try with less, 2 cups. Adding the spinach on top of the salmon pieces makes it difficult to incorporate without breaking up the fish, I transferred the fish pieces to a plate before adding the spinach to the sauce, when done pour over the fish. If you like spice, Thai chile sliced on top is üëç","1557597122","11"
"30783680","Melonie","We enjoyed this. It's a great use for the frozen sockeye I get at Costco. I doubled the coconut milk, and added only 1 cup of water. Next time I will reduce more, as the salmon and spinach loosen the sauce a bit. I added a bit of fish sauce and will again. Served with sriracha, it was a hit.","1551112678","10"
"30867947","Jane","Wish I had read everyone‚Äôs notes before making this.  My instinct was to increase the coconut milk and reduce the water.  If I had read the notes I would have followed my instinct; my result was too watery, but flavour was lovely.","1551565611","10"
"30789569","Cookie","Decrease water to 1 1/2 to 2 cups.  Add a little curry powder. Use any fish. Deglaze Pan after carmelizing miso with wine?","1551131642","9"
"30828250","Eloise","It‚Äôs hard to know which is best, thus curry‚Äôs deep savoriness or the poached salmon‚Äôs velvety texture. Win/win. I used a whole can of coconut milk and about a cup of water. Next time I will add bok choy and will definitely try it with shrimp.","1551357179","9"
"30896360","MsMcK","I‚Äôm not sure where the motivation is coming from for cooks who change up this recipe so much - this is more of a curry in the Thai spirit of the dish. It‚Äôs amazingly simple & delicious just as it is. I used wild Coho salmon to keep the dish leaner & the broth from getting too oily. But didn‚Äôt make a single change. All four of us - 6 & 9 year old included - gobbled it up. YUM!","1551751903","9"
"100116141","Greta","The term ""curry"" truly means ""a spice mixture."" The curry powder you can buy in a can, like Madras; is only one type of curry. There are thousands of different combinations of herbs and spices from cultures across the globe that can be defined as curries.","1555867449","9"
"30797771","Wildmann","And added tofu at the end","1551192807","8"
"30809352","Joan","This is definitely a recipe you can play around with.  I made 1/2 recipe using .6 lb. Pacific cod, yellow miso, 1/2 can full fat coconut milk, 1 c. water.  Added a pinch of cayenne, next time I'd use more.  Used close to 4 oz. spinach, served over brown basmati rice.  I agree with many of the writers that the flavors can be upped.  Next time more garlic and ginger, maybe some jalapeno.  Quick and easy sauce, could have many different proteins.","1551237567","8"
"30850511","Bill","I‚Äôm a novice cook ‚Äî how do you remove the skin on the salmon before cooking?","1551450680","8"
"30792660","abigail","A ! Lovely, light, and luscious‚ÄîI could eat this every night.  Added a little more ginger/garlic, a tsp or so of green curry paste, red pepper flakes, thinly sliced jalape√±o, and some zucchini rounds (which my boyfriend tells me is sacrilegious, so sorry to the purists out there). Upped the coconut milk and decreased the water as suggested in the notes. I used light coconut milk and nothing bad happened!! Might add more green curry paste next time, definitely needs a little more spice.","1551146449","7"
"30869538","Beth B.","Made this with 2 cups water, more coconut milk (or coconut milk glob that was at top of the the can) a teaspoon or so of crushed pepper flakes, and one elephant garlic clove (2-3 times the size of a regular-sized clove). I didn't taste the miso at all, and was glad I used less water. You could substitute white wine or vermouth for the water and that would give the dish more flavor.","1551579017","7"
"30875669","Diana T","Delicious, we'll make it often. I doubled the garlic, as someone suggested. I only had 3/4# of salmon, but, otherwise, made the whole recipe without the rice. But where is the curry? I added about two tsps of yellow curry paste. Yummy. It was a salmon stew and the two of us ate it all.","1551631268","7"
"30881234","Linda P","Really delicious! Incorporated tips from previous posters with great results: increased the garlic and ginger, added minced jalapeno, a bit of red chili paste, used the whole can of coconut milk, and 1 cup chicken broth. And extra lime at the end. Will definitely make again.","1551699208","7"
"30804887","REC","Followed others advice and used full can of full fat coconut milk and 2 cups of water. Perfect even for my husband who it not a fan of coconut products.","1551217385","6"
"30827456","Tokyo Tony","Too much water.  Also added some curry paste after tasting the sauce during step 2","1551351037","6"
"30929333","ckim","I doubled the miso and used 2 cans of low fat coconut milk with a cup of water and it came out delicious! Also I found that the salmon is most tender when I added it to the curry and only cooked on med low for about 1-2 minutes then turned the heat off and covered until ready to serve. My salmon chinks were smaller than 2 inches so they were more bite sized. Enjoy!","1551908486","6"
"30934218","Julie","Soooo delicious! I used a whole can of coconut milk, about 1/2 cup of chicken stock, and maybe 3/4 cup of water, and subbed dried basil in during the miso caramelization (rather than fresh at the end). YUM.","1551932798","6"
"100346395","Jade","Boiling miso will kill the probiotics but it won't kill the flavor! You could eat another fermented food (kimchi, yogurt etc.) alongside if you're looking to add probiotics to your diet.","1557153890","6"
"30765778","Mike Pod","3 tablespoons of oil...but only 2 in the recipe. Wherefore art the third?","1550966254","5"
"30792256","Elizabeth FS","I made this almost exactly as written and it was loved by my family.  Just added double the coconut milk and only 1 cup of water. But we like a really creamy rich sauce. The flavor was delicate and wonderful. The lime at the end and cilantro/basil is important.","1551143927","5"
"30826734","Anne C.","That's a suggestion I will follow. Being able to use the full can of coconut milk makes more sense that using just 1/2 cup, plenty of water and then you have the rest of the coconut milk on your hand...","1551339495","5"
"30955994","Pam","Amazing. Saut√© the onions a bit longer, add only 1-2 cups water, and make sure the sauce has the desired taste/consistency before you add the fish because it cooks quickly.   This was so good my husband said he would eat it as a vegetarian dish. When the 2yo, 4yo and 5yo sat down for dinner, it was complete silence as they devoured it.","1552031783","5"
"100576132","Denise","I made this with flounder, and it turned out great. I followed another cook's note about reducing the water to 1 c. and that was a good tip. I ate it over rice and didn't add any additional salt while cooking, since the miso already contains salt. However, we did have to add some after the food was plated.","1558397406","5"
"100761573","harveytb","use a full can of coconut milk, about 1 C water, doubled the garlic, and throw in some lime zest. fish stock instead of water? hot pepper flakes","1559498903","5"
"100761712","Sharon Lansing","NYT Notes:  Use a full can of coconut milk, about 1 C water/broth, double the garlic, and throw in some lime zest. Also, add curry past for a more robust flavor.","1559500510","5"

"30774612","Darien","How much curry?","1551031174","4"
"30777339","gp","I also used red miso and doubled the coconut milk - delish. Will add a little spice next time, curry paste or red pepper flakes to the broth.","1551060951","4"
"30783286","delicious!","We substituted fresh cod for the salmon but otherwise made as written and it was delicious!","1551111556","4"
"30810082","Fiona","1 cup coconut milk 2-3 cups water A little less miso.","1551242328","4"
"30859936","Teri","Tried this dish tonight. Instead of cooking the salmon in the pan, I marinated it and grilled it to lay on top of the dish. Needed more spice/ heat. Will add maybe red chili pepper flakes, a little of the Mexican lime seasoning and add stuff to taste. White wine in place of water. Overall, a clean dish. Love the basil and lime for added favor! Definitely a keeper!","1551490281","4"
"30880301","Cindy B","Delicious if you use entire can of coconut milk and white wine. Def use jalape√±o and to keep it low carb I used shiritaki noodles. Next time may add green curry paste with miso. Excellent!","1551672712","4"
"30887105","Toni","Made this yesterday and it is delicious! I increased 1/2 cup coconut milk to full can and added enough water to equal 3-1/2 cups. This would be a great dinner party dish.","1551719218","4"
"30980283","michelle","This was amazing! Added some kaffir lime leaves and slow roasted the salmon in a 250 degree oven as mine came with skin-on and I figured it would be easier to remove it after cooking. Just delicious.","1552165735","4"
"31092707","Adelle","This was an absolute win! Followed the other cooks‚Äô suggestions and used the entire can of coconut milk and only a little bit of water. The whole family enjoyed this dish, it‚Äôs a keeper!","1552778023","4"
"100453895","Dhw","I agree that the dish needed some slicing up:  red pepper flakes, more ginger, more lime‚Äîbut it was delicious!  The next day, leftovers and the broth was even more flavorful.","1557743818","4"
"100770906","Jan","We couldn't get enough of this!  I made this last night, taking into account the comments about the ratio of coconut milk to water: one full can of coconut milk and 1C fish stock instead of water.  At least doubled the ginger and garlic and added three whole dried thai chilies to steep in the liquid while it reduced.  Finished with lime zest along with the called-for basil and cilantro.  This will definitely be in our regular rotation - super easy and so flavorful!","1559575417","4"
"112290752","Chelsey Marx","to avoid killing all the wonderful probiotics naturally occurring in miso, I recommend taking a cup of the heated (NOT BOILING) broth into a bowl, whisk in the miso, then pour the miso/broth back into the curry. Try to do this step last after everything has been cooked so the miso keeps all its wonderful health benefits <3","1617621813","4"
"30760889","Barbara","Very good and quick. I used red miso because I had no white. and double the recommended coconut milk because we love it. Next time, I'll reduce the water and consider flavoring it with some kind of curry spices. Terrific recipe to use as is or play with.","1550935940","3"
"30767775","Kristen","This was fabulous. Doubled the coconut and lime.","1550979374","3"
"30768658","Doug","Definitely too much water, even letting it reduce for 10 minutes. I agree with Nett and Barbara that adding more coconut milk and 1 cup water would give a thicker, more flavorful broth. And yes to curry spices!","1550987798","3"
"30786908","Jenna O.","A very light curry, but good flavor overall. Next time I'll definitely try a white fish and add a little heat.","1551122608","3"
"30792057","Meg D","Yum!!! Double sauce, only use 2C water, add saut√©ed mushrooms and canned bamboo shoots.","1551142796","3"
"30792675","Alex","I made it with the skin and it came out fine! I really like salmon skin though.","1551146510","3"
"30793235","Natasha","So delicious! My family loved it and it is so easy to make. I too increased the coconut milk and decreased the water. Next time I will add a little spice. So lovely!","1551150276","3"
"30832590","Jon","It is a paste made from fermented soybeans.","1551370882","3"
"30845779","Sarah","Made this tonight with salmon, and it was amazing. The only thing I tweaked was the ginger....somehow got distracted at the grocery store and bought pickled ginger. Cut it up to 2 tablespoons and couldn‚Äôt tell the difference. Overall this dish was really flavorful, and light. I got my white miso from Whole Foods delivered through prime since it wasn‚Äôt at my local grocery store. Saved an extra trip.","1551415794","3"
"30854652","Beulah","This is surprisingly easy.  The picture and description sounded really good, so the minute I saw wild salmon at a local store, I got busy.  Everything else was on hand, since I make pretty much weekly trips to a local Asia market.  Even a bit of yellow miso, which worked just fine. I had frozen brown rice, so just threw that into the pot. It is a very quick and easy, and reasonably healthy, delicious meal. Wild salmon, spinach, brown rice, ginger, garlic, coconut, fresh herbs? YES!","1551463290","3"
"30854736","HOC","I made this exactly as instructed. Really bland. Needs spice.","1551463600","3"
"31007895","David C","Love. The miso adds salt, umami, sweetness and thickens the sauce to boot. Makes an easy & delicious coconut curry base that would really accommodate almost anything. Adjustments: tripled the ginger & garlic, substituted bok choy for spinach, reduced water, increased the coconut milk, added Thai chilis and jalape√±os, put in three bunches of Thai basil to cook with the fish, added two cooked, cubed sweet potatoes. Cilantro and lime at the end are critical to add freshness & acid to taste.","1552364791","3"
"108213089","Jeri","Big thanks to all the notes here‚ÄîI followed others‚Äô suggestions and used a full can of coconut milk, about 1 C water, doubled the garlic & ginger, and threw in some lime zest.","1595171451","3"
"110157494","Ian","If you follow this recipe as written you get a bowl of hot water with some onions and ginger floating around in it. 3 cups of water does NOT work.","1605496698","3"

"30788421","Elle","I would.","1551127738","2"
"30801016","Robin","Wonderful and easy meal. Sophisticated enough to serve to company. Will try  next time with scallops. Followed others advice and used full can of full fat coconut milk and 2 cups of water. Perfect even for my husband who it not a fan of coconut products.","1551202224","2"

"31076574","quaasam","Ok. Nothing special. Made it with salmon and shrimps. Too watery. Reduce the liquid content.","1552674002","2"
"31135669","Victoria","This was very good, I used a can of coconut milk and only 1 cup of water. I added lime leaves and jalape√±o.  It needs a little heat.  I would definitely make it again.   I found 5 minutes to be too long for the salmon and I used Swiss chard instead of spinach.  Next time I will use Serano peppers more ginger.   It‚Äôs a really nice dish.","1553057563","2"
"31192677","Blake","I followed the advice of some of the others in using less water and more coconut milk.  If you do this, though, it's going to need a bit more acid to balance it all out.  Perfect with generous squeezes of lime.","1553309454","2"

"31311988","Aimee A","This is not a good recipe. 3 cups of water is far too much, and produced a thin, diluted, brown-ish broth that was highly unappetizing. Considering the prep time and number of ingredients involved, it is hard to believe the resulting flavor was so lackluster. I would not recommend others make this as-written, and even with modifications, I think the concept if flawed.","1553988538","2"
"31339394","Rebecca","This recipe is a keeper! I made the following modifications: 1. Full can of coconut milk 2. 1/2 cup of water 3. Shallots instead of onion  I first put the salmon in the oven and broiled it for about 5 minutes, then took it out and let it rest.  Before I added the salmon to the curry, I let the sauce reduce for 15 minutes on a low heat, it really elevated the flavors and made for a more creamy texture.","1554168960","2"
"31414245","Ila","Great recipe. Doubled the ginger, and added a splash of fish sauce as well as zest of one lime. Through in some diced green chilies into bowls for those who wanted the extra heat. Excellent!","1554511097","2"

"31512571","JB","The salmon curry is what you prepare in the first part of the recipe, with the spinach, salmon, miso, coconut milk, ginger, garlic, etc....","1555094635","2"
"100214134","Kim","Loved this, but found it to be a little too sweet for my taste.  Next time might swirl the miso in after I add the liquid to the pan.....  I also used more coconut milk/less water, and added the extra (half a can) to the liquid I used to cook the accompanying rice.  More ginger and cilantro next time!","1556410176","2"
"100338849","Sanna","This recipe is so tasty and filling, it's definitely one I will add to my normal rotation. The only thing I will change next time I make it is searing the salmon first to add a little crunch. Amazing!","1557088684","2"
"100562138","Vmaria","This was very good and it comes together fast. I followed the suggestion to use 2 cups total liquid. I used the whole can of coconut milk and just added enough water to get 2 cups. It would also go well with some kind of spicy topping.","1558319150","2"
"100760590","Anne","use a full can of coconut milk, about 1 C water, doubled the garlic, and throw in some lime zest.","1559492011","2"
"100761415","Jane","Made this for lunch with canned salmon because that‚Äôs what I had on hand, and I couldn‚Äôt wait to try the recipe. Had cooked, shredded collards on hand too. It was wonderful! Can‚Äôt wait to make again following the recipe more closely, although it‚Äôs clearly a versatile dish.","1559497531","2"
"100761957","Sumi","It's not really a curry is it?  Miso is fabulous.  I agree that 3 cups of water is too much but it makes it into a broth dish.  Second time I used 2 cups dashi with 1/2 cup of coconut milk and added chopped scallions instead of cilantro and it was a wonderful Japanese fusion dish.  I can see adding other things to this like bamboo shoots.  Thanks for a good idea.","1559504422","2"
"100762523","Greg","My wife and I loved this soup. Like others whole can of coconut milk and less water. I love the lime juice, so I doubled it.   If you are doing keto, this is perfect, tasty enough to satisfy, the salmon give a good serving of protein. We skipped the rice, it was filling without it.","1559516738","2"
"135830015","Carolyn","2x garlic, 3x ginger, no extra salt, 2 tsp red curry paste, browned 5-6 minutes to release flavors, whole can of coconut milk, 3/4 cup of water, red pepper flakes and ghost pepper powder, reduced for 5-6 min, let sit for an hour off the heat before bringing back to a boil and adding salmon (really let the flavors come together), 2x the lime juice and added lime peel to aromatics. It was AMAZING!!! Glad I read the other reviews before making","1725031692","2"
"135866145","JP","This was fantastic. Mild, yet delicious flavors.  Will make again. I agree with others in reducing the amount of water to 1-1.5 cups and use a full can of coconut milk. I would add another veggie, maybe sliced red peppers. It may need a little kick of heat for some people. You could also vary the fish, IMO.  The question I always have is WHY WHY WHY doesn't the NYTimes add water as an ingredient? I mean, it's an ingredient in this recipe! Yet water is not listed. This bugs me.","1725188013","2"
