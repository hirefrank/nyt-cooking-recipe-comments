"31423006","stephen","Caramelized onions freeze well. After I harvest onions in the early fall, I set up a table next to my gas grill. I put a big skillet on the side burner, add some oil. I cut up three pounds of so at a time and toss them in the skillet.  Doing it on a breezy day keep the tears and smell at bay. After several batches, I let the caramelized onions cool and fill snack size Ziploc bags. Three bags fit into a quart freezer bag. They keep all winter.","1554584660","1359"
"31295675","Jim","A friend pointed this recipe out the other day and it fit the bill for a perfect, Lenten Friday, lunch. The wife approved with double thumbs up.   My one tweak: I deglazed the pan with some bourbon. It's something I usually do if I am caramelizing onions. It's adds a nice vanilla sweetness.","1553877696","598"
"31411931","biesstie","Made these with homemade tomato soup and thought they were great. We had leftovers, so I made myself another soup and sandwich, but added some minced fresh dates to the onion and heated them again in a little butter.   Wow! The very slight bitterness of onions was transformed. The added specs of sweetness to the combination of crisp bread, silky melted cheese and savory onions elevated this already excellent sandwich to something REALLY special.   Give it a try.  You’ll like it.","1554497731","391"
"31420247","voelteer","As Natalie notes, getting the water out is essential for caramelization. One trick I learnt from another commenter on another recipe is to spread your sliced onions on a plate, cover with a paper towel, and zap in the microwave for two minutes. Doing so takes some of the moisture out of the onions and reduces the time needed for caramelizing.","1554566674","302"
"31209187","Christa","I love Ali Slagle's recipes, and I love caramelized onions, so what a great combination on a cool, rainy, early spring weekend afternoon. Deglazing the pan with sherry vinegar took this dish over the top, as did some leftover Emmi Roth Le Maréchal cheese. Genuine comfort food, and easy to make, too. I can easily imagine making this on a weeknight. Whole Foods' ""bits and pieces"" of leftover ends of cheese make it possible to purchase just a small bit of some really interesting cheese.","1553455580","246"
"31240950","Heidi","I love making this if I have the time to caramelize the onions. My super lazy version of this is to buy a good onion jam, and spread that inside the sandwich with a good cheese.","1553610628","186"
"101452513","susan","Try buttering the bread instead of the pan.  Does a better job of getting the butter right where you want it.","1563125805","174"
"31495821","Gail","I make my carmelized onions in my Instant Pot. It takes about the same time as using a skillet, but it doesn’t have to be watched and stirred. I put 1-2T each of butter and olive oil in pot on sauté, add 2-3 lbs sliced onions and sauté until onions are coated, the pressure cook for 25 minutes. Quick release then sauté again until liquid has evaporated (5 min+-) and the onions are golden. No burning and very easy.","1555003180","152"
"31503204","Alexandra","I live in Russia and real Gruyere is hard to find and crazy expensive here, so I used some not so fancy cheese and common onions (we don't have varieties sold at stores) — still turned out super delicious and super French. It's amazing how 20 minutes of cooking in butter can transform the texture of onions and make them a sophisticated dish.","1555048902","128"
"100288621","Brian","I realized that I didn't have bread but did have corn tortillas- so this became a DELICIOUS quesadilla.","1556812425","116"
"31317928","Sage","My husband grills the bread slices on both sides on a buttered griddle first, then adds the cheese to one and puts the second slice on top of the first. This way the bread is good and crispy outside and inside but still moist inside (don’t overdo it). We also add different types of cheese. Best GC I’ve ever eaten!","1554046981","92"
"31294101","JimC","Used Publix (sorry New Yorkers its a Florida thing) Five Grain Italian bread and a well seasoned cast-iron skillet.  Mixing the grated cheese in with the caramelized onions before spreading on the bread is genius. 10/7 will make again.","1553873095","88"
"106100748","Molly","Added balsamic vinegar to the caramelized onions. Used a thin layer of mayo to cook the sandwich which made the bread golden and perfectly crisped. I had extra cheddar and American in my frig, which I added. I'm staying home to help 'flatten the curve' - this sandwich was like a warm hug. Since I can't have human contact this was a good substitute.","1585359495","80"
"31318894","KatPat","Just FYI, many experts caution against trying to caramelize sweet onions (like Videlias).  I don’t know why they say this (having been cautioned, I’ve never tried to do that), but cheap yellow onions caramelize beautifully.","1554052565","60"
"31422688","Kristin","The ""bits and pieces"" suggestion is a great way to keep this meal from costing a fortune or having to figure out what to do with a bunch of gruyere. I may try fig pieces added in or fig balsamic to deglaze.","1554582629","58"

"31320284","Natalie","Sweet onions have a lot of water in them and take longer. It takes me at least 45 minutes, but I love the taste.","1554071174","32"
"31432664","Jim","I love mayo in place of butter.  I also put a touch of mustard in the cheese.  Not enough to recognize the condiment, but enough to know something else is thete.","1554684416","32"

"31420253","Ruth","Always butter both sides of bread before cooking, and put into a buttered pan. Lots of calories, but guaranteed to be glorious.","1554566692","30"
"31321751","Constance White","Yellow onions have more nutrients also. My favorite addition if a thick slice of ripe tomato.","1554091218","25"
"100240209","Cinda","I cooked this over the weekend for my son and several of his college-aged friends. They loved it! I reduced the onions by almost half, and I deglazed the pan with dry sherry (adds a lot of depth to the sandwich). I'd make this again. The one thing I have to perfect is getting all the cheese inside the sandwich melty. Anyone tried covering the pan to get all the cheese to melt before the bread gets too dark, or would that take some crispiness away from the toasted bread?","1556576513","22"
"106439023","megs","If you have any of the onion/cheese mixture left it can become a delicious dip with the addition of sour cream and a little mayo.","1586795287","17"
"100269968","janisani","OMD this is transcendent!  The onions take time and patience.  I would probably double them next time and stash some in the freezer for another day.","1556730272","16"

"100357396","Lori B","1 1/2 tsp Better than Bouillon is genius!  I used half ementhaler and half gruyere plus a bit of balsamic vinegar.  Make sure you have enough cheese, maybe a bit more than in the recipe.  Used Mayo for toasting, gives a crisp, but tender crust.  Also used a Trader Joe’s sliced ciabatta.  It’s like a bowl of French onion soup in a sandwich!  Worth caramelizing onions ( which I did overnight in my slow cooker)!","1557189469","11"
"106001138","Chris Raftery","This is a great recipe. We've made it twice now,  and it was delicious each time. The first time we followed the recipe exactly. the second time we caramelized the onions with a couple of star anise pieces added and deglazed the pan with vermouth. In addition to putting the the onion-cheese mixture on the bread we added two thin slices of prosciutto. Baby! Oh, baby! Really good with the onions and melty cheese.","1585008743","11"

"105989785","Tim","Cutting a round of parchment paper the size of your cooking pan and resting this semi-permeable membrane over the onions (using the lowest-possible flame) also results in excellent caramelized onions.","1584979674","9"
"31458574","Etta Abrahams","Used white French bread. Substituted dash of balsamic glaze for vinegar. Had no problem with extra liquid from vidalia onion. Butter a must thought it adds calories. Made three sandwiches so we each had half of third. Grated gruyere in grater of food processor. Served with green salad. We both loved it. A “keeper” most definitely.","1554824259","8"
"31490800","Cat","Used French table bread, yellow onions, sherry vinegar, and buttered the bread instead of melting in the pan. Good, but... WAY too many onions! We found the cheese/onion ratio to be way off - and didn't even use all of them! Next time I would cut back on the onions, maybe even by half. Still, interesting twist on a grilled cheese.","1554987120","8"

"31426559","Adrienne Boswell","I think my heart leaped out of my chest when I saw this.  I love caramelized onions! I make grilled cheese with white cheddar and swiss. I can't wait to make this.","1554631712","7"
"106106426","Vivian","This is a delicious recipe that easily makes 4 sandwiches and not two. I reduced the butter by half to brown the sandwiches and made one at a time. The ""optional"" vinegar is a must. It balances the richness of the butter and cheese.","1585409430","7"
"106129480","JenSeattle","This made for a nice break from our traditional grilled cheese while we’re quarantining. I used cheddar instead of gruyere and it worked fine. (Looking forward to trying with gruyere when we’re shopping again!) One note: I was using regular sized sandwich bread. I doubled the recipe as I was feeding four people, and the filling made 6-7 sandwiches. Next time I’ll probably just make the single batch of filling for four regular-sized sandwiches.","1585518506","7"
"31358417","Les in Austin","Disappointing. Yellow Onions and red wine vinegar with Le Gruyère on a home-made whole wheat seedy bread. Could’ve been the onions or my cooking skills. A simple Boar’s Head pepper jack grilled cheese sandwich is better and easier at this point.","1554244469","6"

"115379821","Linda G.","I have been making this recipe since I first noticed it over a year ago. I use the cranberry flax bread from the supermarket bakery. The first time I made this, a lot of onion and cheese fell out when I flipped the sandwiches. After that I decided to just grill the individual slices of buttered bread, with cheese on half the slices. I spoon the onions (reheated—I caramelize them in advance) on top of the cheese and then add the top slice.","1636329415","4"

"119566424","Liz","I have made this for years and absolutely love this combo. One recipe I found a while back suggested a thin layer of grainy mustard on the bread before adding the cheese and onions. It is unbelievably delicious!","1659062054","3"

"128962755","Rosalind","I made this while waiting on hold with the insurance company! Plenty of time to caramelize onions and it kept me from getting cranky. I used whole wheat sourdough which is sturdy and worked great; also smashed the sandwiches down some while cooking to make them more like a panini.   Used a different stronger type cheese and it was delicious. I never thought of grating the cheese. Good tip.","1699210388","3"
"104821307","NancyKelley","Another alternative (Or even to accompany The sandwich) is French onion soup. Carmelize the onions until they’re a deep golden brown and add generous splashes of red wine along with beef Broth. Then just cut up some French bread and toast it in the oven, pour the onion soup into a crock and top with the toasted French bread smothered in shredded Gruyere. A few seconds under the broiler and you’ve got a taste of heaven.","1580002818","2"
"120341337","Donna","This was really really good, but way over the top rich.  I used sour dough bread which I think added a little tang (along with the small amount of sherry vinegar used to deglaze the pan).  I did need to add more butter than called for to fry it properly.  One half a sandwich along with a salad or light soup would be a more normal (and healthy) serving.","1662845357","2"
"132855925","BobD","I love this recipe and have made it a bunch of times with my home-baked bread.  Last time I added chili-crisp to the onions and that took it to a whole new level.","1714321622","2"
