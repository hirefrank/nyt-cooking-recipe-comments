"101118469","Jay","For those interested in cooking the recipe but who (like me) don't use ""converted"" (parboiled) rice, I suggest you could substitute 2 cups long-grain rice and 2-1/2 cups of stock.","1561469689","431"
"102181246","obinna","I’ve made this three times now. My thoughts:  1) solid recipe with superior flavor and great balance. My wife is in love with this.  2) to me, a Nigerian, this doesn’t exactly taste like jollof. In facts it’s probably the least “jollof” tasting jollof I’ve ever had but it’s still delicious  3) recommend cooking on stove as opposed to oven. You will achieve the slight burn to the bottom which provides excellent flavor. I cooked it between 4-5 on electrical stove for 30 min, then left covered 10","1566648930","325"
"101129780","Prakash Nadkarni","Good recipe, but I doubt Ms. Komolafe's claim that smoked paprika substitutes for the caramelized rice that's obtained by stovetop cooking. Iranian cuisine uses caramelization for chelo rice: the delicious browned bottom crust, the ""tahdig"", is savory-sweet rather than smoky. I'd use a wide non-stick pan instead of the oven in step 4, and after the stock is absorbed, set the heat to low (2/10 on electric heat) and cook lid-on for 30 mins unattended.","1561497670","263"
"101185187","david","I made it with three cups of basmati rice - didn’t change the recipe and came out great!","1561739166","156"
"107934370","Pierre","I've probably made this about a hundred times since this recipe was published.  It has become a staple of my cooking, and one of my favorite recipes to make.  I love how spicy , I love how tomato-y it is . It's just so delicious, all of it.  The sweetness of the onions really work well here, I usually make more than what the recipes call for because everyone end up fishing for more onions.   It's honestly a delicious dish. And I love this recipe.","1593748118","141"
"101118740","Roak","The wording on the rice ingredient isn't precise: parboiled long-grain rice, basmati or jasmine rice.  If I use basmati, do I parboil it? If not, reversing the sequence would be clearer: basmati, jasmine or parboiled type long-grain rice.","1561470288","127"
"101556693","Lilian","Raw chicken will give the rice that 'raw chicken' smell. Rice absorbs the flavors around it, so unless you want that, nah. Whenever I add chicken to a rice dish, I make sure to braise it in its own liquids first (pan, no water, medium heat) until browned. Bone-in preferably. Then I add it right after the tomatoes/peppers/spices, and reduce the heat until the chicken is coated. Then I add the liquid (broth or water), and then the rice, and cook as directed here.","1563556699","84"
"109081980","Ayanfe","I would swap the turmeric with nutmeg, then add some curry powder and thyme. Also cook on the stove!  Yet to meet anyone who doesn’t like jollof rice. Whenever I have a party and serve it, some of the non-Nigerians want takeaway, the rest are to shy to ask because when I offer, it’s a resounding yes. For the Nigerians, the takeaway is a given. My point is, if you make this dish for a party, the custom is to make enough that your guests can have takeaways.","1599883026","80"
"102802108","Edward","Wow. This rice is a total flavor bomb. It's like Mexican rice but full of smoky flavors and warm spices and heat and onion and garlic and ginger! Wow. Wow wow wow","1569811143","72"
"114106835","Caitlin","My twelve year old son made this for dinner tonight to celebrate the sale of my first novel on Friday. It was about the best thing I’ve eaten in forever. Perfectly salty and tomatoey and such depth of flavor from the herbs and garlic and chicken broth. Amazing.  Tomorrow I want the leftovers with some sliced avocado and a fried egg on top!  We served ours with some simple lemony herbed grilled chicken thighs and an all frisée salad.  I feel very feted.","1629070774","72"
"101209483","SamSam83","Yewande Komolafe has a wonderful video on NYT IG page which demonstrates the cooking process. Regarding the use of smoked paprika, she explains that it is used to mimic the smoked effect obtained when cooking over an open fire. It is not for caramelization.","1561848014","59"

"101141200","Barbara","I've made Jollof rice for years on the stove.  I can't imagine using the oven in the heat of summer.","1561563373","47"
"101925771","naio","This dish was incredible! I made it to go with the Peruvian Roasted Chicken recipe because my family loves saucy, flavorful rice with roasted chicken - swapped the habanero pepper with 1/4 teaspoon of aji amarillo paste in the obe ata to keep the flavors consistent, and it was amazing! Thanks for a great recipe.","1565376627","46"
"102236679","Janis Afotey","I have cooked jollof both the traditional way and in the oven. This is, by far, my favorite way to prepare jollof. I used jasmine rice. I found the one habanero chile to be insufficient. It didn't bring the heat that traditional jollof does. All in all, this is a very good recipe.","1566957213","37"
"108701784","Marcella","This is an excellent recipe! Don’t be dismayed if you don’t have parboiled rice, I used regular jasmine with no modifications to the liquid ratio and it was perfect. I made the full obe ata recipe and halved the rest, using one cup of obe ata in the final dish. The ratio of 1.5 cups rice:1 cup obe ata:1 cup broth yielded perfectly cooked rice, and I’m picky. Out of necessity I did use jalapeño instead of habanero, a whole one gave it a mild spice level. Delicious!!","1597810603","21"
"104344056","Rachel","Sauteed shrimp are awesome alongside this rice.","1577507920","18"
"104481457","EricJM","For OBE ATA:  1 tin (approx. 400 grams) Whole peeled tomatoes in juices (vegetables as listed would be same) 30 ml Canola or vegetable oil  For JOLLOF RICE:  118 ml (4 ounces) of Canola or Vegetable oil Onion & Garlic as listed 15 ml of tomato paste 5 ml dry tumeric 1.25 ml paprika (optional) 708 ml long grain rice of choice, but parboiled short grain works fine. Spices and herbs as listed 472-474 ml (16 ounces) stock.  Heat oven to 175 Celsius, or Gas Mark 4 (Moderate)","1578372863","17"
"108069400","Barbara","I've been making this on the stovetop for years.  Living in the South, it's a no-no to heat the oven during the summer.  A half cup of oil is a lot. The dish is delicious with only a tiny amount of oil for browning.","1594404828","17"
"106130926","Bernice Glenn","The recipe I have is from <a href=""http://www.congocookbook.com/rice_recipes/jollof_rice.html"" target=""_blank"">http://www.congocookbook.com/rice_recipes/jollof_rice.html</a>. While the basics are the same, this recipe includes cinnamon, curry powder. Vegetable added in along with the rice: sweet green pepper chopped, string beans or green beans, green peas,carrots, chopped, cabbage, chopped. 4 cups of rice are added but only 2 cups of broth, so it seems as if this is parboiled rice, or else more liquic would be added. I cooked a simplified version.","1585527435","16"
"101187782","stephanie","or, you could buy them, like almost every other herb that comes in both fresh and dried. my grocery store has bay leaves in clamshells just like thyme, rosemary, etc. if yours doesn't, you could purchase them online. or, just use dried. i don't find a huge difference myself, but ymmv.","1561744880","15"
"107158382","ERH","This was wonderful - richly flavored but not too spicy! I made all the obe ata but planned to cook only 1 cup of rice, so I added the tomato paste, turmeric and paprika to the pan before cooking down the puree in Step 2. Used part of the resulting sauce to cook the rice and put the rest in the freezer for later! I used brown jasmine rice and since I was unsure about the timing for the oven, I just made it in a saucepan - it took about 10 minutes longer than usual. Already excited to make again.","1590033704","14"
"107512044","Audrey Claire","I just made the obe ata (added tumeric and paprika) and stewed with some shrimp and plantains. It was really good but very spicy. Served with yogurt and honey to mellow out the heat. I stirred some of the leftover sauce in Greek yogurt for a tasty vegetable dip. Also plan to spoon some over ricotta on toast. I look forward to making the obe ata again and trying the full jollof rice recipe.","1591721267","14"
"111412986","Shari","We do this basically as written, but in the final 5 minutes of the 'let sit' we add raw shrimp and let it cook in the rice. Big hit.","1612396725","13"
"108146343","Heather","I made this with brown rice by cutting the amount of rice a bit and adding a little more water/broth. It came out fine, but I found that the heat of the pepper obliterated the other flavors that I was looking forward to tasting: turmeric, thyme, bay. I love heat, but I might try this again by seeding the pepper, or adding only half the seeds.","1594836202","11"
"127090363","TJ","The trick is to make a triple batch of obe ata, then freeze the extra. This saves the hassle of having to shop for and pre-make the obe ata every time. Plus then you can use it for other dishes too. We’re having jollof made with frozen obe ata tonight!","1692293145","11"
"114068036","Andrew McGowan","This not what ""parboiled"" rice means here. ""Parboiled"" refers to a pre-treatment also called ""converting"" rice. A process that gelatinizes starch and preserves thiamine is undertaken before milling. In the USA at least such rice if often marketted as ""parboiled"" or ""converted.""","1628779976","9"
"108376743","Karen","Just saying....one of my most impressive house plants here in NY, on Long Island is my Bay Tree!  Bought 7 - 10 years ago in a 3"" pot it sits in a sunny window during winter but goes out side for a solid 1/2 day of full sun!  A slow grower it develops into a well branched tree some 3' around & 4' tall. I have repoted w'new organic soil every other year. FRESH Bay leaf is obviously easy to find in any area that stays above freezing but here in Zone 7/8 it's a lovely houseplant!","1596031776","7"
"108416497","Sophie","Great dish! I had wanted to try cooking it since I finished reading ""Americanah"" and I am very pleased with the result. I ate it with fried plantains, next time I'll try boiled eggs.","1596212783","6"
"109246137","Jacob","Are you using enameled cast iron? You might have better luck on the stovetop if your cookware has poor heat retention- this recipe has been pretty foolproof for me.","1600793048","6"
"127619049","Lydia","I used someone’s tip about non-parboiled rice (2c. rice, 2.5c. stock) since that’s what I had in my pantry, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Worked great! It doesn’t taste quite like jollof I’ve have before, but it’s still really tasty, with surprisingly sweet undertones and a nice bit of kick from the habanero.","1694281710","6"
"101717470","Celeste","Just found out that our ancestors came from the Nigerian / Cameroon area in Africa.  Made this dish for our annual 'Cousins"" Get-together.  Everyone love it.  The only change I made was from Habanero to Serrano and Jalapeno peppers.  They provided a nice heat but not over powering.  This was a crowd pleaser!","1564449698","5"
"107712491","Xmaya","Yes. I did, turned out beautifully.","1592780242","5"
"107835228","Dani","This recipe was phenomenal! I’ve made this rice on the stove before, but it always ended up too dry. Cooking it in the oven makes for an overall more consistent texture and perfectly cooked rice. Yum!","1593368929","5"
"108098623","Natasha","I've made this today and this dish came out SUPERIOR!!! I did half this recipe of obe ata and used about 1 1/2 cups of stock and 1 cup of long-grain rice indica. Very delicious, but I think it would be even better if I took actual half the amount of rice that is in the recipe (that is 1 1/2 cup). I agree with people who said that you can substitute parboiled rice with not parboiled one without changing the recipe but be careful with the liquid ingredients (regular rice may demand more stock)","1594584816","5"
"114169067","Jenise","I make it Ghanian style with seafood (shrimp, clams, broiled fish) on stove-top for my partner. I saute the shrimp in the oil first, then remove it. Seafood is added at the end. I use a whole can of paste for a deeper red coloring and tomato flavor. The obe ate gets 2 or 3 habanero peppers. If you have an African store nearby, pick up some dried fish or shrimp powder. Nutmeg also enhances the smoky flavor. I only use jasmine rice.  He does love that browned rice on the bottom!","1629465209","5"
"116867584","Luther","Insanely good rice recipe. Followed the recipe with two minor exceptions, how it was cooked and no parboiled rice. Fixed the OBE ATA earlier in the day. When fixing the rice used basmati. Beef stock which next time I will use low sodium. Cooked everything in a large deep skillet on gas cooktop. Removed cover after 30 minutes cooking at medium low. Very thin layer of rice was deeply browned which, when mixed with rest of dish gave everything a magnificent flavor. Thanks Ms. Komolafe!","1644589828","5"
"125811231","Meg&Tom","This recipe is outrageously delicious as is. I also made a “southerned-up” version and added celery and diced green pepper along with the sautéed onions, plus a handful of cooked diced bacon. Our family loves it. Next time I may add more ginger - I love the fragrance of it as the tomato sauce simmers on the stove.","1687226279","5"
"109273410","Karen","This was amazing.  My favorite go to rice from now on.  Delicious.  I did only use 2 cups of basmati and 2-1/2 cups broth which was the only change I made.  I was a little worried and snuck a peak before the 15 minutes were up and tasted it to make sure the rice was cooked.  Oh my.  We had it with some shrimp.  I did cook it in the oven and it worked great.  Love this recipe.  Thank you.","1600906538","4"
"124214781","Leigh","I’d never had jollof rice before, and this was sooo good.  I followed the recipe, using jasmine rice.  I poached a couple of chicken breasts, shredded it, and mixed that in at the end for protein.  I can see it working great with spiced roasted chickpeas or marinated tofu.  This was fabulous!","1680669765","4"
"108068473","Dan","Doubling a recipe with rice is tricky. Twice the liquid with 2X the rice would probably be too soupy - maybe make double the obe ata but only use about 3 1/2 c for this recipe and save 1/2 c for some other purpose?  As for cook time, it might take a few minutes longer, but the rice will cook pretty much in the time suggested on the rice package no matter the quantity.","1594402228","3"
"108529433","Jo","The sauce is incredible. Best sauce I've ever made, seriously. Such a great complex flavor. I think the ginger makes it stand out as opposed to most pepper & tomato sauces. Don't use ginger powder in a pinch (because I know some of you want to) you'll regret it.","1596827340","3"
"116696852","Ruso","Very tasty. Great recipe. I used 2 cups jasmine rice to 2.5 cups broth as suggested by one of the commenters.","1643814403","3"
"117081436","Jutta","Watch video!!!","1645717713","3"
"120446643","naty","This was good and may or may not make it again - making the sauce takes time and I am not convinced it is worth all that time. I did cook it on my stove top on low instead of oven - I was using the oven to make the braised goat (not worth it!)","1663338060","3"
"111512659","Nicky","I don't often comment on recipes, but as I devour the leftovers from last night for lunch today I am inspired to shout from the rooftops how incredibly delicious this recipe is! The only difference I made was I used black forbidden rice (because thats what I had but I'd do it again and again) I was worried the rice-to-liquid ratio would be off but it wasn't. I used homemade vegetable stock and fresh turmeric which was definitely the move. I served it with the Beef Suya (Tofu Suya for me).","1612984540","2"
"118911698","Amanda","Watch the video on youtube for this recipe! It was really helpful!","1655848990","2"
"121844616","Aileen","Add 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  1tsp my non-spicy curry powder Cook on stove like Persian rice.  Adjust chili to taste.","1670256304","2"
"123343911","GC","Consider updating the instructions so that it is clear you don't cook the rice ahead of time. After watching the video I see you add dry rice but unfortunately I had already put the rice in the pressure cooker.","1677034946","2"
"124108676","Jessica N.","Do not make this on stovetop at medium low, it burnt so badly at the bottom! We were scrubbing for an hour. I would definitely recommend the oven instead.","1680205282","2"
