"101316813","Bellaverdi","Tasty, tasty. I did use Jessica’s suggestion to toast the orzo longer, to a light brown color. Because of that I delayed adding the garlic to avoid burning. Will cook this again.","1562372560","533"
"101337475","Andrew","Easy, very good.  IMPORTANT CHANGES:  use 1/4 t hot pepper flakes,  1/2 the salt, use 1 1/2 c liquid and taste the orzo after 9 minutes.","1562544116","312"
"101338180","Dave","I found 2 cups of water left my shrimp swimming.  Next time I’ll use 1 1/2.","1562552085","267"
"101295414","Jessica","This was simple and foolproof — the shrimp cooks perfectly with almost no attention. I toasted the orzo to a deep brown and used lots of parsley at the end, and ended up with something slightly nutty and herbal. Will cook again regularly.","1562253939","255"
"101315903","CJ - NH","12 minutes for orzo is too long. I used a small orchetta and some feta it was fabulous. Some sliced tomatoes on the side with red wine and crusty bread","1562368140","192"
"101459332","Mary","I found simply placing the marinated shrimp on top of the orzo to steam left a slight raw garlic taste, will try again, lightly sauteing (but not fully cooking) the marinated shrimp in the butter and olive oil first to avoid raw garlic taste, removing shrimp, proceeding with the orzo, then finishing by steaming shrimp on orzo at the end. Agree on reducing the amount of liquid to 1-1/2 cups stock. I made quick shrimp stock from the shells removed from shrimp. Nice, light, flavorful dish.","1563161018","170"
"101377722","Lois","Wonderful recipe.  The orzo actually took longer to cook (14+ minutes) to al dente.  Used store-bought seafood stock.   Was I supposed to boil the stock before adding it?  The recipe offers a choice of boiling water or stock--wasn't sure if ""boiling"" was modifying all the nouns or just water (oh, the dangers of a liberal arts education!).  This recipe will become one of my standard shrimp rotations.","1562757382","165"
"101338962","Q","Wow, surprisingly good! Doubled the garlic, and halved the zest, which I felt gave it a dessert-y feel (definitely personal preference). Tossed the toasted orzo with some oregano and thyme, and some fragrant peppercorns. I added a tiny amount of Pecorino Romano at the end as well as chives in lieu of parsley. Hugely successful in the household, will make again... perhaps with a bit of anchovy paste or pine nuts. Perfect for riffing!","1562565623","126"
"101334329","pdxer1","Love using orchetta.... little pockets collect juicy oil. I also use cherry multi color tomatoes when the orchetta is cooked and drop the shrimp and tomatoes at the same time and don’t cook more than 2minutes. Colorful and tasty","1562517641","115"
"101361178","M/R Cooper","Excellent flavor and nice presentation. Substituted Israeli pearl couscous for orzo and cooked a little longer. Used homemade clam broth (one cup), quick broth made from shrimp shells (second cup of liquid). Made a huge difference using flavorful seafood broth. Served in large bowls. Two of us ate entire four serving portion.","1562682439","97"
"101374296","Jaclyn","I made this recipe exactly as described and found there was way too much liquid resulting in me having to cook the orzo to death in order to not have a soup.  I would also suggest less red pepper flakes as this was incredibly spicy.","1562722551","73"
"101451257","Julia","I added a couple of tablespoons of tomato purée to the broth, and cut down the broth to 1.5 cups as suggested here. A large handful of halved cherry tomatoes in the pan with the orzo as it cooked.   More garlic than called for.  A delicious, deep flavour.  Handfuls of rocket and parsley on the finished dish (which was quite wet—like a runny risotto).  Green beans on the side.  It tasted of summer and the Mediterranean, and even my fussiest daughter liked it.  It was lovely, and I will make again","1563120483","61"
"104035271","MMM","Didn’t have orzo, made with linguine.  Used quick stock made from shrimp shells and tails.  Diners were delayed, so at halfway point of cooking pasta, had to take it off heat, cover it, and let it sit for 20 minutes in pan before resuming cooking and adding shrimp.  This resulted in pasta that had wonderfully absorbed the garlic and stock flavors but was just al dente.  Huge hit.  Will make it that way again.","1575799938","52"
"101565159","Bellaverdi","Have now prepared again. I tweeked a tiny bit. This time I used seafood broth for cooking liquid. Originally I , too, found the finished product too soupy. Therefore, before adding lemon and parsley and finishing s & p, I removed cover and increased the flame for about a minute to quickly reduce the liquid. I worried this would overlook the shrimp, but at all a problem. The flavors concentrated, and the final dish was savory and wonderful. A dish for 4 barely made it through supper (we are 2!)","1563583142","47"
"101404393","LCV in VT","Tofu cubed.  Marinate in a little oil, lemon, and garlic.  Then pan fry until browned on all sides.  Toss into the scampi after the rest has cooked.","1562860428","41"
"108481199","Bob Wright","Made this for the third time....third time is a charm.  Used top quality dried oriechette,  which I toasted for almost three minutes.  Used chicken stock, cooked pasta for 12 minutes then added the shrimp.  Cooked that 2 1/2 minutes, let it rest for a minute, and the chief critic (my bride of 33 years) absolutely raved.  This is a keeper.  10 Oz pasta, 12 large shrimp, and finished with a handful of chopped Italian parsley.  Awesome.","1596592048","35"
"102292618","Joanne Gipson","I add an entire bag of baby spinach and stir before adding the shrimp. Give the dish much-needed “green” without having to make a separate salad.","1567209755","33"
"101402886","Swede","Hi Maris, fresh is better for this recipe as you don’t cook them very long (maintains flavor). BUT, I live in a rural town and often don’t have access to fresh seafood so I use frozen and it’s still tasty. My kids don’t know the difference! I use shrimp stock to boost the flavor a bit.","1562857114","29"
"104021922","brutallyfrank","Relax. This is America. And the dish is called Shrimp Scampi, even though, in Italian, it's technically redundant.","1575679226","29"
"101318698","m","Cooked the orzo for a shorter amount of time (8 minutes) after putting in the broth","1562384132","24"
"106401869","Rebecca","After I peel the shrimp, I make a quick shrimp stock with the shells — med-low in a pan with 1 T neutral oil 3 min, add 2 c water and simmer for 7 min, press on shells while cooking and straining. I use that to cook the orzo in, following the recipe and topping off the dish with basil! Such an easy, delicious recipe.","1586554010","24"
"105217616","Sheri","I made this with 1 1/2 cups of liquid but otherwise exactly as written. I did add my shrimp shells into the broth and warmed it and strained it before adding it to the pot.  I used fresh caught shrimp.  I also added some shallot and spinach into the orzo to make it a one dish meal.  Next time I am adding some halved cherry tomatoes.  This is a keeper!","1581638999","23"
"111136924","Darcie Vandegrift","Hey Covid kids- had vodka and powdered garlic, so that’s what went in. And, shrimp was frozen. Cooked shrimp 10 minutes instead of 4 with bit of water and watched carefully. Everything worked out. Viva la improv.","1610844326","22"
"105718123","MollyT","Tried this when I was temporarily without a range so my usual boil-a-pot-of-cappelini to serve with the scampi was out of the question. Loved how the toasted orzo soaked up the sauce. I used the full amount of everything except just 10 ounces of shrimp and it made a nice entree for two. Oh, I did toss in a cup of frozen peas along with the shrimp so I could skip making a salad.","1583809706","16"
"104219175","Hiroko","2 cup water is too much. 1 1/2 cup.  Don’t need to cook 12 min. 7 min is good.","1576719060","15"
"112197306","Kim G","Lately I’ve been chopping my shrimp into smaller pieces in forky recipes such as this.. More intense flavor as sauces cling in the shredded edges, easier to manage a bite instead of a chew.. the platter stars a few prettily grilled intact specimens for special occasions.. using small pasta such as orzo is the perfect opportunity to save your pennies on smaller shrimp to be chopped.","1616960597","15"
"108853516","Ray","Excellent! I followed the recipe to a ""T"" with one exception: even though I was using a medium-sized, covered skillet I found that the shrimp was taking longer than expected to cook. Fortunately, that was an easy problem to solve: I just flipped the shrimp over and in another couple of minutes it was done to perfection. I hate overcooked shrimp, and I think that waiting for the tops to get done while the bottoms were already thoroughly cooked would have been a mistake.","1598562014","14"
"102660278","ssaitta","Used the big orange pot and added the stock at boiling","1569198356","13"
"103616645","anna","I loved this fish! The only difference I made was with stock. Since I LIVE the flavor of shrimp, I’m not about to waste a bit. All those shells and the head spell flavor. I boiled them with a little salt and pepper and used that liquid to cook the orzo - what fabulous flavor!","1573528790","13"
"112195393","Gerry","An excellent dish! I made the recipe as written and for the last 5  minutes added slender asparagus spears to steam along with the orzo and shrimp. A one pot wonder!  And the leftovers made a great salad base with cherry tomatoes, arugula and sorrel  for lunch next day.","1616948831","13"
"109878366","P. Charney","This is one of the best dishes I’ve made from NYT.  It’s easy, delicious and quick.  Simmered the shrimp shells in clam juice and used that as part of the liquid.","1604007757","12"
"104275782","Sue","I loved this. I didn't have orzo so I used fideos (broken spaghetti). Two cups of liquid seemed like a lot. I let the liquid cook down uncovered until it reached a sauce consistency. Then I added the shrimp and continued with the recipe.","1577037876","11"
"104362201","annladuca","Commenters say to use 1.5 c water or stock (instead of 2 c).","1577718342","11"
"104292837","Laura D","Excellent, and very easy. I didn’t have orzo on hand so used angel hair pasta with some modifications and we really enjoyed this.","1577143586","9"
"112257651","kara","This recipe is a big hit with my family and I make it pretty often – I add 1/2 a chopped onion with the garlic before adding the orzo.  After orzo has cooked for about 6 minutes or so, I add about 10 halved  cherry tomatoes and a few handfuls of baby spinach and put top on the pan until I am ready to add the shrimp - these additions really add flavor and texture to a delicious and easy dinner.","1617339516","9"
"111172678","Charley","This was so good. My only quibble is with the cooking time for the shrimp. Maybe I misunderstood the recipe, I thought it was saying to put the shrimp in a layer on top of the orzo and let them cook like that undisturbed for 2-4 minutes - having done that they were still pretty much raw. I stirred them into the orzo and cooked for a few minutes more and they cooked just fine.   Aside from that, a very easy and extremely delicious recipe. I will be adding this to my everyday repertoire.","1611095391","8"
"109331358","Nancy","I made this last night. It was sensational!!Used 18 large Australian prawns with tails on... 1.5 cups of liquid (combo of homemade chicken stock and water), and cooked the orzo 14 minutes before adding prawns. Am embarrassed to say it only served two of us! And we relished every bite! Thanks Ali!!!","1601249432","7"
"111805000","Mariann","My Husband and I cook this recipe alot! It is the best Shrimp Scampi . The Orzo is the perfect pasta for it.  Follow the recipe exactly. You will not be  disappointed!","1614621199","7"
"115626052","Ealondon","Fab recipe - my only critique is that it feeds more like 2/3 rather than 4!","1637699687","7"
"103661769","Joe B","This is the definitive shrimp scampi recipe in my house now. I got a nice toast on the orzo and the sauce was terrific. I will try cutting back on the red flakes and using more garlic just as a family preference.  I wonder what folks used for sides if different from the salad or steamed broccoli ?","1573742547","6"
"110991372","SirFreddy","Superb. Like others, I only used 1.5 cups of liquid and actually only about ¼ cup of wine. This will definitely be a regular dish as it is both easy and elegant and I usually have all the ingredients on hand.","1610142411","6"
"117639030","dora","Use 2lbs shrimp, 1.5 cup orzo, cut liquid to 2 and a little bit more cups broth. Add shrimp in at 9 mins bc it takes 5-7 mins or so to cook. Can also turn up the heat when adding shrimp.","1648776423","6"
"102673482","David","I also liked boiling the stock first. How big is the orange pot?","1569259353","5"
"107301299","Janet","Make your stock from the shrimp shells while you prep everything else. I like to use local Key West pink shrimp. Great recipe.","1590755767","5"
"103703160","jeanne","Delicious!  Only served 3 though OR maybe we were just hungry!","1573957549","3"
"112270646","Jo","Very good. Sprinkled feta on top before serving. Wondered if all of the bouillon would be absorbed, so kept 1/2 cup aside and didn’t use it. Made for rather small plates... would maybe cook 2 cups orzo next time and adjust bouillon.  Boiled water in kettle, added chicken powder stock to 2 cups of the boiled water.","1617405866","3"
"126357387","Cindy","Great quality to effort ratio for a weeknight meal. It really does need 2 cups of water though. I used only 1.5 per the comments and  it was a little too dry.","1689534957","3"
"126538307","susan","We took the advice to sauté the shrimp (we used spot prawns caught in the San Juan Islands, WA, which probably made a difference to the overall quality of the dish) for a minute prior to adding it at the end, so the garlic wasn’t raw.  Used a small spiral pasta instead of orzo and it worked out just fine.  We loved the extra sauce, it was so good we ate the whole thing in pasta bowls with spoons so none of it would go to waste.  This is one the best NYT recipes I have made, total home run.","1690254680","3"
"127001672","Em","yes works great with chicken! i've tried it with chicken breasts and also rotisserie. marinate it the same way and just stir it in since it will already be cooked","1692026818","3"
"127001770","Laurie","I make this all the time, one of our favorites!  I use 1 cup of clam juice and 1 cup of water for the liquid.  Comes out perfectly and is delicious.","1692026998","3"
"127008314","Sarahker","Amazing!  I made this recipe as directed (mostly) but doubled (and maybe a little extra garlic because who doesn't love garlic) and it was an absolute hit with my family, even the non-shrimp lovers.  I agree with previous posters about adding the garlic to the pan after toasting the orzo to avoid burning it, and to avoid the sogginess noted previously I popped the entire pan under the broiler for a minute to ensure that the shrimp were cooked through (mine were big fat ones).","1692039575","3"
"127008335","Dan","You suggest water or seafood stock.  For seafood stock, I suggest taking the shrimp shell peelings in this recipe, and boil them for 10 minutes, then drain and use that liquid as your stock.  It's more fragrant than it is taste enhancing, but it will help beckon folks to the table.","1692039618","3"
"109323536","Joe A.","It was surprising, but this one disappointed. I am a seasoned cook, and I think it's too easy to mess it up for most home cooks. When I made it there was just no there there. The browning of the pasta was a wasted step; I would just do a standard scampi recipe with a side of a rich pasta, instead of trying to combine the two into one.","1601214880","2"
"125423314","ct","Made as directed. Purchased whole shrimp and made a simple stock by cooking the heads and peels in a bit of olive oil and adding 2 cups of water.  Drained, Set aside then used the same pan for the dish and the stock for the cooking liquid. Excellent.    All the things I love: orzo, garlic, white wine, shrimp, lemon, butter, parsley, seriously what not to love? (Un)surprised by all the alterations in the comments.","1685492386","2"
"127002023","Judy","This is my husband's favorite meal!  I make it at least twice a month.  Enjoy as is!","1692027515","2"
"127004070","Rosane Balistreri","This is my all time favorite recipe.  Last week I added the kernels of an ear of fresh corn just before adding the shrimp. It was delicious. Adding a slightly sweet crunch to the dish.","1692031448","2"
"127012700","Lisa","Wonderful recipe!!  After peeling the shrimp I make a quick stock by boiling the shells with a bit of wine.  I use it instead of water.","1692049903","2"
"127883042","Lisa","This is delicious!  I removed the shrimp shells and tails and boiled that in 2 cups of water, which boiled the liquid down to 1 1/2 cups, which was plenty of stock.","1695256101","2"
"130987336","Katrina","What a luxurious weeknight meal! I used 2 c. of clam broth as the cooking liquid which deepened the shellfish flavor. When covering to cook the orzo, the heat must be set a bit higher than low - something like medium low so it's at a solid simmer which will help reduce the liquid and cook the orzo properly. We paired this with a pan-seared NY strip to make it the ultimate surf & turf, and would highly recommend doing so!","1707271625","2"
"131617997","Rachel","Very,very tasty! I plan to add this to our favorites! I agree that 2 cups of liquid was too much- I made a quick broth with the shrimp shells and garlic peels- and it was quite soupy. Next time I will decrease the liquid, or actually, I will add a bit more orzo.    Also, this did not make 4 portions. We got two smallish dinners plus 1 small lunch out of it.","1709600251","2"
"132119022","M.S.","Use shell on shrimp and make a seafood stock with those.","1711486037","2"
