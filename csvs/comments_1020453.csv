"109476297","R. Lax","Dear NY Times stylist, thanks for using my father's, Michael Lax's, teak handled, cast iron, skillet, the large one, by Copco.  Great skillets, but note, if you find one, due to the selection of the teak handle, you cannot put them into the oven.  My father was an industrial designer and designed/started Copco. The NYTimes ran his obituary in 1999.  He was a diehard New Yorker, born and raised in the west village on Morton Street and he went to Alfred University in the Industrial Ceramics dept.","1601906570","1228"
"102517275","Roland","Rather than honey, I substituted a splash of aged balsamic for sweetness as well as a touch of acidity.","1568524003","1073"
"102505625","summysumsum","This works great with the Trader Joe’s Cauliflower Gnocchi too.","1568434362","930"
"102659847","Heather","This was so good! We roasted the brussel sprouts to make them really crispy and then added them to the skillet along with a shallot and chopped garlic after crisping the gnocchi. Also topped it with a dollop of lemon zested garlic ricotta to finish. It was over the top delicious!","1569192457","457"
"102527171","Trepidatious Cook","I guess I'm the only whose brussel sprouts didn't cook in five minutes. I tried to follow this using the timing but ended up with hard brussel sprouts so I had to add liquid and let it simmer","1568590651","344"
"102683106","Jens","Fabulous! Life required that I roast the sprouts. I prepared as directed with lemon zest and red pepper flakes. My helper popped them in oven at 425. They cooked for 25 minutes to perfection. By time I got home, I had enough time to prepare gnocchi as directed before roasting was complete.. I had to make 2 batches for crowd I was feeding - first one used 6 T butter, second batch 4T. Four was plenty. Used balsamic instead of honey. Will make again and again !","1569285548","327"
"102503833","Thomas Burke","I have done this with pancetta rather than butter. It's fantastic, and it also would be almost as good with butter..","1568418950","291"
"105468233","Helen","Made this into a true 20 min meal by baking the Brussels sprouts in the oven (15 min at 450 degrees) while simultaneously cooking the gnocchi on the stove top. Mixed them together on stovetop at the very end as recipe says. Also, 6 tablespoons of butter seems crazy - I added 2 and my gnocchi were deliciously buttery and crispy! Quick and easy, would definitely make again.","1582772224","265"
"102530463","Julius Huckabee","My kids only dabbled in the brussels sprouts (understandable, and: more veggies for me!), but mainly stuck to the gnocchi. My wife - hates ""cabbage-y"" things - was astonished by how good it was. In my family, this counts as a success.  However: - This took much more than 20 minutes, more like 40. - I rounded up on the portions (I live in Europe and buy in grams). Nonetheless, there weren't any leftovers. Feeds four? Feeds two adults and two toddlers. Well.","1568628945","238"
"104912615","mark","If the gnocchi immediately sticking to the pan like glue freaks you out like it did me the first time, don’t worry. It will release once the butter melts (and with a nice golden brown crust). Do make sure they are completely broken up before they go into the pan though.","1580429766","201"
"102559044","Leslie","Followed exactly, except my sprouts were big so I quartered them. It took more than 2 min for the butter to brown but once it did, magic. Don’t skimp on the lemon zest and don’t be afraid of some bigger chunks of it after chopping — fried in the butter and honey they are a delightful contrast to the rest of the dish. Don’t overdo the Parmesan at the end, a light sprinkle does the job.","1568741050","176"
"102538070","DanG","Why decide between Pancetta and Butter when you can have both?!? One of the best things I’ve cooked at home in recent memory.","1568653216","161"
"102693134","KaraM","Cooked this last night and it was delicious. Next time I would double the Brussels sprouts and roast them instead of frying (my pan isn't big enough to properly fry that many sprouts!), try reducing the amount of butter by half (there was so much butter pooled at the bottom of my bowl when we finished it off!), then add the roasted sprouts into the pan to toss with the gnocchi at the very end. We didn't add the Parm because I was lazy and didn't bring it to the table, and didn't miss it one bit!","1569334685","131"
"102501488","Roland","I think some aged balsamic might be a good substitute for the honey.","1568409167","118"
"102711362","Delicious","We loved this one! I think the secret is a cast-iron skillet. This was the first recipe I’ve ever attempted in my cast-iron, and I am now a believer! I would probably throw in some bacon next time. And a handful of toasted pinenuts.","1569373810","102"
"104855710","s Blair","Wow. THIS DISH!  I’m shocked that it hasn’t totally gone viral. So simple and fast and scrumptious. Delicious just as is. We cut back the butter but I can’t remember why!  Want to make a weekday better? Cook this. Want happy kids? Cook this. Want guests to swoon. Cook this.","1580185891","90"
"102540241","Pudovkin","They cook through if you brown them on both sides and then add a few tablespoons of water to the pan to finish them off with a bit of steam.","1568659420","70"
"106822290","Lucy","Timed myself because it's quarantine and I'm bored. Took 23:14 seconds at a non-leisurely pace with no prep ahead of time. However my gnocchi were frozen so I feel like you could definitely do it in 20 minutes. I believe in you.","1588379261","63"
"102674578","helen","I cut my sprouts in 3 slices rather than halve them. This way they soften and brown much more easily. I used Trader Joe’s cauliflower gnocchi and it was an excellent dish.","1569261826","61"
"102726267","lisa","Nice recipe and tasted good but for my taste I think it needs more umami. Would fry some shallot along with the sprouts next time. That’s it though 😀","1569432805","57"
"102899524","Mara","Made a vegan version of this (used Earth Balance ""butter"" and Follow Your Heart parmesan) and it was delicious!","1570149501","54"
"102525760","Karen","Nope.  I fry unboiled shelf-stable gnocchi all the time and actually like them better that way.","1568573728","43"
"106845919","RMH","Have made this so many times - great dish. Double the Brussels, 4 T of butter rather than 6, and I roast the veg in the oven at 400 rather than on the stove top. Faster to prepare this way! Also use 1 T of aged balsamic rather than honey. Great ratio!","1588550690","43"
"102539293","Frltnwoman","This can also be made with Knepfle or Spaetzle if you’re in Alsace (or have access to Alsatian recipes) Directly into the oven, absolutely delicious !","1568656674","42"
"110591834","Jwl","First time I made this, I followed people’s notes, and we thought it was terrible. Because there were so many rave reviews, decided to make again following the recipe...absolutely fabulous. Do not deviate...she writes these recipes, and we don’t.","1607916135","41"
"102533708","cheerytomato","@Karen I can usually find shelf-stable gnocchi in the dry pasta section, often on the top or bottom shelf. I try to keep a package in my pantry at all times because it cooks so quickly.","1568641568","39"
"105098187","Annette","We absolutely love this dish. I add 1/2 lb crimini mushrooms (quartered) which I sauté after the Brussels sprouts until they render their water. the richness of the mushrooms really makes the dish. I have never cooked with shelf-stable gnocchi before, but now it is a pantry staple. My husband loves this enough to request it regularly...that's a HIT.","1581124282","39"
"109467509","Chezlise","Anyone else thinking that this cries out for bacon?","1601832570","36"
"102527154","Sierra","Made ricotta gnocchi and froze for an hour or so and used in place of potato gnocchi. Recipe still turned out great.","1568590308","32"
"102521746","SusanC","Cooked this yesterday and it was delicious. I used salted butter and it was fine. Very good with a light green salad with tomatoes and olive oil only.","1568557927","28"
"102522619","Heidi","Lemon and butter and honey with Brussels sprouts. One pan. What kind of miraclemeal is this?","1568560812","28"
"102544881","david","This was phenomenal. I used a non-stick pan and cooked the Brussels sprouts a bit longer to get them tender. Otherwise perfection.","1568676324","24"
"113965088","Sarah","I make this dish regularly when sprouts are in season, but this time tried it with broccoli. It turned out deliciously, and in fact the cooking times in the recipe seem more suited to broccoli than sprouts. (I usually steam my sprouts a bit so they aren’t rock hard) Since I have family members who prefer broccoli, I won’t hesitate to switch it up from now on. I follow the recipe exactly, with the exception of the steaming. Peppery goodness!","1628165357","24"
"116530110","Roger","I suggest the Cooks Ilustrated method for brussels sprouts - arrange sprouts cut side down in 12"" nonstick skillet (cold). Drizzle 5 Tablespoons olive oil over sprouts. Cover skillet, put on med-hi heat for 5 minutes. Uncover and cook 2-3 minutes longer. Fullproof and creates sprouts that are browned on the cut side and green on the outside.","1642986674","22"
"104971300","Julianne","I made this for the second time tonight and it's so easy I could practically make it one-handed. I love the texture the little gnocchi pellets (I use the shelf-stable ones) get after crisping up in the oil and bathing in the brown butter. My Brussels sprouts were enormous, so I cut them in half as directed during the searing step to maximize surface area, then chopped them into bite-sized pieces while the gnocchi cooked. I also like to add a small squeeze of lemon just before serving for acid.","1580713783","19"
"106655074","Jennifer","I roasted the Brussel sprouts with lemon zest, red pepper flakes and small red and yellow bell peppers for color, 425 for 25 minutes.  Did the gnocchi as directed with scant 4 TBSPs butter.  REALLY GOOD.  My vegetarian 17 year wants me to teach her how to make it, and my picky 14 year old liked it.  I zested the whole lemon but only added 1 TBSP of zest and you couldn't really taste it.  Next time I will add more","1587656032","18"
"102708850","MS","Takes ~double time to cook than posted. Otherwise good flavors!","1569366238","17"
"104907891","Melodie","Delicious! I was dubious about the success of frying gnocchi but it was perfectly cooked - soft and pillowy on the inside, and crisp on the outside. Followed the directions exactly, except I misread the instructions and added the juice of a lemon instead of the zest of a lemon to the brussel sprouts, which was still very tasty and helped them cook faster.","1580412432","16"
"111514972","Kat","Recipe is great, though I find I can get away with about half the butter (I love me some butter, but the dish feels a bit greasy with the full amount). Though frying the gnocchi dry is delicious, I also like steaming the gnocchi with a splash of water for 1-2min after tossing them into the skillet. This allows them to plump a bit (stretching the package a little farther!) and get fluffy in the centers before you crisp the exterior.","1612996135","16"
"102711424","Too Much Lemon","Don’t make the lemon zest too thick. Honestly, I wish I just used a cheese grater like I usually do. But other than that, not a bad recipe.","1569374085","15"
"105347544","Liz","Absolutely delightful. Browning the sprouts, gnocchi (I used Target shelf-stable mini gnocchi), and butter all took a little longer than stated, but I just watched the color and let them have the time they needed. Still very doable on a weeknight. It looks like a ton of butter when first added, but evaporation and absorption of the gnocchi took care of it. The finished dish is so good. Rich, crispy-chewy gnocchi and bright, browned sprouts. Added a teeny squeeze of lemon. Will make again!!","1582251214","15"
"111384647","Elizabeth McEvoy","Revelation - gnocchi can be crisped in the oven! Did this because I wanted to double recipe and crisp them all at same time. Put them and Brussels sprouts on baking sheet in oven, flipped the gnocchi and crisped on both sides.  Them finished recipe in pan.  Added the balsamic and it was delicious.","1612280847","15"
"109444939","Liz Hagiloizi","So love this recipe, it has become a family favorite even though I have made some adjustments. We now cook the brussels sprouts in 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 2 tablespoons of butter and season. Once they’re sufficiently brown on one side we remove them and place them on an aluminum lined pan in oven at 4:25. And we continue to cook the gnocchi in the pan with remaining ingredients to sufficiently crisps and combine the two. We find it uses less fat and taste just as delicious!","1601666736","14"
"105495459","judith","I made this with gluten-free gnocchi and it was delicious. It will definately be on my regular menu list.","1582872820","13"
"111535700","SRB","One of the most surprisingly delicious meals I've made. Important note, though: If you have leftovers, reheat them in some oil in a pan not in the microwave!","1613086924","12"
"109467310","Ted in AD","Also works well as a vegan recipe with olive oil instead of the butter and leave out the honey and parmesan.... I also pop thickly sliced carrot rounds in at the start, which adds color and a bit of sweetness.","1601830530","9"
"102792380","Anne Rabe","Just meh......Added two cloves of garlic with the honey and butter but it was still very bland.  I liked the Brussels sprouts on their own.  Maybe I am just not a big fan of gnocchi!","1569706371","8"
"110222086","sarah","Loved this!! Shifted the Brussels/gnocchi ratio to almost 50-50, if not more Brussels. Added plenty of garlic. Trader Joe’s frozen cauliflower gnocchi browned nicely in the skillet, without any water ( the package calls for water but this recipe does not - will never incorporate water again!). Thought the browned butter, honey, garlic and red pepper added up so well. Chopping aside this dish comes together fast.","1605752602","7"
"111591117","Laura C.","Just made this last night with frozen gnocchi. Didn't find it overly greasy at all and I went a little over the 18 ounces. Roasted the Brussels with EVOO, salt and pepper at 425 for 20 min. Removed from oven and topped with zested lemon. Browned the butter, then added some salt and the honey. Sauted my gnocchi with some EVOO for about 8-10 minutes, then tossed with all the components. Super delicious!!!! Will make again.","1613429565","7"
"116199469","Mary","This is absolutely delicious, simple and versatile and the best technique for cooking shelf stable gnocchi. I have made several times with the following changes: roast the vegetables in the oven (my fav combo is Brussel sprouts and butternut squash), cut the butter to 3 or 4 Tbs, and add toasted walnuts.  I put most of the lemon zest in the oven with the Brussels and toss rest with the butter and gnocchi.","1641325827","7"
"105343315","beth","LOVE THIS. A great veg meal, full of flavor. Used fresh (not home made) gnocchi and they turned out perfectly crisp outside and soft inside.  I squeezed a little lemon juice on before serving.","1582239876","6"
"111744580","Heather","Definitely dope this up with garlic, shallot, and the hit of balsamic vinegarette. I also used bacon as the base and added mushrooms and broccoli.","1614264901","6"
"111755087","Lulu","I have used Trader Joe's Cauliflower Gnocchi and just throw them in frozen.","1614301034","6"
"114606929","Liz","Vegans, today I learned that Miyokos vegan butter will brown while other plant-based butters will not. Eager to try this and will report back!","1632141490","6"
"116527834","Caitlin Q","Had to sub sprouts for broccoli this time but the result was still delicious! Balsamic instead of honey is a great swap too. I will definitely make this again soon.","1642971573","6"
"102659933","Michael","This was an absolute loser for my family. While trying to get the butter to brown, the gnocchi became leathery. The Brussels sprouts were still half raw. Admittedly, our sprouts were exceptionally large, but that's what came in the box (and the recipe didn't caution against large sprouts). Time to ""unsave.""","1569194515","5"
"123082310","SteveD","I had one eyebrow raised the first time I made this and was floored by how well it worked. Adding prosciutto or diced Black Forest ham would probably layer another notch of flavor, but I haven’t tried it because this recipe is off the hook good as written. Be sure your sprouts are just barely tender before moving on to the gnocchi; don’t overcook them. If the sprouts are very large, quarter them or they’ll turn bitter. If you’re a wine person, Gruner Veltliner pairs nicely.","1675907915","5"
"123616224","DorisR-L","The second time I made this, I upped the  honey to 1 TBSP, added 1 tsp or so red miso, and a half cup chopped walnuts (to up the protein). In response to my husband's dislike of the ""hard"" (overcooked?) gnocchi from the first time, I put them in simmering water for one minute before draining them well and panfrying them in butter. Perfect for us. Will serve adjusted recipe to guests.","1678203054","5"
"103097489","John","Very disappointing.  Really needs sauce.  Textures don't work.","1571093225","4"
"114513695","Chaukeau","Oven roasted the Brussel sprouts in oil with lemon peels. Leftover Portobello mushrooms marinated in garlic and balsamic vinegar added another layer of umami and texture.  Used TJ's cauliflower gnocchi.  The key is to go straight from frozen to hot pan - it does take 15-20 minutes on fairly high heat in a large frying pan for gnocchi to get crispy.  But a very satisfying and quick meal!","1631591962","4"
"120969578","Susan in Boulder","I started with about 4 oz of chopped bacon, crisped that up and then used the drippings to cook the brussels sprouts. From there I followed the recipe and used the bacon as a topping, before the parmesan cheese. It was such a hit with my family, our teenage boys demanded I double the recipe in the future. I serve it with apple slices for an easy weeknight meal.","1666018436","4"
"136035810","Elleji","Dear R. Lax: I am an industrial design junkie. Thanks for your lovely tribute to your Dad. Industrial designers are rarely given their due and his work is gorgeous!","1725835588","4"
"115286685","Kevin D","6T butter was too much. Next time I’ll use 3 or 4.","1635808786","3"
"115955257","Diane","I used frozen gnocchi from Trader Joe's, ended up with a pack with a gorgonzola sauce. Not bad, not bad at all. (As I stand eating up the leftover crispy bits before washing the pan.)","1639682962","3"
"116462860","Bernard Favre","Excellent recipe, I've cooked it three times. But, six tablespoons of butter? Serious? It works fine with one.","1642622105","3"
"121829072","Dennisa2","This was not a hit at our table and it was suggested that I not make it again. The gnocchi were beyond chewy; some were like rubber. Flavors were “meh”.","1670174348","3"
"123410615","annienell","I've made this a number of times using shelf-stable potato gnocchi, I cut the butter and subbed various brassicas.  All was good.  But my husband has been advised by his doctor to avoid potatoes so I tried Trader Joes frozen Cauliflower Gnocchi which were recommended by a number of commenters.  What a disappointment.  Instead of crispy exteriors with pillowy interiors they were just mushy. They tasted good, but...yuck.  Does anyone have any hints for making them better?","1677283251","3"
"132641975","marisa","Will not make again. The sprouts cook very uneven. The gnocchi don’t taste like very much. The flavors don’t blend very well.   I like the concept of the fried gnocchi but as far as execution this ain’t it","1713492506","3"
"133014944","Michael","Love it, we have made this 50+ times with the following changes: 1. Roast sprouts @ 425F. The listed method is not enough time to cook all the way thru. Add them after browning butter. Protip: Preheat your baking pan! They should sizzle on contact 2. Use 4-5 tbsp butter instead of 6 3. Add 2-3 cloves minced garlic 1 min from done 4. Sub honey for hot honey","1714961876","3"
"102563273","Zach","Did you defrost it first? Or add frozen?","1568749792","2"
"109793620","Idabelle","Way too buttery/oily for me. Next time will use a third or even a sixth of the amount of butter next time.","1603646398","2"
"111773053","Clare B","If you're looking to add a little protein to this dish, I highly recommend merging this recipe with the NYT Hot Honey Shrimp. The flavors complement perfectly to make an amazing one dish dinner!","1614387179","2"
"111809757","Andrew","Does not work with cauliflower gnocchi!","1614642225","2"
"121234177","SarahT","I love this recipe and have made it many times. This time around I couldn't find the shelf stable gnocchi and tried frozen cauliflower gnocchi. Ugh. Tasted fine but never crisped up and sort of looked like grubs. I'll hold out for potato next time. Added some fresh sage and thought that worked nicely.","1667263619","2"
"123011240","Bmoney","Nice recipe. Halve the butter though.","1675622211","2"
"131088993","sylvie","Half the butter","1707615812","2"
"133012879","julie","Very surprised by all the positive reviews. Both dry (notice lack of any sauce other than…butter) and extremely greasy (see previous note re: butter). If I try again might boil the gnocchi prior to frying to see if it adds some moisture, halve the butter, and double the ratio of Brussels to gnocchi.","1714944351","2"
"134276113","Nancy","Didn’t care for it at all.  Brussel sprouts didn’t cook through in the skillet even though I increased the time and eventually covered.  Gnocchi was chewy and unpleasant.  Way too much oil and butter, I used 2 Tablespoons of butter.  I really wanted to like it, but don’t think I can even eat the leftovers.","1719756775","2"
"134772914","Ruby Ishmael","Horribly unbalanced. You'd have to half the amount of butter to even think about turning this into something half decent. Pure salt and umami. Wretched.","1721333924","2"
"135648146","Fernanda","really did not enjoy this recipe with honey. i tried it again without it and squeezed a bit of lemon in just before serving. i liked that version much more.","1724372120","2"
"135948809","Katarina","We had this tonight. Delicious! Loved the crisped Brussels sprouts (took the advice in comments to roast separately in the oven, 15 min at 450F). Came together much faster to prep the gnocchi at the same time and the Brussel sprouts came out perfect. Searing and coating in brown butter might be our favorite way to cook gnocchi now - loved the crunchy outside and pillowy soft inside. Will try with other veggie combos.","1725490001","2"
"136084244","Ron","What blasphemy! Well made Gnocchi are pillows of ephemera; melt in you mouth delicacies. Why would you crisp them and turn them into chewy French fries?","1726008531","2"
