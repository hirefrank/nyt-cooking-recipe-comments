"102682493","Tim Huddleston","I do like olives but they aren't a favorite. Would a combination of olives and capers be OK? Or would the tang of the capers compete with the flavors of the chicken?","1569283249","437"
"102781078","hermsoven","We found our new chicken favorite. Perfect. Suggest not tampering with it. If you don’t like the ingredients, find another recipe before un-creating this one. In my oven, 25 minutes at 450°F leaves the chicken beautifully brown and juicy. A layer of aluminum foil will help keep the pan clean. Try spreading some of the marinade in the pan before adding the chicken. Move the chicken pieces around to coat the bottoms, then pour the rest of the topping over the skin sides.","1569616126","425"
"102687266","Frederick Tibbetts","Variations. For the vinegar, substitute the juice of one whole lemon, plus its zest. Instead of green olives alone, consider a mix of olives of different colors, including some kalamata, crushed and pitted. Bearing in mind that the parsley is going to wilt, not cook, add to it some fresh basil leaves, or some dried herbs, like thyme, tarragon, or marjoram. Any of these changes will play well with the chicken and turmeric.","1569311081","339"
"102694767","Far and Sure","Is there a reason to not mix the vinegar with the turmeric and olive oil? Won't pouring the vinegar over the chicken wash off the mix? Not asking for a friend.","1569338033","309"
"102776067","Debra Silkman","I'm not sure what happened to my note, so here goes again...don't use cast iron, it reacts with the acid and makes the dish taste tinny.  Use a sheet pan instead.","1569600101","292"
"102795689","Leslie","a note on turmeric --  there have been high levels of lead detected in tumeric, especially from India and Pakistan.  Packaging does not need to provide information with origin of powder, just place of packaging.  People have been advised to purchase new tumeric if you are using an older pack -I live in the UK so I do not know if this information has been distributed in the USA   also:  made this chicken.... loved it","1569754860","238"
"102828034","Glenda Corning","This was a hit... comes together quickly and is absolutely delicious! A few notes that might be helpful. Eight chicken thighs are about 3 pounds. An 8-oz jar of Castelvetrano olives yields 1 1/2 cups olives. Lastly, it is really important to grate the garlic so it is not overwhelming as it is never cooked. I love this main dish paired with farro and sauteéd spinach. It is elegant, simple and delicious!","1569902492","227"
"102757363","Sheryl Reich","The recipe was immediately appealing, but my husband of 24 years finally confessed that he ""didn't get much out of bone-in chicken"", so I tried it with boneless breasts and kept an eye out for overcooking.  It totally worked.  If anything, the tumeric measurement is a bit too modest.  Served it with mashed potatoes and parsnips.","1569537191","207"
"102777248","Laundy","Full disclosure:  I haven't cooked this, yet.  I will change Step 1 before even cooking it, though.  I don't mind an extra dish to clean, such as a deep bowl,  to toss ingredients before putting them into a rimmed baking sheet.  I learned that lesson (losing pieces to the floor) a long time ago.","1569602525","140"
"102709418","John Mark","Wonderful recipe! Cooking for olive haters? I love them but my husband hates them so I generally don't cook with them.  Instead I used chopped mushrooms (about 1.5 cups) and sundried tomatoes (around 1/4 cup) along with the garlic and parsley. It was delicious. (Might have been even better with olives but maybe next time.)  Also didn't have turmeric but used Indian five spice instead, and balsamic instead of white wine vinegar (it's what I had).  Lots of room for variation with this recipe.","1569367829","131"
"102693162","Doug Peddie","I would imagine this could be done in a cast iron pan vs a baking sheet?   Liking the addition of capers, lemon juice and crushed peppers.","1569334749","114"
"102718157","Russ","Easy to follow recipe.  Turned out very well.  Made a couple of modest modifications.  Added some lemon zest and juice of a lemon to the olive and parsley dressing.  Also added a few capers and a bit of smoked paprika.  Accompanied chicken with caponata and corn on the cob.  To be honest, polenta would have been ideal to sop up the dressing.  Had a Nero d'Avola with this dinner.","1569418422","113"
"102783192","SheilaW","To make this a complete one pan meal I added halved small potatoes to the pan and served it on top of several leaves of lettuce (Boston or bib). Chicken and potatoes cooked the same time and the sauce served as the dressing. I agree with the comments to add lemon and I will Also cut back on the olive oil next time. Turmeric doesn’t provide much more than color. Maybe a nice substitute will be paprika.","1569624203","94"
"102681494","M. Toft","I added crushed Maras pepper flakes to the chicken before it went into the oven, and lemon juice to the olive mixture to perk it up. Absolutely delicious!","1569279282","92"
"102783903","Claudia","Followed the recipe exactly but probably didn’t find the exact olives—did my best at the olive bar.  You know, I just celebrate when a recipe doesn’t start with sautéed onions...this all comes together in the oven where you don’t need to fiddle with anything for a good 30 minutes.","1569628308","66"
"102731303","PatC","FYI—the nutritional info—hence the calorie count—assumes all the sauce principally the olive oil and chicken fat is eaten. So just don’t eat all the sauce.","1569445490","62"
"102772460","Jeff Harrison","How can this be over 1100 calories per serving?  Is it really 1100 calories total for the entire 4 servings?  Can't eat if it has that many calories per serving.","1569592758","62"
"102893063","Geri","I made this recipe exactly as written and it was beyond amazing!!!  I made it a few nights ago and will be making it again tomorrow night ... a double batch this time for company!  So delicious!  I love capers but would not add them to this dish (as someone asked) The combination of flavors is perfect just the way it is written!","1570127660","56"
"102763582","L.G.","I'm not an olive fan, so I substituted chopped dried California apricots (not Turkish ones, they're too bland) for the olives, and otherwise followed the recipe.  Everyone here was happy with it.","1569551801","55"
"102775062","Barb S.","Cast iron reacts with acid. Your pan needs to be highly seasoned, or the acid in the vinegar will give the dish a metallic taste. However, using a large oven proof skillet or saute pan would make it easier to deglaze the pan on the stove after it's removed from the oven.","1569598029","54"
"102774294","Bobbu","Have been cooking this dish for more than 50 years!  Everything old is new!  Delicious.","1569596440","53"
"102752319","Pete Mack","Really excellent weekday recipe--it genuinely took 35 minutes from start to finish. I had to use calamata olives, so used only half as many as called for, and added some lemon juice to the sauce and paprika on the chicken.   Don't forget to trim the chicken!","1569525716","52"
"102930745","Conchita","To all the people who like to modify recipes, keep doing it. It’s human nature to experiment and improve on the ideas of others. I like seeing all the interesting variations to pop up in the commentary,","1570292537","48"
"102776769","Ellisa","Is that nutritional breakdown right? 1127 calories; 91 grams fat? Sounds way high for chicken.","1569601503","47"
"102674990","GBH","capers instead of olives, touch of anchovy paste, unpeeled garlic cloves in with chick, egg noodles or sourdough bread under chick","1569262802","39"
"102968834","Lizanne Pastore","Delish.  Pretty much as is. And when your dog knocks into you just as you are measuring out your turmeric, and you accidentally spill said turmeric (newly purchased, some sort of ""special"" turmeric I stumbled upon, actually rec'd by this very newspaper) all over your wooden kitchen island, and you sweep it up with your hand to salvage it, completely staining your counter a lovely shade of gold, use a little Bon Ami to clean.  Works like a charm.","1570495115","38"
"102930341","Lars","I made this exactly as the recipe says, with the addition of a squeeze of lemon and sprinkle of zest over the platter once it was completed. The bright acid at the end was key. I doubled the amounts to feed a crowd, used leg quarters that I separated and used two sheet pans in my oven. Served with buttered, parsley egg noodles and a spring mix salad with balsamic vinaigrette. Fed 6 adults and 6 kids and it was absolutely gobbled up. Spectacular, hands-off dish. Will be making this again!","1570290251","37"
"102823569","Jack","I was feeling crazy so I threw a can of chickpeas onto the baking sheet as well. Delicious!","1569885578","36"
"102783514","Willie","This dish has one of the best effort (low)-to-deliciousness (high) ratios of any chicken dish I’ve made. Totally great.","1569626137","35"
"104082103","PDM","Wow! That was amazing! I didn’t have any olives so used onions instead, and I didn’t have any turmeric so substituted paprika. I also didn’t have any chicken so used free range heritage pork. We aren’t big fans of vinegar so I went with soy sauce. It was so good! Definitely a keeper recipe!!","1576017501","31"
"102898985","Amber","The olive/parsley mixture creates a vinaigrette when added to the pan juices, but a way better vinaigrette because of the chicken fond.  We served it with warm, crusty sourdough and dipped the bread in the sauce on the platter until it was gone.  I cut up a whole chicken, removed the back, and cut the bone-in chicken breasts in half.  I put the back on the pan to get extra flavor for the sauce.  The special sauce for this recipe won’t happen with boneless, skinless chicken breasts.","1570148128","27"
"102903240","Jeff Winett","INSANELY delicious.  Admitting here, a weird fear....""fat"".  Normally when reading that a dish has a ""schmaltzy"" aspect, I run for the hills.  Something called to me and I needed to give this a shot.  The flavor bombs from the pan chicken juices/drippings were incredible, but instead of a adding lot of those juices onto my plate, I chose to let the olives speak, leaving most of the juices in the pan.  PLENTY flavor filled, from tossing the olives with the pan juices.   Alison Roman is a Goddess.","1570164986","26"
"104029412","apwinston","Somehow missed this recipe when first published. Will make it asap--BUT wanted to tell all the olive-haters that, if they haven't tried Castelvetrano olives, they should before they discard the recipe, or use something entirely different. Castelvetrano olives are, fresh,  delicate and very differently flavored from every other olive you may have eaten (and hated).","1575750398","24"
"107032596","Paolo","The original recipe was always 99% for me. The one thing that was always missing for me here was getting more out of the garlic/olive mixture being so raw. After spreading on the hot pan, pop the pan back in the oven for one minute. The olives soften, the garlic warms up and starts to golden, the parsley wilts just a bit, all sitting in the chicken fat bubbling. If you are nodding your head that this sounds like a great idea, it is, give it a try and get that last 1% of wonderful","1589406678","23"
"102777468","Adrienew","They use an API, Edamam, for the nutrition analysis. This misstep just means someone didn't put '4' in the /servings/ field on the back end of the site. For all we know, they could have an intern doing this and they didn't spot check. Your response is way more harsh than it needs to be.","1569603007","20"
"102792684","wendy","The Pullet Surprise is really quite funny.  Thanks!","1569709970","20"
"102931009","Daylight61","Divine! Took the basic idea and adapted it for a quick weeknight dinner using thin sliced chicken breast, dusted with flour, in the frying pan until golden and cooked. Removed from pan and then threw in all the elements of the sauce. Scraped up the brown bits, reduced and then poured a little over each thin sliced breast. A little rice to mop up this fab sauce et voilà! A really tasty, minimal fuss, weeknight dinner.","1570293937","20"
"103078002","Cynthia","You could put this sauce on an old shoe, and I could eat it. If you wanted a vegan version, this would work well on roasted potatoes or cauliflower.","1571007681","20"
"102728005","Susan","Chicken Marbella is baked, has prunes and brown sugar.","1569436740","17"
"102796565","Joan","Astonishing. I basted once during cooking and used lemon juice in place of water in the olive mixture. Insanely rich, easy and good. I had no idea it was possible to get this crispy tenderness without brining. Will make over and over.","1569764281","17"
"102750343","Flower","And the skin on the chicken!","1569522335","15"
"102785724","Elizabeth","This was quick, easy and amazing. I am a huge fan of all olive things, but not everyone in my family shares my enthusiasm. I thought this might be too briny, salty or vinegary- I was worried about pouring so much vinegar directly on the chicken. However it came together Beautifully. The skin was crisp and delicious, the olive and parsley topping just the right amount of salty and bright. Will definitely make it again.","1569641144","14"
"102935615","Linda Lenz","I have made this twice now and it's great!  The first time I used chicken breasts and thighs and a combination of Castlevetrano and ""Martini""olives (Spanish pimiento stuffed). Last night I used only two large plump breasts and a combination of Spanish olives and two generous heaping tablespoons of olive tapanade from Costco. My husband couldn't stop raving about how delicious it was. I cooked the chicken for 25 minutes and it was perfect...not at all dry. I didn't have any parsley.","1570315208","14"
"102791611","Kikafé","Didn’t have white wine vinegar and used White wine instead. Absolutely delicious recipe. Very easy to make.","1569699290","13"

"103098635","Morganhomer","Could use a few minutes of broiler time at the tail end to crisp it up.","1571098178","12"
"108839766","debra","This is one of my fave go-to recipes when it’s midweek and we want to feel like someone fussed over dinner...but not us!  Also, thank you fellow NYT Cooking readers—I’ve learned so much from you all. Your comments give me hope in humankind!","1598492875","12"
"102836774","Joe","1. Marinate chicken parts in buttermilk with hot paprika, garlic powder, and white pepper overnight.  2. Use 1/4 c. red wine vinegar, 1/4 c. sake, combined, and poured over chicken prior to baking.  3. Bake at 350, 60-90 min for more tender bird.","1569942014","11"
"102770212","Laurel","Click on the Nutrition icon. (i) But sit down first.","1569588040","10"
"104044827","Sam","After 4 tries I got a better result tonight with the following: instead of just pouring the vinegar over the chicken at the start, I poured just enough of the vinegar into the baking dish along with the salt, bit of oil, the turmeric and also some other spices to make a slurry at the bottom. I then just laid the seasoned chicken on top of this. Later, when making the parsley-garlic-oil mix, I added additional vinegar which also helped to further deglaze. The slurry helped concentrate the flavor.","1575862698","10"
"102930258","Paulis","I made it for Rosh Hashanah and everyone loved it! I didn’t tinker with spices or quantities and was able to get the pitted olives from Whole Foods. But I happen to have a very large pan that moves easily from stovetop to oven. So I dusted with a little flour, added seasonings and sautéed to give it a little crispness. Then baked. I finished off with a tiny hint of broiling and a squirt of lemon juice before serving. This is a wonderful, easy instant classic. Highly recommend!","1570289836","9"
"103504476","Mel M","This was absolutely delicious. I have to confess, as much as I believe it's best to just follow the recipe before trying any variations, that I didn't trust that the chicken would be tender after just 30 minutes at 450, so after 20 mins I lowered the oven to 375 and cooked for a further hour. It was super moist and fell off the bone, and the sauce was gorgeous. I will probably make this every week for the rest of my life (and maybe one of those weeks I'll try following the recipe as written)...","1572977611","9"
"104684410","Me","This was just OK. I followed the recipe exactly. Loved the sauce, but the chicken lacked flavor. Next time I will make this a braised dish, so the chicken will cook in the sauce. (Combine olive oil, turmeric, s&p, then rub it on and beneath the skin. Brown the chicken in olive oil, remove from pan, add garlic, deglaze with vinegar and chicken broth, add olives, return chicken to pan, cook til done, finish with parsley.)","1579286431","9"
"109772889","Randy","I have been making this for over 35 years. I first was introduced to it in NOLA at a small family place.  When I was taught this method, salted capers soaked in cold water overnight were used with the olives. Over the years, I’ve added fresh herbs-oregano & rosemary when I make it. They are chopped very fine and added to the olive mix before mixing with the pan juices.","1603496657","9"
"102785546","Roland","Rather than water in step 3, we used dry vermouth. I also think one needs to use a high-quality white-wine vinegar as opposed to a super-market brand, which was all I had available. A sprinkle of vinegar on each serving helped.","1569639511","8"
"102792946","JeanR","Really, really tasty. I used a very large, well-seasoned cast iron pan because my sheet pans are in disgraceful condition, and did not notice a metallic taste.","1569712588","8"
"103381883","Linda Whitehouse","Cook the chicken in a roasting pan with higher sides. While it is in the oven, heat water for pasta. Using two cups of rotelle, cook the pasta for half its time. Add an equal amount of sliced asparagus to the pasta water. When the pasta is al dente and the asparagus is crisp tender, lightly drain. Remove the chicken from its pan and keep warm. Pour the olive mixture into this oven pan to deglaze the bottom adding water if necessary. Toss in the pasta. Then plate with the chicken on top. Elegant!","1572391822","8"
"104626689","johnny noon","Made this the other night and it was fabulous. Added about 20 whole garlic cloves to the recipe to roast and a cup of chicken stock so we would have more sauce. Yummy.","1579028429","8"
"109468822","magnamosa","love this easy recipe.  i double the garlic and put it all in a ziplock overnight (except the parsley) and then all goes right on the pan.  so easy and delish","1601849352","8"
"102806601","Richard Anderson","Did you also cut your baking sheet size in half? If not, the amount of material on the sheet might not yield the proper result but instead exactly what you describe: a burnt coating. I'm using a European size oven with reduced quantities *plus* I will need to use something other than a baking sheet — partly because of the size but also because the ""baking sheet"" I have available is not flat. I am considering a large cast iron pan instead and keeping an eye on the liquid content as it cooks.","1569849324","7"
"102910177","Kirsten J.","For the love of olives! This was jammin'! Super easy and used with Castelvetrano, kalamata, and capers because I had them all. Side with wild rice and broccoli. Even my picky eater ate it all.","1570200681","7"
"102929995","jf","Cooked exactly as written. Would not change a thing. It was both delicious and pretty enough for a party.","1570288779","7"
"102930278","rebecca","Way too much olive oil. It is better with half as much oil and lemon juice instead of vinegar","1570289973","7"
"102931024","JSM 808","Fantastic. Contrary to my concerns, the vinegar mellowed during the roasting and it’s slight remnant astringency paired well with the herbal bite of fresh turmeric (I’m lucky to be able source it fresh and juice it). Had some artichoke hearts an capers to use and tossed them in with a clove of micrplaned garlic as well... oh so good. This is a keeper.","1570294042","7"
"102947067","LB","Honestly we found this a bit overrated. Though the method was intriguing the vinegar didn’t add much and the skin got a bit soggy. Probably wouldn’t repeat.","1570408257","6"
"103017003","Randy","It was fine. Tasty, even. But not the revelation it's made out to be. It reminds me of the ""Mississippi Roast"" hype from a few years ago.  I followed the recipe exactly. I suggest cutting large breasts in half so that they'll be done the same time as the dark meat.","1570670542","6"
"103046082","Jan Johnson","It was wonderful. I am guessing it might even be better if you make it, let it sit with the olive sauce covering the chicken and keep it warm for 15-20 minutes before serving. The flavors were terrific. VERY EASY","1570806228","6"
"103129897","M","Flavour is excellent but the dish is pretty oily. Next time I plan to use only 2 tablespoons of oil in the olive mixture instead of 4.","1571251937","6"
"102932803","Jim Saugatuck","We loved it without making any changes.  Now, maybe we'll experiment.","1570303703","5"
"103098735","Nina","I made two small changes; I marinated the chicken for about 30 minutes in the vinegar/turmeric/oil mixture, and I used champagne vinegar because it's what I had. I used wings and thighs and this recipe was INCREDIBLE. I also marinated tiny potatoes with the chicken and roasted them in the turmeric sauce (cooking for one, I had plenty), and sauteed green beans with shallots as a side. This is getting added to my weekly rotation!","1571098588","5"
"103907859","Bynska","I made this for guests.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Everyone (including my VERY picky brother) raved about it.  I will make this meal again and again, it was fabulous.","1575154318","5"
"115275093","JanisV","Made this for the second time tonight - so good! The only step I added was to pop the chicken back in the hot oven (on a clean sheet pan, leaving the sauce on the other) to crisp it up. It had kinda steamed instead of roasted, probably due to my schmaltz-loving decision not to trim any fat from the thighs. There ended up being A LOT of liquid, so crisping didn’t happen. Worked a treat to toss it back in for 10 minutes.","1635727938","5"
"102842410","hdoran","I think a cast iron fry pan would be better.","1569952773","4"
"102979770","Kelly","Love Alison and was excited to try this ""famous"" recipe, but was honestly a bit disappointed. Followed recipe exactly, and didn't skimp on the salt. The chicken was quite bland; the vinegar/turmeric didn't add any flavor. The olive mixture is simple and good if your olives are good, but it didn't really emulsify with the rendered fat/leftover olive oil, and the sauce ended up being overly oily and raw tasting. Not sure where I went wrong?","1570548599","4"
"103454908","Patricia B","We absolutely loved this recipe. I did find chopping the olives a little tedious as I made a double-batch for a crowd. It was a knockout!  I have been searching for a jar of olives already crushed and pitted, but haven’t had any luck.  The green Castlevetro olives were perfect in this recipie as they are mild enough, even for non-olive-lovers.","1572711161","4"
"103786817","Andrew","I have cooke this 3 times and it has been a big hit . I modified it a bit in that I cook the chicken in a large cast iron skillet transfer the chicken once cooked to a heated platter and finish the sauce on the stovetop. I also add a light dusting of ground cardamon to the chicken before roasting .","1574380885","4"
"103903841","Larry Blow","This is a family favorite.  Delicious, easy to make, and a new flavor combination.  I think the secret is that particular type of green olive.","1575123881","4"
"104087054","Julianne","Absolutely delicious. I made this tonight and was blown away. I added some paprika to the chicken. I didn't have enough white wine vinegar so I filled it out with rice vinegar. I also didn't have parsley so I used chives and a bit of cilantro. It was outstandingly good.","1576040739","4"
"104106901","Paul in MN","This turned out really well. Stuck to the recipe, except doubled the turmeric per another comment. Cut up whole chicken but went boneless w/ the breast. When you mix the olives, garlic, and parsley into the pan juices, everything becomes very fragrant, and quite beautiful on the platter. With oven @ 450 a pan of roast veggies was a good match.   Never used Castelvetrano olives before. $6 at grocery store, but Costco has a large jar for only $8.","1576119981","4"
"104140572","kathy","Buy pitted olives to simplify things","1576281191","4"
"104425336","Christine Sherry","I made this twice and would say: add more turmeric than the recipe calls for to get the lovely orange/brown color and also, add marinated artichokes when you cook the chicken for additional flavor. A lot of artichokes.  It's tasty but it was not stupendous when I followed the directions exactly. Artichokes added flavor.","1578077551","4"
"104433477","Dale","OMG, this was fabulous. We loved it. I’m a castelvetrano lover so this was right up my alley. If you don’t like the ingredients, don’t make this recipe. It is what it is and it’s delicious and not in need of any changes. 25 mins at 450° with turmeric, salt, pepper and vinegar works. Parsley, garlic, water and olive oil  with crushed castelvetrano olives works. Add them together and you’ve got chicken perfection. Nothing else needs be said.","1578104977","4"
"104655289","Judy","Similar to Silver Palate's  Chicken Marbella but not as good.","1579182774","4"

"106928377","Denise Shelton","I would caution those who think they won't like some of the ingredients. Don't mess with it until you've tried it as written once. I thought I hated green olives and tumeric. Maybe I do, but I LOVE them in this.","1588887208","4"

"114642945","Seth B","This is phenomenal for any chicken-vinegar-olive lovers Some ADDED SUGGESTIONS to make it extra special! - after the chicken is roasted, use the fatty pan drippings to make the sauce to top chicken with  - sauté the garlic and 1-2 anchovies in drippings for 1 minute; add in olives to warm - cut the heat and finish with a nub of butter and a splash of white balsamic vinegar  - cover the chicken in this goodness and top with fresh parsley, chives, and roasted chopped pistachios   Thank me later","1632273036","4"
"116866615","Andrew","SUPERB!  For crispier chicken, season the chicken with salt, pepper, and 1 tsp of baking powder and let sit for 20 minutes. To avoid the turmeric “washing off” when pouring the vinegar, whisk the turmeric and 2 tbsp of olive oil as you would a salad dressing in a medium bowl.  Drop the chicken into the bowl and coat each piece thoroughly, letting sit for about 30 minutes.  Also, put your sheet pan over a burner on low heat when bringing the olive sauce together.  Longer prep time, but worth it!","1644587400","4"
"102802017","Charles B.","Lots to like here. The Castelvetrano olives are delicious and perfectly suited for the other delicate flavors (save the garlic). I made the dish exactly as written, and although I enjoyed it, I felt the garlic was overpowering, mostly because for all in tense and purposes, if was raw. The next day, I sauted half a sliced onion in butter until softened, a cup of chicken broth, 1/2 lemon juice w/zest and red pepper flakes and simmered briefly. The modified dish was delicious over rice. A keeper!","1569810297","3"

"102946979","Klaus","I used a whole spatchcocked chicken which worked out perfectly. I also doubled the turmeric. I also didn't quite have enough of jus so I poured some dry white wine in the pan.","1570407374","3"
"102963884","Nelle Engoron","Since you tasted the pan juices first, you must have added the vinegar after cooking. As recipe indicates, you add it before cooking. It doesn't end up tasting vinegary at all if you do it that way. Also be sure to use white wine vinegar, not some other kind.","1570478501","3"

"103711679","Juliet","This is lick-your-plate good! My notes: 1. Seasoned chicken with salt, pepper, turmeric and olive oil about 7 hours before cooking. Next time would do a day ahead if possible. 2. baked for 30 minutes, last five on convection bake to crisp up. I used a mix of chicken thighs and breasts (that I cut in half). Served with mashed potatoes, would be great with rice or bread, anything to soak up the delicious sauce.","1574017192","3"
"104483963","Wendy S","This is a great, easy and delicious recipe.  One small variant which I stumbled on due to lack of enough parsley: substitute 1/2 cup cilantro for 1/2 cup of the parsley in step 3-it adds even more complexity and deliciousness.  This is now in our regular rotation and greeted with happiness every time!","1578399029","3"
"104522993","MaryG","This is one of my all-time favorite recipes. Easy and delicious. Serve it with a baguette to soak up all of that amazing sauce!

"105950023","citymom","Cooked as directed and it was great,  I spli t recipe and this cooked in a skillet in oven so sauce would not spread too thin. So easy and so good.  Just don’t grab pan handle when sitting it on stove when adding olives...ouch!!  Used large breasts which I split.  Very moist.","1584747505","3"

"115871691","Steph","I tried this,  knowing my husband loves olives and vinegar.  He declared,  ""I Love this dish!"". I seasoned the chicken with turmeric,  s and p and olive oil in the morning,  and put on the sheet pan to roast with the vinegar after work.  Hint: use gloves to marinate and move the turmeric chicken or you'll be golden for days.  I put the olives, garlic, cilantro (subbed for parsley) and water in the food processor,  omitting the additional olive oil as there was plenty of schmaltz. Will make again","1639183630","3"

"102970672","Christine Cote-Wissmann","Something seems to have gone wrong. Was bland, not tangy. I seem to have followed the recipe, though most of the vinegar was around not on the chicken. Should I have mixed an acid with the olive mixture?  The olives were purchased at a local organic type market.  Purchased pre-pitted.  Dull flavor. Any thoughts?  Capers?  Olives packed in vinegar?","1570502189","2"

Sheet pan smoked horribly halfway through cooking so I added a half-cup of water to the pan. It didn't seem to change the recipe much. Served with white rice and a simple salad. Very delicious.  Will make again.","1570766159","2"

"104053803","marcolius","Not sure why they recommend a sheet pan.  I used a regular cake pan; it was easier to stir in the olive mixture without sloshing it over the edges.","1575916022","2"
"104112032","Tim Carroll","I thought this was great. Only addition was to add some chopped up preserved lemon to the Castelvetrano olives for some added brightness. Only downside is that turmeric stains my quartz countertops! Have to be super tidy (which I am not). :) But definitely will make again.","1576160204","2"

"108710026","karen j","Made this last night.  Due to 106 weather at 7pm, I cooked in a cast iron on the grill.  Skin crisped nicely, but produced less chicken drippings. (I also had bone in skin on breasts only). My daughter doesn't like olives, so added some capers to the olive mixture.  Only other change was zest and juice of one lemon with the pan sauce.  Really easy and good.  I will try sheet pan next time.","1597855122","2"
"109703602","cmc","Interesting. I've been making this just for myself with one chicken thigh, so I've been eyeballing the topping ingredients. I've had to use mostly Kalamata olives since I haven't been able to find the Castelvetrano in the store where I live, but I've cut the amount to allow for the stronger taste. I've loved it.  But tonight I made it for three, and found that it wasn't as bright as it was for one, probably because of the extra schmaltz. I see now why some people recommended adding some lemon.","1603162516","2"

"119076680","mill","This is an excellent recipe - I add more turmeric, garlic powder and vinegar. To the olive mix I add lemon juice and zest and once the chicken is browned in the oven and add the olive mix, I pop a couple of knobs of butter in and really let it simmer and emulsify into a gravy. Takes about 20 mins longer but worth the extra wait,  I serve with buttered rice and steamed green beans. Even my 3 year old loves it. Winner winner chicken dinner.","1656635942","2"
