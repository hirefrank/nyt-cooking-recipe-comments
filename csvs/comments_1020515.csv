"102943919","Ak veg","Can this be prepared in advance, up to step 4, and then reheat and broil the next day?","1570376178","1561"
"103585071","Dan Findlay","For those with Pyrex under the broiler questions some clarification is in order. There are PYREX and Pyrex glass dishes and they are not the same. PYREX is the original, better borosilicate glass that is no longer sold in the U.S. Pyrex is the newer, cheaper soda-lime glass sold in America. PYREX should be able to withstand a few minutes under the broiler. Pyrex is best handled with great care as it has a lower thermal shock resistance.","1573331358","1277"
"103077119","Isa","All I have to say is this recipe is dirrrrrty. I inhaled it. I add a little ground mustard and cayenne pepper to mine, like my Nana does. You won't find a richer, crispier, creamier, cheesier mac & cheese recipe.","1570998917","958"
"104366444","David","Finally! A macaroni and cheese recipe I would call ""black.""  Food represents culture. Although you did not give it a cultural origin, most ""mac & cheese"" recipes begin with a roux. That would be white people's versions. Blacks don't even say ""mac & cheese""; but ""macaroni and cheese,"" perhaps because it's served formally. The current recipe is how my mother and aunts made the dish. I have since toyed with it by substituting pureed cottage cheese for milk and adding dry mustard and cayenne. Bravo!","1577733442","687"
"103075333","Becky","Made this last night, and my family and I agreed best mac & cheese we've ever had.  I read the notes from some who advised to let the hot pasta cool a bit before adding it to the egg/milk mixture so you don't end up with scrambled eggs, that was very helpful.  I used the warm melted butter to temper the milk/egg mixture, and then I was able to add the warm pasta in with no problem.  Keep a very close eye on the broiler and do let it sit up for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.","1570982951","571"
"107222988","Susan","I’ve made this recipe four or five times now and each time it’s been creamy, rich and delicious—just like macaroni and cheese should be. Couple of things—make sure your 350 degree oven is on for at least 20 minutes before putting dish in to bake; make sure your pasta has been rinsed in cold water before adding it to cold milk/egg/cheese, salt and pepper mixture (Mixed well), and add melted butter last, mixing butter in quickly and vigorously. Make this dish! It’s five stars!","1590434868","398"
"104314759","michaelinportland","This recipe is missing two crucial words: room temperature.  I got a late start and pulled the milk and eggs straight from the fridge - it’s been quite an ordeal to finish the recipe.  The melted butter immediately resolidified when added to the mixture (obvi, I know, unless you’re moving fast).  Then after 40 min in the oven, still watery and only now starting to get warm.  I’m sure it will still taste amazing, but just having the words “room temperature” by the milk & eggs would’ve saved me.","1577316517","368"
"107265388","Kat","I wonder if folks who are complaining this dish is runny---who are legion---I wonder if they really shook the water out of the macaroni when they were draining the pasta.  Those little tubes can hold a boatload of water.","1590616054","291"
"103043606","Anna","I'd add a mix of panko, butter and garlic powder on top, give it a nice crunchy breading","1570799355","224"
"104969980","paul","Made this for a super bowl crowd and it was a hit, but I could see some of the problems others describe. I needed to take the first baking to 30 minutes to get the first complement of cheese melting and the liquid simmering. I added the second helping of cheese, and then went with a 450 convection setting instead of broiling, which browned the top in a controlled way.  The recipe may be very sensitive to the pan you pick, how wet your rinsed noodles are, your oven’s temp ... use judgement.","1580698255","214"
"102947270","SeasideOma","Now I know where my mom learned how to make Mac n Cheese! A new Army bride (from Germany), her first posting was Atlanta, Georgia. Only thing different is she always added half a finely chopped onion and topped with toasted bread crumbs and butter. Yum! And we always ate it with ketchup!","1570409725","196"
"103582752","Bonny","I don’t understand the obsession with putting bacon in every single dish!","1573317495","170"
"103042117","Will","Perhaps two pounds of cheese?","1570794137","132"
"103604118","Mike Hawley","my family has always made what we called ""macaroni pie,"" which is the cooked macaroni layered and topped with generous amounts of cheddar cheese.  Then, a mixture of eggs and milk were poured over the casserole.  Bake at 350F until done.  Most excellent.","1573484240","115"
"115584980","marilyn","My summary of some suggestions...did them all and worked out great.  1. Let pasta cool before adding eggs, so don't cook eggs. Temper. All ingredients at room temp. 2. Add dry mustard? Yes  Add cayenne?  yes 3. Can use less butter. Add butter last. 4. Might need to cook 20 minutes longer on first bake. 5. Preheat 350 at least 20 minutes. 6. Rinse pasta in cold water.   7. Drain pasta very well, so no water in tubes. Otherwise drippy mac/cheese","1637419933","108"
"102946064","Daniel","Your pasta was still warm when u added the eggs which is why they seemed scrambled","1570395210","101"
"103228413","Nora Simmons","Served with collard greens and corn bread to raves!","1571716134","84"
"106470850","Josh","Just made this - delicious! Just like my mom makes.  For those commenting about greasiness, it's supposed to be greasy, this is not healthy by any means. However, it absolutely does not need an entire stick of melted butter in the egg/milk mixture - I'd say half a stick at most. That definitely contributes to its outcome.  I will be making this again, thanks for sharing!","1586892892","78"
"103194139","Isa","Excluding the roux, basically. Mac and cheese in other parts of the country is creamy and saucy. In the South it's more of a baked-together kind of casserole, with no ""cheese sauce"" and a golden brown lid of cheese.","1571533426","77"
"107409418","Nick","The disaster is you adding boiled broccoli to mac and cheese. Serve it on the side like a human being with a brain.","1591203480","77"
"104028795","PBW","If done right, this dish is really yummy. Perhaps you, (and the others complaining that the dish was runny), didn't cook it long enough.  Most commenters who found this to be a delicious dish cooked it for about 20 minutes longer (40-45 minutes) on the first bake than the recipe specifies. Not all ovens bake evenly.","1575746492","74"
"106225975","Kami","This was really excellent.  Followed instructions for mixing, assembly, and cooking, and adjusted the ingredients to fit into an 8"" x 8"" Pyrex dish.  Thought I'd share the adjustments: 8 oz. macaroni, 1 C milk and 1 egg (both room-ish temp), 1/4 C unsalted butter, 8 oz. grated extra-sharp cheddar, 1 C grated Colby Jack.  Instead of rinsing the pasta I let it cool while prepping other ingredients.","1585861369","72"
"102938290","Lori B","My family from Tennessee, I did not know Mac and cheese could be creamy!  A good, solid dish.  Mom would sometimes put bacon or green chile in it (you know, New Mexico).","1570329263","71"
"102945939","Jo","About 50 years ago, I lived in North Central Florida. It was my pleasure to be acquainted with another young woman, native to the area. She made macaroni and cheese by the same method using local wheel cheese and if lucky, a bit of Velveeta.   So yummy! Such a treat for Sunday dinner. I will make it tonight, but just for 2!","1570392875","71"
"103404571","Pam","Greasy, gross, and disgusting.","1572484784","64"
"103950346","Leslie","I was skeptical, but this was great. I used a deep 9x9 pan and it took 40 min for the whole thing to get bubbly during the first bake. I can't get colby jack where I live so I used  a melty asiago instead, and I added pinches of mustard powder, cayenne, and nutmeg to the milk mixture, and the result was great. I have tried almost all of the mac and cheeses by the NYT and I am surprised to say that this might be my new favorite.","1575404151","52"
"103074974","LayLay","I have been making macaroni and cheese since I was 17. This recipe is very similar to my own but I add a block of Velveeta in my macaroni and cheese for added creaminess.I also use sour cream and 2% milk, and I have never had a complaint. It's always the first thing to go on any occasion that I make it. But I really like the idea of having the cheese in the middle. I'm going to try it the next time I make it.","1570981189","51"
"102990265","EricJM","Robert Ameeti - As there is no salt in the recipe, though many make pasta with salted water, I think she claiming the saltiness from all the cheese was the issue.  Which is possible.  6 cups of the shredded cheese listed will add up to over 4000 mg of sodium average.","1570576969","49"
"105011532","Peter","Sure made the Crew at the Firehouse happy! Just as written. Always follow the recipe the first time.","1580861427","47"
"103583297","Nancy McAfee","This is just not very good.  The ""sauce""--eggs, milk and cheese is like a custard and doesn't really coat the pasta.  Its on the mushy side.  Dont make it!","1573319917","43"
"103651272","Elyse","What a lovely remembrance and what a terrible mac and cheese!  too much cheese, too much butter! We ate a bit and I move the whole thing to smaller  casserole. It need some roux - that would make it silky - it isn't now.","1573682652","43"
"109892291","Ceela","This is the first time I've seen a recipe that approximates our family Macaroni and Cheese. Instead of mixing the pasta, egg/milk mixture, and cheese, we layer macaroni, cheese, butter, salt, and pepper in a 1 1/2 quart buttered casserole. Two or three layers. Then pour the egg/milk mixture over. Servings come out in moist, gooey chunks. This was my favorite growing up. When I was an adult my mom would make it when I visited. Food memories. The best.","1604080517","42"
"109898230","Amrie","I used a horseradish cheddar for 1/3 of the cheese, and I have no regrets.","1604104783","42"
"108714565","Wendy","I'm not sure why I've never seen a mac and cheese recipe like this before, but I am pretty sure this is what I'd pick for my last supper.  It's unbelievable.  If you're on the fence about making this -- jump in, you won't regret it.  You'll gain 5 pounds, but you won't regret it.","1597869804","40"
"105647399","RAMJ","Such a simple recipe, as if a blank slate ready for personal touches such as; a tsp of dry mustard, a tbsp of minced jalapeno, serrano or fresno pepper, a tbsp of minced pimento, a tbsp of minced sweet red pepper, 1/4 tsp onion powder, 1/8 tsp cayenne, a little minced onion or shallot, a sprinkle of paprika of choice, sweet smoked or hot, a sprinkle of adobo spice blend, cracked black pepper, panko bread crumb and butter crumble on top.  Making myself hungry. Thanks for posting this.","1583502391","38"
"107396733","cabutongue","This.   This is the right way to make THICK decadent mac and cheese.  None of the saucepan sautéed flipped quick restaurant style that pervades so much in the USA from those who don’t know the joy of the simple egg thickened cheese batter that turns out perfectly from your grandmother’s love, experience and memories from 30-50  years ago. Sigh.  Add red pepper flakes.  I’m serious.","1591147178","35"
"103157844","bar","Made as given, it was almost too cheesy.  I’d cut butter in 1/2, cut back on cheese.  Does not need salt the cheese has plenty","1571349661","34"
"105057656","Will","Be careful when adding the eggs, if you don't let the boiled pasta cool first then you will end up scrambling them.  I ran the noddles under cold water while straining them before adding the egg, this seemed to work fine.","1581006918","33"
"103895952","Bri G","A delicious Mac and cheese I made for the whole family at thanksgiving! The first time I made it, my husband said he liked it better reheated, so this time I made it the day before and stopped before broiling. I reheated it the next day until it was warm again and then did the last broiling step and it tasted delicious!","1575037909","30"
"109666974","Ed H","I hope that everyone takes careful note of Dan Findlay's caution about PYREX vs, U.S. Pyrex. A close friend had one of the newer tempered soda-lime ""Pyrex"" dishes explode in the oven, with little provocation (the contents were not frozen, and he wasn't broiling). I'm told that traditional borosilicate PYREX can still be obtained from cooking supply sources in France. Meanwhile, use caution.","1602888658","28"
"105643388","Janet H.","Needing a good recipie for a future gathering, made the recipe exactly.  Like some reports, sauce was too soupy.  Wading through useless editorial comments in search of ideas from those who actually made the dish, I tried the suggestion of pureed cottage cheese instead of milk - brilliant, thank you!  Also tried the other suggestion (don´t hate!) of velveeta in place of half the milk and all the eggs - to help bind the sauce - and I hate to say it but this was also really good.  :-).","1583477330","25"
"120088494","Jen M","Please do not buy pre-shredded cheese and use it in this recipe (or in any recipe for that matter).  It contains an anti-closing ingredient that prevents the cheese from melting properly. Always buy a solid block of cheese and shred it by hand. I wish more recipes would clarify this for those who don’t cook often enough to know this.","1661536013","25"
"107938968","Tawanna","I am a native southerner and have made Southern Macaroni and Cheese all my life (will be 60 next year). Mine is very similar to this recipe except I use 1/2 stick butter and add 8 oz. sour cream. I don’t rinse my pasta unless making a salad with it. I bring the milk, egg, butter, and sour cream to almost boiling in microwave. This will make the roux your looking for without over exertion. You can heat on top of stove also but be sure to use non-stick pot and don’t over boil mixture. Perfection!","1593791676","23"
"106964711","MJ","Followed the recipe exactly.  It came out right.  It is greasy for mac and cheese, but not overwhelming.  I think key is to cook the elbow macaroni for only 4 minutes.  It needs to be undercooked and then rinsed in cold water to stop the cooking so when it is mixed and then cooked in the milk and cheese mixture it will absorb the moisture.  I prefer the roux sauce that covers macaroni more evenly, but this recipe is very good and was an excellent side to grilled halibut and a green salad.","1589071059","22"
"103709929","Pamela Evans","This will be my forever mac 'n cheese. Insanely good, especially around the edges and bottom where the cheese browned. But beware—it's Heart Attack City! So much yummy grease bubbled around the edges that I sprinkled Panko on it to sop it up, then baked a bit more. Reheats well, but do it slowly and lowly.","1574009301","21"
"110345747","Annelise","Took one for the team and tested out if you can prep this a day in advance then bake. Findings: yes, you can prep this the day before and leave in the fridge over night and bake the next day. Would recommend leaving out for one hour prior to baking. Only additional step: I mixed the pasta and cheese (already in the tray) again because the milk mixture sunk to the bottom which impacted the layer of Colby cheese in the middle. Everything else I did following the recipe and it turned out well!","1606508094","21"

"107267284","LCK","According to The Joy of Cooking, prior to the depression macaroni and cheese - often called ""baked macaroni"" -  was made with milk and eggs, as were many other recipes, and using a white sauce was an economical substitution. White sauces have a grainy, and when I use one, I keep adding cheese to the sauce, thinking it will become cheese-like. This recipe is a delicious custard base with a solidly ""cheesy"" quality because of the layered ingredients.","1590623093","18"
"107288724","Mary Paschall","O.M.G. So delicious. It was impossible to put the leftovers away as we just kept redirecting spoonfuls into our mouths. I had to substitute mozarella for the Colby Jack and I only had 2% milk on hand, but it was still delicious. That might explain why it was perhaps a little runny when it first came out of the oven but it firmed up within 15 minutes. I will make this again.","1590696567","18"
"103737114","Erica","Mine did not set. Tasted fine but was not creamy. It was very runny. Maybe too much milk?","1574133906","16"
"110860807","Kate Tillotson","Key to have the milk, butter and eggs room temp or you will have a greasy mess. Also. Shake all the water out of the pasta. Made w room temp stuff and it was amazing. Made a second time quickly w cold ingredients and it was a mess.","1609632492","16"
"107230365","EKSanfilippo","This was really good! Following some commenters advice I reduced the butter to half a stick (4T) and the milk to 1.5 cups. Felt lazy and didn’t even melt the butter, but cut it into chunks and stirred it in with the cheese.","1590500163","15"
"107262323","Suzabella","I may have to try this recipe.  At 78, I've become a bit of a lazy cook.  I've spent the majority of my life cooking.     So for my mac and cheese I boil the macaroni in salted water, drain, add grated parmesan, a splash of milk, about a table spoon of butter, sometimes sour cream when available, and then at least 2 cups of cheddar cheese. I let it start under medium heat, then switch to low to let the ingredients meld into a creamy dish.  My husband likes peas as a side dish","1590606923","15"
"103468596","Bruno","This came out with a bunch of liquid at bottom of the dish, pretty gross and inedible.  Had to drain most of the milk and add corn starch to make it an actual creamy mixture... would not recommend.","1572823371","14"
"107273257","Georgia Peach","Whisk eggs (2) and can of evap milk. Add a few dashes of hot sauce and a pinch of salt. Add freshly ground pepper (white) and cheeses. Stir in cooked al dente pasta and mixture in 9 x 13 casserole dish. Sprinkle with smoked Spanish paprika and cinnamon. Bake in 350*F oven 45 minutes, UNCOVERED. Take out of the oven and sprinkle with FRESH parmesan or a mix of Swiss and Gruyere. Place casserole on top rack to broil. Watch so it does not burn! Let it set up for a few minutes and serve. Bon appetit","1590658075","14"
"103089779","Stu","This is a super-simple version of mac 'n cheese that I'm sure is fine, but the best I've ever seen is Pierre Franey's recipe in the NYT from 1991 for the 60 Minute Gourmet column. I've made that recipe more times than I can count, and it's awesome. Much more complicated but fabulous.","1571069787","13"
"103655987","Erin","A rare miss for a NYT Cooking recipe. I’m currently looking at a soupy mix of cheese, egg, and butter underneath mostly naked, buttered noodles. The cheese is there, but it’s separate. I’ll stick to my roux-based recipe.","1573704367","13"
"103820122","Andi","This turned out runny. I would not make again.","1574553876","12"
"105646878","Joyce Leland","This is a fabulous recipe!  In reference to Dan Findley’s helpful information about borosilicate glass.

It can be found in select retailers throughout the US.","1583501275","12"
"109891688","Julie Robinson","If you really want this creamy, cook the elbows in the milk. In another pan, saute one finally chopped sweet onion until translucent, sprinkle 3 T of flour and 1 T of mustard powder on onion and cook for a minute.  Add the milk and elbows to the onion roux and add the cheese as noted.  Follow the rest of the recipe, or add all the cheese and top the mixture with the cheese, cover and simmer on the cooktop for a few minutes, turn off the heat and let it set for ten minutes, then devour.","1604078893","12"
"103212712","lauren","The sauce never came together. Chunks of melted cheese and watery sauce do not good Mac and cheese make.","1571667126","10"
"114009342","The pelicanist","Mac & Cheese is greatly improved by cooking the pasta in 1/2 water - 1/2 milk. Even at al dente, the pasta absorbs the milk and makes an even creamier result. Try it.","1628455728","10"
"103069485","cherise","The sauce never thickened up for me. Still great flavor but I did follow the recipe exactly. Should this have thin sauce?","1570932541","9"
"108053471","Jennifer","Delicious mac and cheese! Follow the directions and only cook the noodles for 4 minutes and it will not be runny; I did not have that issue. You do need to cool the noodles so they don't cook the eggs. I skipped the butter entirely since this is a very rich recipe and it was fine and did not stick to the pan. I also skipped the salt since this amount of cheese is very salty.","1594337726","9"
"115657866","Megan","I can honestly say that I wasn’t lactose intolerant until my husband made this on Thanksgiving and I woke up in the middle of the night in *agony*. That being said………..I may still have leftovers for lunch today. It’s that good. Like, unbelievably good. I know I’ll pay a price for it but I’d rather writhe for a few hours than let my husband eat the rest hahahaha","1637941423","9"
"106560342","EatFood","I know this is supposed to be rich and indulgent, but I found it to be unappetizingly greasy, leaving pools of grease on the plates and solidified grease puddles in the refrigerated dish of leftovers. Next time I will use half the stick of butter or less. There is already plenty of fat in the cheese!","1587246936","8"
"109331007","Amy H","Made this the first time just for the fam exactly as directed and it was BOMB.  Second time I doubled for a party, added a layer of lump crab meet on top of the colby jack, reduced salt to 1/2 t and sprinkled some Old Bay over crab before layering on mac mixture.  True crowd pleaser!","1601248615","8"

"120414875","Janice","I would add a few tablespoons of sherry when tossing the noodles, milk, eggs and cheese together before baking. The sherry brings out some of the nuttiness of the cheddar cheese.","1663210515","7"
"105967089","Neal","Made this tonight for the first time. I don't have much experience making oven-baked mac and cheese, so there were steps in the process where I thought, ""I'm not sure this is going to be good."" I needn't have worried. It was really good.","1584849263","6"
"107257064","Lee","A fabulously simple recipe. I tried it as written and it  was very good. I wanted to make it again recently but only had Dubliner cheese, so I went ahead with it. It was tremendous!","1590592496","6"
"107482196","Charles R. Whealton","It's funny.  I saved this recipe and it does so without the photo.  I looked up the difference between using the baking ""dish"" that the instructions say, versus metal as I now see up in the photo!  Anyway, I found a 9"" x 13"" Pyrex and all was well.  I'm out of my element in the kitchen so I didn't realize the box of elbow macaroni I purchased was 2 pounds instead of 1.  Luckily I figured it out before messing everything up!  It came out AWESOME. It'd be great to have good reheating instructions.","1591571477","6"
"109892672","Dee Ann","A little mustard powder really makes the cheese pop. although I am usually against eggs in macaroni and cheese because it can turn custard-y, this recipe is a winner because I don't have to make a roux or worry about the cheese sauce breaking. And it always seems to take forever to bring milk to a simmer for the sauce.","1604081603","6"
"110790451","David","As I wrote 11-months ago, black people tend to have this dish (""macaroni and cheese"" and not ""mac & cheese"" please!) on formal occasions. I prepared and served this dish for our Christmas dinner to accompany the ham. Remember: You may substitute cottage cheese for milk and add cayenne and mustard powder. My recipe calls for four-eggs.","1609179848","6"

"113318639","cookie monster","Mac n Cheese is a big deal in our household.  It’s a bi-weekly treat that everyone looks forward to.  The go-to recipe for years has been a traditional roux based recipe.  Never knowing if there’s something better, I decided to try this recipe.  My 12 year old son was so disappointed he actually cried after eating half his portion (he usually has 3rds).  While no one else cried, we all agreed it was terrible.  Most wound up as leftovers which got throw out out a few days later.","1624187142","6"
"114898348","Brittany","This is exquisite, and the complaints about stodginess seem like problems with following the recipe. Some commentary from the notes most helpful for me:   -1/2 stick of butter is plenty; a whole stick left a bit of extra grease around the edges (not that I'm complaining...)  -Forty minutes covered in my oven was perfect.  -A mix of extra sharp raw cheddar, gouda, and fresh mozz was decidedly decadent.  -Was it sacrilege to top and broil with pecorino? No, divine. -Cayenne, ground mustard!","1633629278","6"
"128818556","M OC","I‘ve been making our ‘macaroni bake’ like this for 40 years. I love that what is old is new again. A tip my great grandmother gave me was instead of rinsing the pasta, add a couple tablespoons of butter to the hot Mac to help them from sticking while they cool. I never rinse with water, because it removes all the starch that helps thicken. I, too, often add dry mustard and/or cayenne now and then, just as a variation. Along with collards, this is a meatless Monday favorite.","1698679469","6"
"128822815","Smyrna Gregg","The intent of rinsing the cooked macaroni is to halt the cooking but it also rinses off the starches that help the sauce form and adhere (as any Italian cook knows). Instead, start the pasta a little early, remove it al dente, and after shaking and draining thoroughly in a colander, transfer the pasta to an edged baking sheet and allow to cool naturally (and continue draining). Later, temper the room-temp egg/milk mixture with warm, melted butter before adding the cooled macaroni.","1698688403","6"
