"110310160","Lucinda","Two cups of heavy cream plus a stick and a half of butter? And presumably you’re going to be having turkey, dressing, gravy, rolls or biscuits, sides and dessert? I’m going to take the roasted garlic idea and skip the rest. And garlic roasts quickly if separated into cloves, tossed in olive oil and baked at 350° for 10-15 minutes.","1606277729","45"
"109627380","julia","Delicious. For the herbed cream, I used a bay leaf, a couple sage leaves, some thyme branches and a few smashed garlic cloves, just to up the garlic ante. I left everything whole since it was going to be strained anyway. Instead of garlic chips, I threw on some crispy (store-bought) shallots which eliminated a step.","1602712388","43"
"109850923","Cheryl","If you don't want to make the garlic chips yourself, almost all Asian grocery stores sell fried garlic in one form or another (Thai versions are my preferred ones) and that substitute well. They're also a must-have in a plethora of specific dishes, so they're great to keep on hand.","1603909449","25"
"110155919","John Manor","Dairy is the main issue when reheating. You could mash, season with salt and pepper and butter, then add warm cream/milk the day of. Or, perhaps, consider a recipe that makes mashed potatoes as a casserole, so all you have to do is reheat in the oven. (with some buttery panko and fresh herbs on top!)","1605480893","12"
"110274999","Grace","For the roasted garlic: 60 minutes at 380 cannot be beat, it comes out creamy and sweet (not at all burnt at the ends like mine has at 400).  If you are putting in the effort to roast garlic, you might as well make extra. Seasoned with salt and pepper before roasting, food processed with extra olive oil to taste, it becomes a delicious spread you can add to almost anything and lasts about a week in the fridge (much longer if frozen into cubes).","1606117013","12"
"110350217","Marty M","Wow...I have never said this about any recipe on this site, but, worst mashed potato recipe ever.  I followed the recipe perfectly (with red potatoes) and I ended up with a big gooey mess with overwhelming flavors. Maybe russets would have yielded a more desirable outcome.  In any case, way too much work and will not be repeating.","1606579569","8"
"110849312","JC Brown","This is a great recipe for savory  mashed potatoes. You can up the flavor of this dish by saving the olive oil from cooking the garlic chips and adding it to the mash - which makes this triple garlic mashed potatoes. Another easy flavor boost is to add a few cloves of garlic to the potato water and cook along w the potatoes - mash them in with everything else and you get quadruple garlic mashed potatoes. A perfect bed for Melissa Clark's Mushroom Bourguignon.","1609520987","8"
"115504751","Robert Wood","Just finished making this for Thanksgiving.  Made it. Froze it.   It tastes good, and I think the rosemary will complement the buttermilk-brined chicken I'll make (if you haven't tried that recipe, it's really, really good).    But, I'm also developing a theory about recipes, i.e., that some are overly complex for the resulting flavor.  This one got me thinking that way.  It's good, certainly, but it was also very time-consuming.  And, just good; not Wow! good.","1637009751","4"
