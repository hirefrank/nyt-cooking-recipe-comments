"103553932","mjan","In response to Vanessa:  2 teaspoons create a sauce.  2 tablespoons (in conjunction with 1 1/2  cups of stock and 1 cup of white wine would create more of a gravy.","1573182555","447"
"103613930","Stu","Searing aggressively for about  1-1/2 to 2 minutes per side, and finishing cooking in the sauce until an internal temperature of 143-145°F is reached is definitely the way to go. Don't go by time; use temperature to determine when cooked through. The interior should be pink and juicy, not grey. Use an accurate, instant-read thermometer for consistent results every time. Clocks are for telling time. Thermometers are for telling when food is cooked properly.","1573518190","422"
"103530357","Vanessa","Wondering if it should be 2 Tablespoons of flour. The sauce is really thin when the directions are followed.","1573090362","300"
"103580193","Paulo","Sounds good, but the thing is: Pork chops sold today are almost fat free, You can cook them any way you want, and you'd still have tasteless meat (and if well done, then they're really hideous, tasteless cardboard).  Switch to Pork shoulder (aka pork butt), cut it into 1 inch slices / steaks and cook / grill them with some oil, salt and pepper (or cook them according to this recipe but only 2 minutes per side). You'll never touch pork chops again.  PS: Costco has them for about $2/lb","1573305789","239"
"103532350","Kevin","I just saw this but basically cooked the exact same thing Tonite for dinner except with pounded chicken breasts, and it was phenomenal.  Only difference was I used dill instead of parsley, added a few slices of lemon into the reducing sauce, and did not use capers or zest.  I actually thought I should have added capers as we were eating.  Did not even think of doing this with pork though.  Can't wait to try it.","1573099452","213"
"103546508","Mojave Desert Rat","Jane, If you sear the pork chops first, mid- high heat. 4-5 minutes on both sides w/olive oil as noted in the recipe.  They should finish cooking through in the sauce.  Perhaps a few minutes extra if they're very thick cut chops.  Gone are the days of overcooked dried out pork.  Trichinosis isn't much of a work today. Try to purchase good quality Berkshire pork.","1573155075","184"
"103571690","Amy Saxton","Why drain the fat? That seems unlikely that anyone in real life would drain the fat...especially just to add a different fat back in.","1573246463","155"
"103723985","Mari","There is a danger with seasoning the chops with dried Thyme before frying them - the Thyme is likely to burn and end up adding bitter grains of charcoal to the resulting dish, ruining its taste. Instead, add the dried Thyme to the sauce with the wine and stock. I adjusted the dish slightly - I added medium-dry cider (alcoholic, as always in the UK) instead of wine and added a chopped leaf of fresh Sage instead of dried Thyme to the sauce. I also added the jus from the chops to the sauce. Great!","1574094140","147"
"103574971","Anne","Just made this - a lovely recipe with a great sauce. Here's a genius addition: chard stems. I had a bunch of them leftover after harvesting my chard and using only the leaves. I cut the stems into 3-4 inch lengths, and simmered them after adding the liquids in Step 2. I covered the pan and let them cook until tender - about 8-10 minutes, then I removed the cover and reduced the sauce. Everything else stayed the same. I served the pork chops on a bed of chard stems with the sauce covering it all.","1573257690","81"
"103579767","Uri","Thyme? Sage would be better. And why would you throw away all that flavour and caramelised fond in the cooking fat? Dust the chops in flour before you cook. Simpler and better.","1573303478","78"
"103552320","anne chaney","Served this tonight with mashed Japanese (white) sweet potatoes. Used 3 Tbsp. Flour but made no other changes. Parsley instead of the usual dill is genius. This is a recipe I will not tinker with.  Cooked the thick chops five minutes on a side so they didn’t toughen up. Might even do four minutes next time.  This is the first caper-lemon sauce I have ever really loved and with the sweet potatoes it was simply incredible!","1573174994","75"
"103583466","Caroline","I recently read an article about the magic of mayonnaise (eggs and oil really) and how you should lightly coat the meat before cooking to help it brown. I also read a tip to sear both sides but then to flip every minute or so to help brown. They came out nicely browned a juicy.","1573320779","71"
"103572494","Liz W.","Actually, it is done in France. This a roux, a fancy name for flour mixed with fat, which is the foundation for four out of the five French mother sauces.","1573249219","62"
"104887545","Ballen","Always a good idea to score the outer fat ring on the chops all the way through the fat to the loin.  This prevents them from curling in the pan.  Awesome dish!","1580328607","61"
"103568163","Utica NY food","I make a similar dish all the time.  Whisk a little Wondra into the sauce to thicken. Stoneground Dijon mustard is also a tasty addition.","1573237330","60"
"103521670","Jacob K.","How about posting the celery recipe?","1573058567","47"
"107187237","Chris","My kids don't like white wine in sauces. Besides, I didn't have any available because I drank it all. So I substituted 1T of apple cider vinegar. The zestiness of the sauce was a hit!","1590168134","47"
"103568772","KWarner","I think that is as it should be.  As noted by another poster, with the 2 tsps  you have a lovely sauce...2 tbs would be more of a gravy.  I guess in the end it depends on which you prefer.  You might try it once as written and make alterations afterwards to make it your own.","1573238949","44"
"109468074","Fran","This dish was super delicious.  My husband raved. I incorporated a lot of tips from other commenters: I dusted the chops with flour before cooking. I fried on high heat for 2 min and 15 seconds per side; I saved the thyme to put in with wine and chicken broth; I did not drain the fat (there wasn't much and it's full of flavor). I saved out some parsley & capers to sprinkle on when serving. Instead of hot sauce, I sprinkled with chili pepper flakes when serving for even more color. Beautiful!","1601840157","44"
"103588752","mmccall1960","Wonderful recipe. Cooked it as instructed and delicious. Chops need to be from a good butcher, not thin. Take your time to boil down the sauce with the liquid after gently whisking in the flour. I served with a rice and collards recipe — while the rice is at a low simmer put chopped collards on top in the same saucepan and when the rice is done so are the collards — and this was great. I grew up in NC but now live in Northern CA and this dinner made me happy. Thank you for this!","1573356742","36"

"103564635","Geoff G","I haven't made this yet, but on the first try I'm not going to drain the fat from the skillet.","1573229826","34"
"103581375","James A","I added ribbons of kale to the sauce after the liquid really gets going. Meat and veg in one pan!  Super delicious.   I wondered about potatoes as a side but did not need them.  Maybe a slice of crusty bread at the end to catch the last of the sauce.   Preserved lemon zest with the parsley, etc added complexity that fresh zest did not.  Mmm.","1573311722","27"
"109230071","EugeniaH","Merrick Dean:  Try buying a bottle of dry vermouth, which keeps a long time.  They come in smaller or larger sizes.  I always have dry vermouth (don't mistakenly buy sweet!) because I like martinis, and I don't want to open a good bottle of wine just for a couple of tablespoons.","1600721487","24"
"103860545","Paul","Lovely sauce; even better the next day. That being said, I agree with others that two tsp flour is not enough, nor is three. Next time: two tbsp. Also, an eight ounce bone-in pork chop is ca. 1/2 inch thick. The searing time is too long and risks drying out the chop. I reduced the time by half; it was still on the edge of too dry. Instead of medium high heat, I'd suggest high heat for about two minutes on each side.","1574790595","23"
"103567627","Mary","Agree with what MDR stated, if you cook them any longer they will be like shoe leather","1573235947","21"
"106823661","Isabel","One of the most flavorful sauces Ive made with pork chops. Delicious! I used close to 2 TBSP of flour for thickening & cooked it slowly & longer with the pork chops in sauce to make them more tender & flavorful. Added chicken broth as needed.  Used half the lemon juice & half of the capers in the simmering sauce. Saved the lemon zest, parsley & remaining half of the capers & added during the last few minutes of cooking to preserve their delicate flavors. Had to shoo my husband out of the kitchen","1588387917","18"
"103519024","Desert fox","Thank you for Nutritional Information.","1573051422","17"
"103706723","JJ","I will definitely make this recipe again. It was delicious. I changed nothing except that I accidentally put in 2 tablespoons flour instead of 2 teaspoons (advice, when you need reading glasses, use them). The recipe turned out perfect for me so I’ll probably always use 2 tablespoons.","1573997352","17"
"103583437","KinseyH","Rice, cooked as usual (sauté rice in oil, add same quantity of liquid as rice plus salt, bring to a boil, etc.) except: use stock for the liquid and, for each 3/4 cup rice, sauté 1 tsp whole fennel seed in the oil until fragrant first, add rice and sauté as usual, add 1 tsp turmeric and continue to sauté a minute or so more, add liquid and proceed as usual.  Variation, especially to accompany fish: double the fennel and omit the turmeric.","1573320643","15"
"103567581","Mary","It’s more of a buerre blanc than a thick gravy","1573235840","13"
"109469714","A cook in Crozet, Virginia","I made this tonight with two large-ish chops, but added other ingredients as written. Regrettably I had no parsley, and I used all chicken stock in lieu of stock and wine. Although there are similarities to piccata, the recipe yielded a lovely, robust brown sauce, and the addition of thyme was delightful. I cooked the chops as prescribed, and after warming in the sauce, they were slightly pink. Highly recommend!","1601858781","11"

"109222342","Karin","Interesting to know some of the history mentioned here but as a German born, I have to note that my mom made it often with mashed potatoes and red cabbage. Wonderful to see this again.","1600701002","9"
"103566065","Richard Schinella","This recipe is also similar to Romeo Salta's delicious recipe""Breaded Pork Chops with Caper Sauce"" from his 1962 cookbook 'The Pleasures of Italian Cooking', which is one of my favorites. I'll try this version the next time I cook pork chops.","1573232664","6"

"112969519","FH Cyclist","Sauce was excellent.  Changes-based on others’ & my suggestions....  1: added thyme in with wine & stock 2: sprinkled flour on both sides of the chops 3: I brine pork chops, to keep them moist, by salting both sides w/ kosher salt & refrigerating 1-2 hours. No add’l salt @ time recipe says  4: Scored fat  5: used Pinot Gris for sauce since my choice to have w/ dinner. 6: used meat thermometer to 140.  7: left fat & EVOO in pan.  Would use this sauce with chicken & fish.  Had with sweet potato.","1621826276","5"
"118891093","CathyM","Excellent!!  Will definitely do again but agree with the other notes below: dust the chop with the s&p and flour, sear max 4 min.  Did not drain the fat, instead used 1/2 the butter listed and browned the shallot and garlic.  I added 1 tbsp of flour so it wasn't gravy, but not as thin if you only used 2 tsp.  Deglazed the pan with wine, stock and thyme.  After it almost reduced, added the chops back to the pan to finish cooking.  Finished as written but didn't add the extra butter to sauce.  yum","1655686480","5"
"103678420","Anne C.","Delicious! I halved the recipe for 2, and used less chicken stock and wine after reading the comments about how long it took to reduce. It was perfect. I was concerned the chops would not be cooked in this small time but they were, and remained moist and tender after spending time in the sauce. Served it with mashed potatoes and sliced mushrooms cooked in the sauce.","1573802836","4"
"116776129","KC in MN","I don’t make porch chops often but this has become my go to preparation.  As others note, any leftover sauce brightens up fish, chicken or other veggies like broccoli, cauliflower, or asparagus.  I cut the last butter addition by  1 T and don’t miss it.","1644197797","4"

"118684013","Barry Warner-Hudson","The winner in this one is the sauce, lemony delish.  No doubt would also work for chicken breasts.  Cooked it pretty much straight up as directed.  Served with creamy mashed potatoes and steamed endive and bok choy.  Smothered everything and it's brother in that sauce.  Definitely a repeater.","1654567088","3"
