"103699510","Dana","This was quite tasty. I’m not sure what Gastons are hanging out in the NYT test kitchen but IMO it could serve 6-8. Also took far long than 30 min - even applying my “I’m spastic with a knife and lucky to have all my fingers” discount rate. Recommend cooking the meatballs close to done in the pan (had to simmer 30  mins...). I used turkey and added an egg and 1/2c panko for binding (meatballs were falling apart).","1573935497","991"
"103712523","Chris B","Excellent.  I cooked the meatballs in a 425F oven, on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper.  Less fuss and easier clean-up.  I used Thai peppers, had some frozen from last summer, probably more than a single jalapeno.","1574021844","799"
"104388052","Ryan","1. Double jalapeño (next time probably will triple.) 2. Add 1 egg and 1/2c panko to the meatballs. 3. 4c chicken stock with 1 container of coconut milk. (Probably again would increase the stock next time.) 4. Reduce the size of the meatballs by half. 5. Bake meatballs at 425 for 20 min.","1577845074","700"
"103762135","EKSanfilippo","Not sure what wizard could have this on the table in 30 minutes, but I tip my hat to them.","1574281031","665"
"109520346","Jo Jo","Gosh more than 430 comments here. If anyone actually sees this, let it be known and I followed the recipe to the T and it came out fabulous! The flavors here are deep. Yes the meatballs felt a little sticky to the hand, but they were not sticking to the Dutch oven when I browned them so it all worked out great. Meatballs were done in about ten minutes. Completed this meal in about 45 working as fast as I could -definitely not 30. Go for it, recipe needs no tweaking!","1602091528","424"
"104733612","Alison","If you have a small food processor, definitely use that. I blitzed up the ginger, jalapeño, and garlic in it, scraped it out and then did the cilantro. Significantly cut down on the prep time for the meatballs.","1579620762","410"
"103847211","Lee","It’s a cruel joke saying this takes 30 minutes - especially for those of us trying to plan quick weeknight meals! After all the chopping and cooking the meatballs (25 min alone), this will easily end up being an hour. The recipe is great but pls be realistic on timing!!","1574727849","370"
"109908883","Lizzie D","Do you have a cold and are stoned? Pay your roommate $100 and ask them to make this for you. Tell them to use a good stock and follow the recipe.","1604199243","304"
"103701858","Jen Nichol","Very tasty but if you’re expecting some heat, increase the jalapeños! I went ahead and added lemon grass to the broth because I’m a fan. Made 6 - 8 servings, took longer than 30 mins, closer to an hour (though I never rush when trying new recipes).","1573949617","285"
"103810251","Tess","This was really good! Made a few modifications.  Followed others’ suggestions to add half a cup Panko and 1 egg to the meatballs and baked them for 20 min at 425. Also added baby bokchoy and shittakes. Tripled the broth, as there was hardly enough for it to be considered soup. Quartered the meatballs and served over rice noodles with a generous amount of broth.","1574480918","277"
"103920321","Clh","This was delicious! Made it for my husband’s birthday dinner. I added an egg and panko to the meatballs. And put them in the freezer for 2-3 hours before cooking them. Not enough broth!! Add at least 6-7 cups of broth!  Also freeze the jalapeño before grating it. Garlic press the garlic. I will make this again! I added kieffer lime leaves and ginger stalk to simmer in the soup. Pair with white wine! Albariño, viognier, French Pouilly- Fuissé ...","1575253219","223"
"103925644","emily","sometimes when you make a dish that's supposed to last you a few days, you know you'll be sick of it the moment it's done. that's definitely not the case with this soup -- i'm so excited to have made this for the week's dinner!  i added the 1 egg and 1/2 cup panko to the meatballs (i used turkey instead of chicken) and cooked in the oven at 425 for 20 mins, as others suggested.  i would definitely double the broth and add a bit more jalapeño for a better kick -- my roommate added siracha to hers","1575303562","127"
"103712033","Sharon Lansing","NYT Notes:   I used turkey and added an egg and 1/2c panko for binding (meatballs were falling apart.  > Add more jalapenos if you like heat.  > Takes more than 30 min to cook through meatballs.","1574018898","106"
"103980225","Michael","Do NOT attempt to make without the fish sauce like I did! You'll end up with some bland, murky broth with meatballs in it.","1575520029","94"
"103716160","Deetroi","Since it was a meal for two, I made this tonight using 1lb of chicken but made the whole recipe for the soup.  It gave us more soup to use with the rice and meatballs, I’m not sure if there would be enough liquid for 2 lbs of chicken.  I also substituted Penzey’s dried jalapeño and it was fine.","1574051659","92"
"106550976","Jules","I was wondering why lemongrass is left out! I’ll add that, shallots, and Thai basil when I make it :)","1587184219","66"
"103907970","LizS","Agree, this is yummy. I added lime zest with the juice, it kicked up the flavors.  Next time I will add lemongrass to the broth and keep more jalapeno seeds for heat. Great recipe!!","1575155660","52"
"103920533","Cocktailhour","Very tasty.  Used pork, 1.3 lbs and enough for 2 meals (or 4 people).  Baby bok choy instead of spinach.  1 thinly sliced shallot.  4 c broth.  I added the bok choy stems and shallots with liquids; next time add later.  Next time, I will add more ginger to broth and more heat with extra jalapeno or sambal oleck.","1575255691","44"
"103865212","Justin","""Using the small holes of a box grater, or a Microplane, grate the ginger, garlic and jalapeño (or finely chop them by hand)."" - Literally the first line in the instructions","1574804258","40"
"103901961","esther","I made this with lite coconut milk since I'm watching my weight and it was quite good. Definitely will make again. I used jasmine rice.","1575084636","37"
"111090503","Melanie","This is so good! Like lots of people have suggested, I tried baking the meatballs in the oven, but having done it both ways I prefer doing it as written. Cooking them on the stove gives you the brown bits on the bottom of the pot that lend a depth of flavor to the broth that's missing when you bake. Didn't bother with the egg and panko, meatballs were a bit sticky but stayed together fine. Definitely takes longer than 1/2 hour, took me closer to a full hour.","1610596813","37"
"104032341","nicolette","Really good - does take an hour Adds when making the broth: - added some gochujang when frying up the garlic jalapeño and garlic mixture for a little extra flavor - added some thinly sliced sweet onion and softened before adding the broth  - served over some pad thai noodles","1575768230","32"
"110696273","Anna","This is SO good.  I made it twice with the meatballs, and thereafter I now just use diced chicken tossed with this spice blend: The Gourmet Collection Spice & Seasoning Blend, Thai Style Green Curry- Amazon.  Small other alteration- I put the spinach in the bowls with the rice and then pour the soup over. This keeps the spinach bright and fresh for leftovers.","1608506665","28"
"104717206","Hannah","As a vegetarian, I made this with beyond ground meat and it was outstanding. 10/10 would recommend. Reheated well the next day, too.","1579478698","27"
"103751627","Melissa M.","This soup is delicious but I recommend doubling the broth as there is not enough. I halved the chicken to 1lb as well as the garlic, jalapeño, and ginger. Made the broth as stated but wishing I had more!","1574210952","26"
"109759635","judy","I made this exactly as written.  Fabulous.","1603454674","23"
"111006967","kim","Highlight of this is the meatballs! What I used from Others:  Use a food processor for the garlic ginger jalapeño  Add the one egg and 1/2 cup panko to meatballs Bake meatballs at 425 for 20 mins on parchment (made 24 meatballs)  - add shiitake mushrooms to broth when bringing it to simmer.  - use 4 c homemade chicken stock , 1 can coconut milk    another tbsp fish sauce and another 1/2 lime in broth b/c stock increased   Leftover white rice   meatballs and pour broth over top.  YUM!","1610241338","23"
"103936516","christine","I think I’ll use thin flat rice noodles in the broth instead of rice on the side.","1575355122","21"
"103709724","MICHELE","Do you have to brown the meatballs? I have traditionally booked them right in the soup or sauce","1574008517","20"
"105484003","David","Delicious! I seeded the jalapeno, so there wasn't much heat to the finished product. Add more spinach if you like spinach--5 ounces ends up not being a lot. No eggs and no bread crumbs, and the meatballs held together just fine.","1582834239","20"
"104004506","MWnyc","One could save some time on this recipe by using garlic paste and ginger paste (or garlic-ginger paste), which one can often find in the international aisle of supermarkets.  And, frankly, I'd just add sriracha rather than taking the trouble to grate a fresh jalapeno or a couple of Thai green chilies.","1575614754","15"
"110560299","Mimi Newman","I was too lazy to make meatballs myself - used frozen IKEA meatballs lol - still absolutely delicious","1607712471","14"
"110852097","Zenna","This recipe is fantastic as a jumping off point. And by following everyone's suggestions, it was incredible!  1. Definitely triple the broth. I doubled it and regret not making more.  2. Double the aromatics and add lemongrass 3. Add 1/2 cup panko and 1 egg to the meatballs. I froze half of them for next time I make the soup. We'll see how that turns out 3. Add about 1/4 cup sugar 4. Add chili flakes for heat 5. Let simmer for a couple hours 4. I added mushrooms and bok choy at the end Amazing!","1609535091","12"
"111036297","Dj The great PNW","Not if frozen. I keep jalapeños in the freezer, along with ginger, which is far easier to great if frozen","1610392014","12"
"111091029","Zoe","Made this last night and I’m a fan. One kid doesn’t like coconut, so I substituted almond milk. I didn’t have time to batch the meatballs, so I baked them at 425 for 20 min. The meatball mixture was very wet, but that made for tender meatballs. I accidentally left out the salt, which was fine. I used 4 c vs 2 c of broth and added an extra 1/2-1 tablespoon of fish sauce. Next time, I will leave a few of the jalapeño seeds in for a little extra kick. I served it over udon noodles.","1610599836","12"
"111155977","INP","Excellent soup, we loved it. Only comment that I have is total prep time and cooking is about 1 hour, taking into account grating or chopping ingredients, mixing and cooking. 30 minutes its truly the amount of time that it takes to cook. I removed the jalapeño seeds and white veins next time I will leave some for some added spice.","1611008138","12"
"111131298","Wendy","Outstanding!  I found the recipe nearly perfect.  It takes longer than 30 minutes for sure, but the ingredients and portions work well together.  Handling the meatball mixture is gooey, but they fry up nicely.  Be patient, let them brown throughly before turning.  They came out moist and scrumptious.  I would not call it a brothy soup.  More like a well moistened rice with meatballs.  To add more heat/spice simply use hot chilies for condiments.","1610807637","11"
"103935762","Abby","Doubled broth, 4 cups stalk and 1.5 cans coconut milk. Probably a mistake on my part— it was too rich. Served with rice noodles which paired well with the dish. The meatballs were delicious! I would make those again. However, the broth was nothing special.","1575347099","9"
"111157703","Marsha","Mostly followed directions.  Used a small food processor for ginger, garlic, and seeded jalapeño... saved time.  Made meatballs as directed... let the mixture sit for about 10 min before browning. No issues with falling apart.  Sweated leeks before adding garlic mixture, then broth. Used 22 oz. coconut milk and 6 c. chicken stock... added powdered bullion to taste and salt. Taste your broth as you cook! Awesome.","1611021616","9"
"111026232","Whitney","I pressure cooked the meatballs in my Instapot with some additional stock. I used the meatball ingredients as written. I used high pressure for 6 minutes and natural release for 5 mins.  After cooking I combined the remaining stock from the pressure cooker into the stock/coconut milk combination on the stovetop. The meatballs were fully cooked - very hot and tender - and did not need additional time to cook within the soup as the baked or pan-seared meatballs might.","1610371588","8"
"111127261","maggie h","This is a family favorite.  I have followed the recipe exactly many times, but I agree with other cooks that you can get away with baking the meatballs if you like.  I spray the tops of the meatballs with a bit of olive oil, bake at 450 until just browned then toss them in the sauce to finish cooking.  Easy clean up and no oil splatter.","1610752491","8"
"109879961","Lisa","Made exactly as stated, delicious. Meatballs did not require any additions to form beautifully and stay together.","1604017713","7"
"111110564","Jhc","You know how this recipe says full fat coconut milk? Use full fat coconut milk. If you’re looking to cut a calorie or two, cook your meatballs in an air fryer (400 degrees; 10 minutes) instead.","1610678385","7"
"111118743","AMReing","I agreed with some others in that the meatball to soup ratio was a bit off.  I added more ingredients to get more broth.  Next time I will halve the meatball mixture and make smaller balls.  Great soup! Everyone enjoyed their meal.  I also added sliced shitake mushrooms along with the spinach and a bit of lemongrass paste.  Delicious!  I look forward to making this again.","1610725943","7"
"111125334","Linda","1/15/21. Good as I did it; worth tweaking more!  I used a large Serrano Chile; next time would use 1.5–2.  Used one pound ground turkey breast but kept all other proportions the same.  Next time I’d try ground pork.  I added an egg and a handful of panko and baked on parchment-lined cookie sheet at 420 for 20 minutes, rotating pan half-way through.  Skip the panko.  The veggies in broth need dimension.  Bok choy would be good.  Maybe some shredded carrot?  Green onions?  More cilantro?","1610743768","7"
"111040326","Richard","The description lists lemon grass, lime leaves, and galangal.   But they are not in the ingredient list or in the instructions.  I don't see anything Thai about it except coconut milk.","1610405091","6"
"111077937","Charles","Not a huge fan of cilantro, so replaced with chopped spinach. Also reduced the chicken broth to about a cup and served with rice, so it was more of a curry. Quite good.","1610557331","6"
"111127168","Lindsay Griffin","So delicious!... but only a 30 min meal if you have a prep chef to grate, chop, mix everything for you. I split the batch and did half chicken and half Impossible ground meat b/c my husband is vegetarian. We all agreed the Impossible meat made a heartier dish.  Either way I will make this again for sure, just not as a school night quick meal unless I have prepped all the components in advance. I like the idea of doing the meatballs in the oven too - less mess!","1610751964","6"
"111128618","Andi from Austin","Added an egg and panko crumbs, cooked in the oven at 425 for 20 minutes on parchment paper, 4c chicken stock and full can of coconut milk, used kale instead of baby spinach","1610761161","6"
"111144763","Stacey","Any substitute for cilantro? I'm one of those people where it tastes like soap. Recipe calls for so much of it, wondering what else I could use.","1610913453","6"
"111151766","Constance Castle","Perhaps an egg added to the ground chicken would hold them together a bit better.  They were falling apart.  The scent in the kitchen is fabulous.  My partner and I loved the dish.  Will make it again.  Certainly   took me more time than the stated 30 minutes.","1610985494","6"
"111157180","Elizabeth","This is a keeper. I baked the meatballs, added more broth, and adjusted seasonings accordingly. Delicious.","1611017887","6"
"110443399","Michael","Made 1x with ground chicken. Great. Made 1x with ground turkey. Do chicken :(","1607067180","5"
"110846607","Dan","Took closer to an hour than 30 minutes.  I would love to see the video of the 30 minute version.","1609511764","5"
"110862453","Leilani","I’ve made this twice now, and it’s always a hit. I see no need for panko or egg in the meatballs; I make mine pretty big and they stay together beautifully, moist and fluffy. I add three tablespoons of fish sauce to the chicken (I did it on accident the first time, but loved the flavor so much). Grating everything definitely takes the most time. Maybe one day I’ll try using a food processor, I just hate to use more dishes. Otherwise, this is DELICIOUS!","1609648175","5"
"105277347","Rebecca","Commenters would have you believe every recipe is flawed in some way and in need of their modifications. Don't believe it.   You can make this as-is and it's quite fine.","1581985143","4"
"110686353","MK","We make this vegan by replacing the chicken with ground Impossible ""meat"" and coconut aminos instead of fish sauce. We also do agave instead of sugar. It is AMAZING and we cook it every other week. Also, we tried it with Beyond ""meat"" and the impossible was closer to a chicken meatball. (I am new to vegetarianism and was paleo before...)","1608419683","4"
"111074368","MdL","Delicious! But 30 minutes?! LOL...maybe in a service kitchen with staff...","1610550651","4"
"111137025","Nancy","Made this exactly as written. IT WAS EXCELLENT.","1610844930","4"
"111156969","Sri","Keeper of a recipe. Added 1/2 cup Panko, an egg to the meatballs and increased the number of chilies. Also added 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes to the meatball mix. Yipped the broth to 5.5 cups. Added lime zest to the broth while simmering. Skipped the spinach, added him chit and Cremini mushrooms. Broiled the meatballs on 2 sheet pans. Yep definitely not a 30 minute recipe but it was worth it.  Line juice a must at the end.","1611016116","4"
"103712908","Anna","This was delicious -my three year old said ""Mom, you should be a chef!"" which I think is the peak of praise.  We didn't use jalapeno, and substituted parsley for cilantro.  Also added a few splashes of soy sauce in both the meatballs and the broth.  Meatballs were so tender - will definitely make again.","1574024810","2"
"110092512","Rony","LOVE this. Made as written the first time, then this: xtra ginger & garlic plus whole jalapeño ADD lemongrass into food processor. Baked meatballs for 15 min at 425, then fried them in coconut oil to brown another side. This was perfect. Double the sauce and add lemongrass! Added extra lime juice at the end and removed tops of lemongrass stalks from the sauce before serving.","1605130650","2"
"110272266","linda","Very good - I had no trouble with the meatballs and was glad I made them on the stovetop. The broth benefited from all the brown bits that were left in the bottom of the pan. As written, its more like a sauce to eat over rice. A soup would require a lot more broth.","1606083990","2"
"110770420","Completley fell apart while frying","Used soy sauce instead of fish sauce, other than that I followed the recipe exactly and was delicious! I do agree with others that there’s not enough broth to be considered a soup. did not find the meatballs needed an egg and Panko, they still held together nicely without. definitely making this again very soon!","1609001806","2"
"110888927","Lindsay","I added about 6-8 cups of broth instead of 2 cups to the recipe (I had just made a large batch of 36hr+ chicken bone broth and wanted to ingest it!) I also added an extra can of coconut milk (2 can total)! This worked really well and created the right ratio of broth-to-meatballs for my taste, poured over rice. I just added an extra inch of ginger and a bit more fish sauce. I also liked how the amount of broth mellowed out the spice of the jalapeño (I added the whole thing, seeds included.) YUM!!","1609788322","2"
"111006828","Christine","A very tasty and easy dish.  I thought the meatballs were a bit dry, so I think next time I will try other's suggestions to a  add an egg.  I used one lb of meat but kept the liquid the same,  and that worked out well.","1610240679","2"
"111049331","Luther","A fabulous recipe. Not been a big fan of chicken meatballs, but these...I'd fixed this many times just for the meatballs! A plethora of tastes levels. As many ahead of me have said the 1/2 cup panko and 1 egg does help immensely for binding. Did the bake thing for the meatballs, but next time will go the fry route to check out taste change, if any. REALLY LOVE this recipe. One of the best I've gotten from NYT Cooking. Well done Ms. Slagle...well done indeed.","1610456451","2"
"111067902","TXcook","Used freshly ground chicken thigh meat, 1/2 c. Panko and an egg in the meatballs. Ground ginger, garlic, jalapeño in mini-chopper and baked meatballs on parchment paper in a 425 oven for 20 minutes. My family wanted it more stew than soup so just used the 2 c. Chicken stock with a can of reduced fat coconut milk. Garnished with chopped peanuts. Delicious - a keeper.","1610513235","2"
"111093666","LB","This had so much yummy flavor!  Definitely going to repeat this recipe.  I agree though, it does not take 30 minutes.  I would budget at least 45-1 hr.  and I baked them on a sheet in the oven as well.  They all fit on one sheet and much easier clean up.","1610627428","2"
"111094483","Chris","Absolutely delicious!  Added minced lemongrass to the meatballs and broth because I had some, used sambal oelek because I didn’t have jalapeño, and tossed in sliced mushrooms and a few kaffir lime leaves as well.  Would have been good without these modifications.  Whole family loved it.  Absolutely agree with others that this was not a 30-min meal - took me more than an hour, start to finish, and I’m not a beginner.","1610631218","2"
