"104954981","Randy","@Cassie: Shrimp will turn rubbery and flavorless if cooked ahead and reheated...not good.  To make ahead: Make marinade but DO NOT add the shrimp. Make the leek & bean stew. Both can be done ahead and held in the refrigerator (cooled & covered) without deteriorating. Just before serving, reheat the stew, marinate the shrimp, saute the shrimp in butter just until they turn pink and then add them to the stew. The shrimp will be tender and the stew will be perfect.","1580609314","1633"
"104953414","Mimi","Make a quick shrimp stock with shrimp shells to use in place of chicken stock: 1TBS veg oil warmed in pan, add shells and sauté for 3 min. Add 1/4C dry white wine and 1 3/4 water to pan with celery leaves and lemon peel if you have. Simmer for 10 min. Drain through sieve into pan with leeks and beans.","1580603478","1371"
"109190354","andrea","Made this exactly according to the recipe and it may be the best thing I ever cooked in my life — I’m 71.","1600475826","776"
"104934811","Caroline","Lovely! I traded shallots for leeks and added a bag of spinach for more greens. Served with some garlic naan on the side.","1580514587","742"
"110402276","fill my grave with this stew","i'm going to be real, i eat this whole thing in one meal.","1606872617","501"
"104898255","Natalie","This was really quick and delicious, but next time I would use slightly less shrimp, more beans, and more broth. I used a half of an onion instead of leeks because that is what I had on hand and it tasted great.","1580392221","450"
"104933524","Michael","I wonder if adding a bit of white wine and letting it cook down before adding the broth would add a nice flavor to it ....","1580510307","306"
"104897566","Shelley","This was easy to prepare as a week night meal and quite delicious. I followed the recipe as written except that I used about 5-6 cloves of garlic. My husband felt it needed more beans, so next time I make it, I will use two cans. I sautéed the shrimp in two batches to avoid overcrowding the pan. I also made some penne rigate as I thought rigatoni is too large. The rigate was the perfect size and a good addition to add some heft for those wanting a heavier meal. Definitely a keeper.","1580390495","172"
"104891101","Jeff Mullen, Ohio","This is the rare recipe that I could smell and taste as I read it. I made it for my family tonight. They were wowed. I served it over linguine with torn, toasted French bread to sop the juice. I made one change. I wanted the lemon juice in the marinade. So I put it in with the shrimp marinade and reserved it. When the recipe calls to add the lemon juice, I added the reserve marinade. The whole recipe took about an hour, not 30 minutes. But one of the best.","1580346991","153"
"104893519","Sanjay","My wife and I loved this. Thinking of swapping in shallots for leeks next time to speed up the prep.","1580357760","150"
"104890926","Jennie VT","Oh, yum! Made this tonight in about an hour, served with crusty bread and a good pinot noir. Flavors are bold, rich and satisfying, the beans add heft and creaminess and the lemon juice adds a fine note of brightness. I increased the lemon zest to the entire lemon's worth (about a Tablespoon) because I love that flavor and decreased the salt and pepper added to the shrimp to 1/2 teaspoon each, which to my taste was plenty. This is so good, the two of us almost finished it off!","1580345760","133"
"104912272","SM","Delicious and simple, only thing I would change is cooking time of shrimp to 1-2 mins, slightly undercooked. Before adding to sauce. Or even cooking shrimp separately and adding to sauce immediately after cooking for 2-3 mins.","1580428207","129"
"108357469","Lisa","Fast, easy and tasty.  A stick-to-your ribs kind of meal (as in very filling).  Made for 2  with 1/2 lb. shrimp, 1 can of Great Northern Beans, and 1/2  of a large onion instead of leeks.","1595940678","98"
"104938650","kmm","A really good recipe! I followed the advice of another cook and added a second can of cannellini beans. I also made a quick stock with the shrimp tails, and supplemented it with a bit of veggie broth to make 2 cups instead of using chicken broth, but otherwise followed the recipe. We loved it, and it came together quickly.","1580528241","96"
"104952646","Jill","Excellent and easy. I used fennel instead of leeks because that’s what I had on hand and we love fennel. It worked beautifully. I’ll definitely make this again.","1580600699","93"
"108607873","keep it simple","Add the shrimp and marinade last instead. The shrimp cook well in the broth and it’s easier than putting shrimp in and taking shrimp out.","1597282224","47"
"109004118","NancyBelle","Made this last night for two so halved the recipe.  Followed another reader’s advice to use the tails to make a stock with the shells, white wine, celery leaves, carrots and lemon peel.  I added this to part chicken broth and part water.  I also added a bit more of the beans than called for (I made mine from dry beans simmered with a rind of Parmesan and bay leaf and garlic).  I have to say this recipe was outstanding.  Served over pasta and it was delicious but I’ll use the grilled bread next!","1599495142","42"
"112410545","Autumn","Deglaze the pan with some white wine after browning the leeks and before adding the remaining ingredients. Really kicks the flavors up a notch.","1618328972","42"
"104954604","Audra","We really enjoyed this dish, but I agree with the previous comments about adding more beans & broth than the recipe calls for. Also we were running low on shrimp, so we actually added some cod in too and it turned out great!","1580607731","39"
"108799311","Susan Margaret","Really good! Used Rancho Gordo “Marcella” beans (more than recipe calls for). No leeks, so used some onion. Reduced the butter to about 1 tablespoon and added olive oil. Marinated shrimp and bay scallops in 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika, garlic, salt, pepper, lemon zest and juice; did not cook separately but added to broth and beans to cook near the end. Two cups of broth is just right, especially as I used more beans. Added some preserved lemon and a dollop of harissa, fresh dill and basil.","1598324412","38"
"105101005","boognish","It's to remove some of the starch and salt. Some beans tend to take on a metallic flavor when coming out of a can, and I find that rinsing can reduce that flavor as well.","1581139452","32"
"108551999","c","I took readers' comments to heart, and made with 1/2 onion (only two of us here), no oil no butter, simply softened in a couple of tbsps water, full can of beans (rinsed), seafood stock instead of either chicken or vegetable. Shrimp w/sweet paprika. Added baby spinach to off-heat pot, just so it wilted. Very nice! Quick too.","1597013715","27"
"115888906","Tom","Love this recipe. We’ve made it many times. Shallots instead of leeks just because that’s what we usually have around. We also add a bunch of kale or other greens before the beans. Once the greens are wilted, just keep on with the recipe as written. A little extra lemon juice won’t hurt either. And our toasted bread has garlic, Parmesan, and herbs. Great dish. Having it again tonight.","1639352984","27"
"112104604","Dash","I added some Dijon mustard and it really popped it up.","1616371871","23"
"114803279","Laura T","Made recipe with the following tweaks.  Doubled the lemon zest ( I love a lemony flavor) Added a 1/3 cup of white wine and reduced stock by 1/3 cup Added an extra can of white beans Added spinach per a suggestion by another person  The recipe came out amazing. This is going into my regular rotation for sure.","1633129358","21"
"116176488","Dan","Delicious but no way does this make 4 servings. This barely fed two adults and one 5 yr-old (we were still hungry). Next time I will double the recipe.","1641227088","19"
"108277442","Alan C Brownmd","I almost never change a recipe. It is the law as far as I am concerned. But today I made a quick shrimp stock with the shells and tails plus celery carrot and onion. It is so easy how could you use canned chicken stock. Since I got this recipe mixed up with the summer shrimp scampi which was right next to it, I threw in the corn kernels from the corn I had bought for tte other recipe. Great addition.","1595457593","18"
"110853914","Esther","Made as written ... licked the bowl","1609555501","17"
"108666228","Todd of Seattle","I hope you have better days ahead, friend.","1597634995","16"
"111086485","john","I roasted a pint of cherry tomatoes in olive oil and garlic cloves for an hour or so before. They caramelize nicely and can be added when you add the shrimp back in at the end. Similarly, I roasted the the leeks for a bit in the oven to soften them. Lastly, I’d also recommend adding an additional can of beans, and smashing some in the pot to get a nice consistency.","1610582076","16"
"123014180","chef eugene","This recipe alone makes the subscription worth it.","1675635803","16"
"104964117","Tim Carroll","Very good. Served over angel hair pasta.","1580661308","15"
"110647573","Eleanor","I added artichoke hearts.","1608169907","14"
"104969636","Alex A.","Major love!! This was our super ball dinner!! We all loved it. Used less shrimp and it worked just . Also doubled the lemon zest & worked beautifully. Will definitely do it again.","1580695281","12"
"107732618","ccookngwlove","Instead of leeks may substitute onions and spinach, deglaze with white wine","1592882214","11"
"104890521","sue","Forgot the note about adding other proteins of course, anything works. I will try chicken and tofu. This is such an anythings goes basic recipe and delicious.","1580343318","9"
"111516667","Sia","I used two cans of cannelini beans and an extra quarter pound of shrimp. I left the tails on the shrimp because I think they add flavor. I blended about a quarter of the beans and stock putting my immersion blender directly in the pot a couple of minutes before adding the shrimp. This gave the broth a velvety texture. So yummy! It’s definitely going in the weekly rotation!","1613005630","9"
"111675557","birdpants","SO GOOD! I’m a snob about homemade fresh everything and I don’t even like beans. Frozen shrimp, boxed broth, boxed beans—it was still spectacular. I served it over gluten free egg tagliatelle and next time will add artichoke hearts.","1613866771","9"
"109721669","Crookeygirl","Made this as instructed except that I followed @Rand's advice to cook shrimp last and add at the end. This was delicious. I loved the bright lemon flavor. Topped it off with a bit off hot oil at serving. This recipe would be so great with sausage in place of shrimp.","1603257909","8"
"111607513","Rachel Beck","I made this but decided as it was cooking that pureeing the beans/leeks would make a delicious soup. So I threw that into the blender after it cooked for about 10 minutes, and then put the shrimp on top. Amazing!!!","1613526205","8"
"115038984","David Tanis tartine","Making the leek & bean stew ahead was great. I had guests and it only took a quick shrimp sauté to finish the dish. I put the cooked shrimp in the stew and reduced the sauté liquid by half,  squeezed an extra lemon over all at the end. (Lemon olive oil was a great addition.) I would use dried beans next time and watch how long they cooked carefully.","1634447735","8"
"130010818","SteBie","I’ve experimented with the recipe a bit and have leaned the following: - you can use only half the butter and it still works out great - if you double the recipe, use one can of white beans and one can of garbanzo beans if you like more bite - tastes delicious when chicken broth is replaced with seafood stock (store bought) - Instead of using just plain paprika, use a mix of plain, smoked, and hot Hungarian paprika (in a pinch, you can use old bay seasoning) - It always takes an hour (not 30 min","1703389883","8"
"111207978","Craig in San Francisco","What a great, quick recipe. And like others have commented, it’s so versatile.   Recently I added some veg that was past its prime with great results:  - half a fennel bulb, chopped, along with with the leeks - some roughly torn radicchio leaves and a little bit of fresh marjoram at the very end  It was delicious!   Thanks, everybody, for sharing your comments.","1611294024","7"
"111703374","Elaina","This was wonderful. I added more garlic and 1 cup more broth. I also poured 1/2cup Chardonnay over the cooked leeks and simmered it until reduced before adding broth. I also finely grated a bit of  pecorino and melted it into the simmering broth. So easy and yet fancy enough for the best occasions. This is a keeper!","1614044354","7"
"114884484","Mose","I always forget to look at the notes!  I definitely would have added another can of beans. I also would have added some greens: spinach, chard, etc.  It was delicious as written but could have used a bit more.","1633562048","6"
"115266511","Leland","Very yummy. Finished each bowl with some red pepper flakes and olive oil.","1635647143","6"
"115669415","SarahT","So, so good!! Followed the recipe very closely. Used olive oil rather than butter. Cooked the shrimp until almost done, then finished at the end. Not rubbery at all! Used clam juice rather than chicken/vegetable stock, but homemade shrimp stock would be even better. Served over linguine as suggested by another commenter. This will be on a regular rotation for us!","1638062985","6"
"117698604","Julie","When we saw how much sauce there was we decided to make rice - that wasn't the right choice!  It muted the flavors of the dish.  Then I pondered making half the amount of the sauce.  By the end of the meal we had used bread to soak up the sauce - guess I'll be making the full amount next time we make this!  It was excellent!","1649127366","6"
"110591618","Karen in Denver","Delicious! Added preserved lemon but otherwise followed directions. Even my 14-year-old loved it. No need for pasta; toasted bread works great.","1607914499","5"
"128654311","Maryann","We love this and I've made twice. I cook the leeks much longer than recommended as that's how I like them. I drain beans but don't rinse them which thickens the sauce nicely. Also add a tablespoon of top quality olive oil at the end. I too could eat it all in one sitting. Just a salad and crusty bread is all it needs.","1698077466","5"
"116605799","Margie D","made this tonight and only added kale bc I had to get rid of it and was looking for a one pot meal. I used the one can of beans and with the kale it provided a good stew to dip some warm bread in. I also happened to have seafood stock on hand so I used that. Very good and the more I make this the faster it will get…nice to have in the repertoire!","1643329802","4"
"116628158","Tracy","This is wonderful. I had some Trader Joe’s already marinated garlicky shrimp in the freezer so I skipped the marinating ingredients and it was still completely delicious and even that much easier. Knew I wanted more juice so added double the broth and double the beans and then threw in some torn up kale a couple minutes before I re-added the shrimp. Delightful.","1643458849","4"
"128448777","Kat","Really love this recipe. I’ve been making it weekly since I first tried it a couple months ago. Following others’ advice, I use two cans of beans instead of one. And I use all the zest and juice of the largest lemon I find. Really an exceptional symphony of flavors and textures.","1697285968","4"
"128656347","Sandy","Love this recipe and have made it many times.  Definitely works just as well with onions if you don't have leeks.  I also use much less butter but do add a little olive oil.  And because everything is better with cheese, I add grated Parm before serving.","1698081041","4"
"131414120","john","I made this once before as written and tonight with the recommended substitution of cod in place of the shrimp. Made with shrimp it was bright, rich, and had a nice combination of textures. Made with cod it was under-seasoned and the texture of cod and beans made it kind of boring.  Lesson: Use shrimp. If you've got cod, find another recipe.","1708908434","4"
"115122998","Alicia","Perfect. This is one of those recipes that’s truly greater than the sum of its parts, and it comes together shockingly quickly. I wanted to add white wine as some have suggested but didn’t have any. I did find the broth needed a tiny bit of sweetness so I added a pinch of sugar. The result was great but I think white wine would have served this purpose and more. I also halved the shrimp since it was just two of us but used a whole can of beans. We devoured the entire pot with French bread.","1634854560","3"
"116616209","Sandy","Made this last night with lots of onions instead of leeks, and finished it with a light coating of grated parm.   Delicious and so easy!   Could also serve without the shrimp for vegetarians.","1643387533","3"
"116633722","Chdgreene","This was fantastic. Definitely make the toast.","1643481780","3"
"116885517","CPK","i used 1 shallot and one leek because it’s what i had.  also forgot parsley so i used some dried parsley and fresh cilantro mixed w lemon juice. marinated shrimp with recommendation plus a splash of evoo and lemon juice. sautéed leek and shallot w olive oil before adding stock and beans, spinach towards the end.  and in a different pan the shrimp mixture w lemon juice mixture and white wine. combined at the end end. whole fam said 5 stars","1644712526","3"
"116930346","Michele","What a great recipe! I froze half of it and it defrosted beautifully 2 weeks later. Just as good as the day I made it. I will make again!","1644951606","3"
"118032931","Alice","Rancho Gordo flageolet beans are nice with this - I used 2 cups of cooked beans and seasoned the bean juice with a bit of chicken bouillion for the liquid. Also subbed  shallots for leeks and followed suggestion to cook shrimp separately then add. Pasta instead of bread was good. Keeper!","1651010286","3"
"118913038","H","Replaced oninon for leak and worked fine.","1655856183","3"
"128653220","Mary H","I make something very similar to this but use onions (though wil definitely try it with leeks) and add canned or frozen artichoke hearts. It is a big hit. Good with bread or over pasta. Sometimes just add orzo  and extra broth to the pot and cook before adding back the shrimp.","1698075526","3"
"116633610","Caroliina","Pureed cannellini beans and leeks, topped with diced shrimp marinated in chili oil. Delish","1643481182","2"
"131742728","Amanda","Delicious. Doubled cannellini beans. Otherwise as suggested.   Next time with shrimp I’ll use a veggie stock. Chicken was a bit overpowering for shrimp for me. But fish stock would be too fishy.   I used the chilled down  over white bean stew  (having picked out all the prawns!) as a cold  salad as  a side salad for avocado on grilled ciabatta. Delicious. I’m more likely to create the base with all the spices and lemon juice that went into the marinade and add my protein of choice on the day.","1710060697","2"
"134066972","absolutely delicious","I made this with the following modifications and it was amazing:  1. Added the lemon juice to the shrimp marinade (on accident)  2. Used 2 tbsp butter 3. Doubled the beans  4. Added some spinach at the end  5. Added more lemon juice at the end and some red pepper flakes for a spicy kick","1719015145","2"
"135110007","Beaufort ""Bo"" Hica","First time I've bought leeks in my life, so worth it.  Used wild NC shrimp we had in the freezer, and modified only to add a second can of beans, and a bag of baby spinach for color and iron content. I also just sauteed the shrimp in another pan at the end rather than par-cooking them, either would work, but I did it my way.","1722475387","2"
