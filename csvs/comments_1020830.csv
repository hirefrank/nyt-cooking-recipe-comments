"104870675","Bob Rosen","I'm surprised at the medium-high heat recommended for caramelizing the shallots. In my experience, shallots are much more sensitive to cooking temperature than onions — and are prone to burn if cooked too quickly. I'd suggest turning the heat down just as soon as the shallots have begun to sizzle a bit — otherwise they'll be burned well before they've fully caramelized.","1580256040","953"
"104857652","Allan Rivlin","You could replace anchovies with a kalamata olive tapenade and/or reconstitute some sun-dried tomatoes in water and fine chop.","1580210820","900"
"104861363","Tim","As one of the Instagram messengers who asked for this — with zero expectation —thank you times a million!   For those asking for an anchovy substitute, that’s kinda like reading a recipe for olive oil cake and then asking what can be used instead. I’d try with a smaller amount Of anchovies — even just 1 or 2 — and work your way up. Cooked like this they somehow both disappear into subtlety while exploding with savoriness. I used to think I hated anchovies, but I don’t anymore thanks to Alison.","1580225265","458"
"104891996","Bonnie Tawse","On Instagram earlier today, Alison Roman said (in so many words) this dish is all about the anchovies so do not ask about an anchovy substitute, just make a different pasta dish.","1580351049","352"
"104855671","Doug","Any suggestions for an anchovie substitute?","1580185654","347"
"104869492","CFXK","The things you learn...  Preparing this tonight.  Local market had choice of Hunts Tomato Paste and Hunts No-Salt-Added Tomato Paste. With salt from the anchovies and that used in caramelization, wanted to be careful with additional salt.  Bought both and decided I'd figure it out later.  Back home, I checked ingredients and nutritional values. Want to know the difference between the two?  The labeling!  Nothing else. Otherwise identical.  It's just marketing.  Who'd a thunk it?  Caveat emptor","1580249983","338"

"104893750","Adrienne","Serious Eats says 1 Large Shallot = 1/2 cup minced or sliced. 1 Medium Shallots = 1/4 cup minced or sliced. 1 Small Shallots = 2 tablespoons minced","1580358953","300"
"104948149","wkmtca","i want to know how anyone can cook thinly sliced garlic, over medium heat, for 15-20 minutes without them burning to a bitter mess.  no, i don't think so.  i would add them maybe 5 minutes before the end of the cooking process.  this is like recipes that say to cook onions until caramelized.. 10 -15 minutes.  in your dreams, plan 30 - 45 or more minutes for that.","1580574747","240"
"104882616","Rick","So can anybody who has had success with recipe tell me about how much in grams or ounces you need for the shallots. Large means nothing to me.  It is a shame that people who write recipes like this for mass consumption can not be more specific on the amounts of ingredients.","1580314495","194"
"104861970","MelanieSQ","ATK's taste test had King Oscar (tin) as the favorite brand, with Ortiz in the glass jar in 2nd.  Ortiz is about $13, King Oscar less than $3.","1580226771","189"
"104870387","LG","Help! Is one shallot the whole bulb or just one of the “cloves” inside?","1580254331","175"
"104873453","mods","This was insanely good. Completely addictive, just kept wanting to go back for more long after I was full. Made it exactly according to the recipe, used spaghetti. I always thought I didn’t like anchovies until I started using NYT cooking.","1580266934","167"
"104875471","Prakash Nadkarni","Anchovies are a concentrated umami source. The closest substitute is fish sauce, as Andrew points out: see Harold McGee's ""On Food and Cooking"". The Romans' fish sauce was called Garum: after it went out of fashion, anchovies replaced it - both are fermented fish products.  If you're vegan, use fermented soybean paste or miso, which are more intense than soy sauce. (Olives and capers are nice, but lack umami, which is due to savory amino acids, primarily glutamate, from a protein source.)","1580277208","162"
"104865607","Karen","Anchovies cooked taste almost nothing like anchovies out of the can. If you are worried about it, reduce the quantity. If you want to eliminate them completely, it won't taste the same. Be brave!","1580236459","154"
"104870030","Abigail","Zest of one lemon, plus the juice of 1/2 mixed into the sauce prior to pasta tossing is a nice plus!","1580252518","137"
"104884020","Susan","For the truly anchovy averse, try a tube of anchovy paste. It keeps in the fridge forever, and you can just squirt in a dab, without having to open a whole can for a small amount and the yuck factor is gone. It's basically just a tube of flavor, and is frankly delicious. Not quite the same as the real thing, but pretty darn close.","1580317666","137"
"104858802","Swati P.S.","Since I’m a vegetarian I have replaced anchovies with a mix of any or all well of pitted olives, pickled gherkins and pickled capers. A handful of Button mushrooms finely chopped adds bulk to the sauce! It turned out to be delicious!","1580217192","108"
"104868131","Max T (London UK)","Really delicious.  3 kids agreed. Plea for metric units for your European readers. Even UK cooks are mostly metric these days (tho who knows what will happen on Friday!)","1580244713","99"
"104914961","cjon","LOVE LOVE LOVE this dish! I followed the recipe almost exactly with two super minor changes:  1. caramelized the shallots over low heat (instead of medium high). 2. Cooked the bag of 16 oz pasta then combined it with the sauce (instead of reserving 1/2 for later as suggested by the recipe, which seemed a bit strange).  Will definitely be making this regularly.","1580442702","81"
"104893736","Caitlin","This recipe is a delight! It is inexpensive to make and tastes wonderful. I used a very large macaroni type of pasta and ended up using the whole contents of the shallot-paste-sauce. It was wonderful. I cried a lot when I cut up all of the shallots. Like, a lot. But if felt cathartic and it was totally worth it in the end.","1580358882","78"
"104850955","Allison","How large is a large shallot? I just bought one today, and it is almost three inches long from root to tip.","1580166408","66"

"105182814","Ana","I made this a second time and caramelised the shallots slowly, for much longer - about 40 mins. It becomes a very different (and delicious) dish, sweet and sticky and rich. Worth spending the extra time","1581535929","53"
"104908842","Dean","Cooking the shallots and garlic down for 15-20 min on medium high would have burned them.  I got them simmering and then cut the temp down to med-low and let them caramelize properly without burning.","1580415461","51"
"104949264","C, SF","I tried Umeboshi paste as a substitute for anchovies since I recently cut fish from my diet, and it was amazing!!  I had doubts, but it really was a great stand in for anchovies.  Thanks to the person in the comments who recommended it.","1580580486","48"
"104860063","Brandon","Sorry, Doug but this is an Alison Roman recipe and anchovies are her brand. No substitutes!","1580221908","43"
"104904974","Jane","Randy, hers was not an unreasonable question. Whereas regular garlic heads are very close in size, shallots are all over the map. I believe the rule of thumb is that a large shallot equals 1/2 cup. Recipes in The Washington Post generally do translate such ingredients into ounces/pounds, which is way more helpful.","1580405037","39"
"104863156","mary ann","An alternate is helpful if you are allergic to fish.","1580229689","36"
"104859163","Jessie","Because vegan? If so, try umeboshi paste.","1580218693","35"
"107022646","Maia","This recipe is fine. It’s interesting and fun to make, and it’s fine. It’s not spectacular or stunning. It’s fine! I like it. It does need lemon or olives - another commenter here recommended adding lemon zest with the tomato paste and lemon juice when you mix it with the pasta water, and that improves it A Lot. Otherwise it’s just completely fine. This isn’t the sauce to end all sauces. It’s just a fine sauce.","1589378970","33"
"104955883","Jennifer","Bob Rosen is right about lowering the medium high temperature suggested. The VERY thinly sliced shallots will likely burn if cooked for 15-20 minutes. I had to turn down the temp as he suggested, and they caramelized perfectly in about 12 minutes. Anchovies are essential to this recipe, but I could imagine kalamata tapenade as a substitute.","1580613353","31"
"104914286","brendan","This is insanely good. If you’re cooking for a group and using a pound of pasta just use all the sauce with the pasta. Recommend bucatini and add pecorino. Love the parsley and garlic with salt “salad” too.","1580438113","28"
"104926737","Cara","Added capers just before I finished the paste and it worked super well and was a big hit. Amazing recipe.","1580493630","25"
"104937272","kelsey","This is really delicious. There are so many options for additions, but the base of shallots and tomato paste is a great foundation and so easy. I added a bunch of braised kale and a few handfuls of fresh herbs (basil, parsley, oregano). Finished with some parmesan. This would be really delicious with some toasted bread crumbs, too. A+.","1580524150","24"
"104949536","Lois Harrison","Made it yesterday as written and we loved it. The prep takes a little time, but not bad. I soak the shallots in boiling water for 5 min. , allow them to cool, and remove skins. Saves a lot of tears!","1580584234","24"
"104854996","Plumberb","Haven't cooked it yet - just finished dinner - but I already know this recipe is right up my lane on the Brooklyn side (a little hook hitting between the 1 and two pins)! Anchovies in pasta are sublime - shallots, garlic and tomato paste clearly makes it even better. You can bet on what's on the menu tommorow...","1580182266","23"
"104883065","Julie","I'm one of those weirdos always delighted to find anchovies in a recipe. :) Yum! Thank you, Allison!","1580315546","21"
"105137420","sandra","Serious Eats says 1 Large Shallot = 1/2 cup minced or sliced. 1 Medium Shallots = 1/4 cup minced or sliced. 1 Small Shallots = 2 tablespoons minced. could add kale.","1581366922","21"
"105151577","Tim","I've made this amazingly flavorful dish twice already.  With the second one I didn't have quite enough shallots so added some caramelized onions.  Then I thinned it out to pizza-sauce consistency with a bit of vegetable broth, spread it on Neapolitan style 48-hour proofed homemade pizza dough and topped that with bits of fresh mozzarella and black oil-cured olives.  Baked at 550 for six minutes. Excellent! Guests loved it, as did I.","1581443686","21"
"105713755","Javed","If you want to make this without anchovies, I would suggest that you find a different pasta dish to make. There is no substitute for the flavour, and this dish is not the same without it. Forget any nonsense about tapenade, forget about umeboshi paste. None of those things are the same and changes the fundamentals on the dish.","1583793848","21"
"104937378","Gary","This was simply delicious!  As some others did, I used a full pound of pasta (bucatini) with the full recipe of sauce.  The flavors were extraordinary, quite unlike any pasta dish that I have ever had.  I love anchovies, but in this dish I could not taste them at all.  But they do add a certain umami that adds to the depth of flavor of the sauce.  I’ll definitely be making this again!","1580524516","18"
"105540740","Bobbie R.","As an inexperienced cook/foodie who’s never had an anchovy, I thought that this pasta dish was a little bit strange, but solidly good. I went back for a second helping, as did my boyfriend who remarked that it reminded him of Chinese food (huh?). But just now for a light lunch I decided to have some toast with the leftover shallot jam and a fried egg on top, and oh my GOD. It was so delicious!! This leftover paste is going to change my life. Probably a permanent staple in my fridge now.","1583091407","18"
"104913989","Eric","Please don't be afraid of anchovies. Cooking with them, you really do not taste them as you would on top of a pizza... they just add complexity and character. If you rinse them, they are much less salty for those who watch...","1580436167","17"
"108004027","Linsey","I have to be honest—I didn’t care for this (apparently I’m the only one). I followed the recipe precisely and the end product looked delicious. I even used fresh pasta! However I just didn’t like the flavors. I don’t think this is a bad recipe, it just wasn’t for me.","1594164520","17"
"104862684","mae","Yes, I always throw in the whole jar, oil & all to all recipes. Never a problem!","1580228516","16"
"106132734","Hima","Such a great recipe - it does take a while to slice all the shallots but it’s so worth it for a weeknight dinner.   Modifications:  * My family doesn’t eat anchovies so I used just over a tbsp of Korean fermented soybean paste for the umami and it came out AMAZING.  * Tripled the red pepper flakes  * added a bunch of chopped kale for veggies","1585539201","15"
"105715324","EM","Great recipe. Some suggested edits:  - As others said, cook shallots on low otherwise they will burn before getting a deep rich caramelization - I felt it needed something acidic to brighten up the dish.  Adding some capers with the brine to the shallots right before adding the pasta did the trick","1583799024","14"
"110694666","Lori Agee","This was just awful.  For so many reasons.  The shallots disappeared in the thick sauce.  The quantity of anchovies was proportionally too great (and I love anchovies).  The red pepper flakes did not add enough heat.  The oil from the anchovies made the whole thing too oily.  The tomato paste - even after cooking - still tasted like tomato paste.  People must not know what a good pasta sauce is if they think this is one of the best of the year.  Blech.","1608488865","14"
"104887117","Jack Donnelly","If you really can't bring yourself to use anchovies (or don't have any in the pantry), olives in some form are the obvious choice.  But how about some good balsamic vinegar?  (It goes well with all both shallots and tomato.)  Or to go with a completely different (but still complementary) flavor profile, mushrooms?  Tempeh?  A little bit of sopressata cut in tiny cubes?  A big handful of basil?  Sage?  Think about different ways to complement and work off the shallots.","1580326825","12"
"104915328","Pete Roddy","Worchester sauce contains anchovies.","1580445752","12"
"104932288","phalgal","I made this last night and was very disappointed. The tomato paste totally overwhelmed the shallot ""jam"" and it all just tasted tinny. I'm going to try it again but reduce the tomato paste to a tablespoon, or maybe leave out altogether.","1580506225","12"
"104936622","kat","Looks like bucatini! I just went to the store to get some but instead found perciatelli, which I had never seen before. Same tubular form but a little thinner - so that could work too!","1580521118","12"
"105944286","Aurora","Agreed that the medium high heat is too high. Recommend medium low and cooking longer. Also make sure the heat isn't too high when you add the tomato paste. It may take longer to caramelize and turn brick red, but keep it on medium low so it doesn't scorch.","1584730337","12"
"106387523","RC","I used onions instead of shallots because that's all I had and it still works. So tasty!","1586520762","12"
"107221682","Betty","meh. this was fine, but I found the taste of the shallots to be overwhelmed by the tomato paste, and the anchovies were very subtle. If I make this again, I'd use 50% more shallots. I do like that it uses a whole can of tomato paste - and it keeps very well in the fridge and freezer and is a versatile thing to add to other foods where you might be adding tomato paste. but probably would not go through the effort to make a slightly dressed up tomato paste during non pandemic lockdown times.","1590425558","12"
"104915204","B","Honeymooned recently in Italy and was told during a cooking class that Bucatini and perciatelli are the same pasta by different names, dependent on region.","1580444693","11"
"105488776","Terri","All of you folks asking for a substitute for anchovies, stop. Just stop.  This recipe is perfection {chef's kiss}","1582849696","11"
"104858000","David H.","Doug-anchovy substitute.  maybe fermented tofu?  or how about marmite?  maybe soy marinated shiitake mushrooms?","1580213259","9"
"104860242","Tim","Re: Anne's request for anchovy fillet options... there is a brand (I don't have its name, sorry) from Italy that is distinctive because it comes in a small mason-type jar with a rubber ring seal and wire closure. The anchovies are standing upright, so to speak.  I've purchased it from Costco and it s/b available at good gourmet-style groceries.","1580222341","9"
"106441196","Kuo Kooks","I made this recipe as is. No substitutions. It was absolutely delicious as written. My only suggestion is to turn one the heat a bit when caramelizing shallots so that they don’t burn. I’m an advanced cook so was able to correct this pretty early on. I also would suggest adding a bit of pasta water to half the sauce to help it spread better. I found it a bit dry to spread on the pasta.","1586800628","9"
"106708661","Ali","It was divine. First bite was good and by the third bite you want to rub it all over yourself. Used fusilli and all the sauce. Just before eating, add a bit of lemon juice and fresh parm. We don’t love anchovies - loved, loved this. It’s like when you go to a great restaurant and wonder how in the world their pasta dish is so terrific and yours always tastes like Chef-BoyarDee. Just make it.","1587880081","9"
"104957298","BM","Made the pasta and it was great.  Don’t change a thing.  People-eat your anchovies!  There is no vegetarian substitute. Used the leftover sauce on a cheeseless pizza with capers and olives. It was gobbled up in seconds. Great recipe. Thanks","1580621829","8"
"105246434","Liz S.","I've just made this a second time and made these slight changes: 1) I used half the anchovies BUT began with half EEVO and half anchovy oil. Was still very tasty but a little less fishy. 2) I toasted some homemade breadcrumbs and added to the garlic clove and parsley at end. This gave a nice texture to the dish that it initially lacked. I also added a bit of Locatelli Romano at the table. Took a great recipe to my husband's new favorite.","1581774971","8"
"106553061","rose","How long does leftover paste last?","1587217175","8"
"111352810","Lynn","Why isn’t this recipe edited to reduce the heat when caramelizing the shallots? That is a very necessary modification to the recipe. The mix also needs more cooking time than two minutes after adding the tomato paste - no wonder people complain. Experienced cooks will know to make these modifications, but for those who follow the recipe exactly, this recipe needs better guidance.","1612122356","8"
"104893872","ftho64","Very tasty and worth making. I will make this again for sure.  My note is that frying shallots for 15 minutes on medium high would’ve completely carbonized them on my stove. I turned it down to medium and had to add water to prevent scorching, and that took more like 7 minutes. Next time I will be frying at a lower temp.   Also I used the whole batch of shallot paste with a full pound of pasta and it came out fine.","1580359670","7"
"104913608","Bambi","This recipe is amazing and probably the reason the spring street Trader Joe’s is out of shallots","1580434292","7"
"108385473","Emily","I've made this recipe about a dozen times now.  There has never been much error among all of the trials, but here are a couple of lessons learned: low and slow is best when caramelizing the shallots; do not get hung up on ""is this considered a large or small shallot?"" because an extra shallot or two is perfectly fine (and delicious); do not skip the fresh parsley & garlic mixture on top; and finally, a soft boiled egg right under that garnish of parsley & garlic is a truly heavenly addition.","1596053863","7"
"109490811","Jane","I wanted to love this based on the hype, but it was virtually inedible. Despite halving what the recipe called for it was overwhelmingly fishy. Perhaps I used the wrong type/brand of anchovy? We don’t have picky eaters in this house but ended up just making buttered noodles after tasting the finished sauce. A lot of work for a big disappointment.","1601960538","7"
"111354298","Nathalie","This recipe worked as written but it was only fine. Possibly even ""meh."" It tasted mostly of the tins the ingredients came in and required an aggressive hand with seasoning at the end to make up for its one-dimensionality. There was no pleasure—no brightness—in this sauce. It was flat and dull. I used high-quality Italian tomato paste (DOP-certified, even) and nice anchovies and I felt like I wasted them. I love all of these ingredients, I went to culinary school; I did not mess up the recipe.","1612136863","7"
"104861373","JG","You could always replace anchovies with olives of your choice for that same briny flavor and texture. Kalamata would probably work best.","1580225297","6"
"104892065","Ellen","We loved this pasta!  I added grilled Asparagus cut to the size of the Penne pasta I used.  Also added small mozzarella balls that melted into the dish so wonderfully and made it even more delish.  We will be having this again with other in season veggies.","1580351357","6"
"106548812","A.J.G.","This is incredible - the second time I made it I had a tragic accident with my anchovies (literally dropped them down the drain), and it was honestly still really good. So if you’re veg / don’t like chovies, I would just go ahead and omit. The sauce is still delicious!","1587169479","6"
"106668240","Stacy","There’s a lot of reviews already but I needed to comment. I almost scrapped this halfway through. I feared I had gone beyond carmelized to burnt and told my husband I was going to toss it. Cooler heads prevailed and it was every bit as delicious as I’d hoped. Don’t skip the parsley mixture either, it really added a nice dimension to the sweet and heat.","1587694958","6"
"108137790","Hannah","Don’t totally get the hype. The kick from the red pepper flakes comes through much more strongly than any caramelized shallot flavor. Next time might cut down on the red pepper slightly and add capers. Did try topping with a spritz of lemon which did brighten it up.","1594787008","6"
"109903329","Jennifer W","Just make this dish - whether you like anchovies or not, just make the recipe as directed - it is...perfection. I am not an anchovy fan typically but trusted the recipe as it states they melt - that is 100% accurate. You are left with this rich tasting tomato sauce with garlic and a touch of heat. This is an entertainment worthy dish and really shows you how a few quality ingredients can really shine. We did add a light sprinkle of Parmesan on top of the garlic parsley mixture - delicious!!!","1604155114","6"
"110719454","Andy","Meh.  I don't know what all the hype is about.  I cooked the recipe as written with no changes.  I was hoping for something greater than the sum of its parts, but didn't get that here.  The delicious flavor of caramelized shallots was completely overwhelmed by anchovies.  This is a decent recipe if these ingredients are all you have in your pantry, but I wouldn't make a special trip to the grocery store just to make this.","1608647691","6"
"105218593","Doh Feher","Awesome recipe! I subbed onion for shallots, added capers and olives, splash of vinegar, less anchovy, and canned tomatoes instead of paste. Kept the parsley at the end. It turned out great :)","1581641896","5"
"107083140","David","Tried it with onions too and it is just as good.","1589644397","5"
"111308409","Tiffany Huang","I have made this twice, following the recipe and accompanying video closely. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, but the shallots are not standing out for me. It tastes like tomato sauce with a briny base from the anchovies - if I didn't know there were shallots in it, I wouldn't realize. I was expecting a more shallot-forward flavor, but I'm not getting it. Are you guys who are getting more shallot flavor adding less tomato paste, caramelizing longer, etc?","1611851340","5"
"111413117","brianne","I followed the recipe to a T. Found bucatini in this bucatini shortage, sourced anchovies from sahadis, gathered shallots from Whole Foods and was so ready to be blown away. I am so disappointed by this dish. It is inedible.. way too fishy and anchovy forward. Also why would a recipe make you make a double batch of sauce?? Just wasted all these ingredients.","1612397362","5"
"115870511","Penny","With the leftover paste, I made the most delicious dish ever! Take about 3 servings worth paste, saute in a tsp of oil until reheated, add two diced potatoes, add 1 tbsp garam masala (can sub curry powder), add 2 cups of basmati rice, salt to taste, 3 cups of water, a small handful of chopped fresh mint leaves (THIS IS KEY). Bring to a boil, then lower and simmer for 10-15 minutes until the rice is cooked, then turn off the heat, rest for 10 min, fluff with a fork and ENJOY!","1639177271","5"
"120948370","Aliana","I made an addition that I feel really elevates this from a bit stodgy to something fresh… Oven roasted cherry tomatoes! Slice cherry tomatoes in half, toss with olive oil and bit of salt. Roast at 375-400 for about 20 minutes. Add it to the sauce after adding the tomato paste. The sweetness and texture of the roasted cherry tomatoes adds a whole new dimension to the dish!","1665884921","5"

"106546908","Jenn Amy Lee","If you have dried anchovies, you can grind it into powder which will help with blending the flavors into the dish. Anchovies do not have a strong fishy taste and are a great addition to this dish.   But if you're looking for a substitute, you can use kombu (dried kelp) sold in Asian grocery stores. Anchovies and kombu are typically used for creating the base for numerous Asian dishes. Just break off a small piece and cook out the flavor. Take out the kelp after you're done cooking.","1587161293","4"
"106843602","Ashley","I have made this several times as the recipe dictates and it is delicious (of course, it's Alison Roman). The last several times I have added some marinara sauce either at the end or to the jar of leftover concentrate to make it last a little longer and/or to make it saucier. I have also used the leftover sauce in recipes calling for tomato paste (like the Bon Appetit recipe for carmelized cabbage) and it makes everything better.","1588539154","4"
"106906070","Jana from South Dakota","WOW! Used the exact ingredients, and we are overwhelmed with the complex flavor. Perfect pantry meal for a pandemic. Only change I made was caramelizing the shallots and garlic at the beginning at a lower heat, for a little longer time.","1588808156","4"

"109507698","Lanam","Delicious. I didn’t have a Dutch oven so I used a heavy nonstick pot. Kept the flame on medium until the shallots sizzled, then medium low. Sliced garlic thick so it wouldn’t burn. Used a generous amount of olive oil so the shallots fried. Used fettuccine - would use spaghetti next time. Used 6 Oz can of tomato paste - would recommend 4.5 oz next time. Used 2 cups pasta water to thin out the tomato paste - may not need that much if you use 4.5 oz. MUST make the parsley/garlic/salt mix - so good.","1602036114","4"

"111568861","Hannah","This recipe is great, but as a person who really isn't into fish, I have to caution likeminded folks that the anchovy was very prominent for me, despite other commenters apparently not tasting it much. I was kinda bummed by how fishy it ended up being for me. Otherwise delicious, though, so it'll be worth it for me to try it out again using miso instead.   Even better with a drizzle of lemon juice before serving.","1613258257","4"
"112498340","LR","I've made it with anchovies, and it is delicious! Also made it with my girlfriend, who does not like anchovies, so we took the advice of another comment and used miso paste. Not quite the same, but still very good if you're looking for a substitute.","1618888277","4"

I enjoy the way I feel myself learning this recipe better that I’m not even looking at it so much to make it. It’s becoming second nature to me and I’m enjoying cooking it a lot. I’m working on streamlining it so the shallots and pasta are ready at the same time. I’m getting better at it but it’s a work in progress.","1623557266","4"
"115962970","Jason","I found this to be a pretty underwhelming dish.  Weirdly my 2 year old daughter loved it, but the rest of us felt it was just a little boring.  It was by no means difficult, but I wouldn’t say it was worth the effort.  Maybe I’ll give it another shot, but it wasn’t as interesting or, to be honest, as flavorful as I’d hoped.  Teetered on bland, and that’s unexpected given how “big” the ingredients are.","1639739352","4"

"116522375","Jeanne","I made this exactly as written (didn't even substitute for the anchovies, of which I'm not a fan) and was, frankly, surprised by how *meh* it was.  Perhaps my six shallots, which I considered large, weren't large enough?  (Here's where an estimate of the amount, either in cups or grams, would be helpful).  I found it really bland and uninteresting, and the five star rating really has me wondering what I did wrong.","1642937473","4"
"116606927","Marianne","Some of us are allergic to anchovies! It’s not an aversion for everyone. Sometimes it’s trying to recapture the flavor of something that sounds amazing without having an anaphylactic reaction. So, that being said this recipe is amazing even just skipping them but benefits from some mushroom paste which I offended use to substitute for anchovies since I can’t have sea vegetables either which eliminates a lot of Miso pastes. Just in case that’s helpful for anyone else with an iodine allergy. ☺️","1643334808","4"

"117240038","Charles Michener","I made this  as written and it was inedible. Shallots cooked on medium-high for 20 minutes don't just caramelize, they burn and taste acrid. A whole can of anchovies doesn't stay in the background, it becomes the foreground.  A whole 6 oz can of tomato paste is asking for heartburn. Adding flaky salt (on top of the anchovies) is asking for a stroke. Do the shallots at low heat and cut all the other ingredients by at least half and you'll have a reasonable sauce and live longer.","1646535151","4"
"104940041","Z","I was very cautious with my salt to make sure I wasn’t overdoing it given the anchovies and also deglazed the pan using a splash of the red wine I was drinking.  I used fresh pasta but for once I wish I used boxed in this case to have a bit more of an al dente texture. I finished it off by serving in the pot and drizzling with really good olive oil.","1580532422","3"
"104964439","Lexy","This was so freaking delicious I am already planning on how to use the leftover shallot jam for my very next dinner. My advice is use more shallots than recommended so that you have tons of leftovers to play with. Do not skimp on the anchovies either, they melt into the other ingredients with no fishy taste just beautiful umami flavor. I followed the recipe almost religiously except that I added more olive oil if I thought the shallots were cooking to quick on medium high heat.","1580662285","3"
"105184881","Tim","I'm no expert but probably longer than you think (e.g. two weeks or more) because it (a) starts out with no bacteria due to cooking; (b) contains a lot of sugar and salt which are preservatives and (c) contains a lot of capsicum from red peppers which provides antimicrobial properties.  In any case this is a great question and worthy of expert discussion in many kitchen/culinary cases.","1581541318","3"

"106447220","existingshallot","Did Alison Roman predict that we would all be stuck inside our homes with a lot of pasta and craving flavor?! It seems that way. This was the perfect meal. I finally found parsley and have been buying a shallot or two every time I saw them so I could eventually make this pasta. I found all the cooking times to be spot-on and even with layering salt and pepper I still could have used more salt at the end which is why the parsley, flake salt and garlic make so much sense.  Can’t wait to make again","1586816450","3"

"110461439","CBR","Really delicious.  I don’t usually follow recipes to the absolute letter, but came pretty close with this one. I loved it. The jammy texture and hint of sweetness strangely reminded me of pad Thai even though the flavors are very different. Next time I’ll add a bit more crushed red pepper.  If you, like me, question at the outset whether a full quarter cup of olive oil is necessary, I think it is.","1607175986","3"

Also really, really good with baked spaghetti squash.","1607789709","3"

I followed this letter to a T, and it’s just not good. If you like anchovies, it probably is, but the smell and flavor is really overpowering. I wish I’d read more than the “most helpful” reviews before I made it. I am dumbfounded this recipe has a five-star rating.   Tip: if you’re not sure you like the flavor profile of anchovies, steer clear of this recipe.","1612661935","3"

"114732124","Julia","You don't need to know how many grams a large shallot is. This isn't baking or rocket science. Just slice up some shallots and no matter the quantity it will still be delicious.  Also, not every recipe is nor should be for everyone. Why people insist on making a dish with ingredients they don't like or don't eat is beyond me. Don't like anchovies? Then you can leave them out. But that's not the dish. You can sub olives for capers in a piccata. Will still be great. But again, not the dish.","1632793446","3"
"115813180","Penny","Wow! This is one of the best pasta dishes I've ever cooked! I am a vegetarian, so I substituted the anchovies with about 8 olives finely chopped.

"117391147","Molly","I didn’t like this the night I made it. I followed instructions to a T, but the anchovies were overpowering the whole dish. However, I had already made it, so I begrudgingly took it for lunch the next… amazing! Totally mellowed out and I loved every bite.","1647394673","3"

"106828270","Chloe","We loved this dish; it’s flavorful and indulgent, and pretty easy. We will make it again for sure.   I could certainly taste the anchovies, in a good way, (we use cheap Cento ones) and the dish reminded me a bit of Italian Pad Thai because of the tangy tomato and fishy umami.   Very annoying the recipe is written for 10 oz of pasta. We made it as written but held back none of the shallot mixture and put it on 16 oz pasta.","1588431924","2"

I love anchovies and onion already, but I wasn't sure how the group I was cooking for would like it. However, all of them went bonkers! We loved it, it tastes warm and comforting but not too heavy, especially with a salad! I only had spaghetti noodles but I can't wait to make it again!

I use the whole small can of tomato paste and add the garlic after the shallots are carmelized, so it doesn’t burn. And I use a pound of pasta and all the sauce. Don’t skip the pasta water step, it gives the sauce a velvety texture.   I don’t think it tastes fishy (I use Cento anchovies and drain the oil), but miso paste might be a good umami substitute.","1614560592","2"

It seemed like a lot in the beginning but it reduced quite a bit in the caramelization process and turned out perfectly.","1615676793","2"
"112238736","TrufflesNYC","This dish was a huge hit! So much so I made it twice within 4 days by request. I couldn’t find anchovies that weren’t in hot pepper so I used anchovy paste (1 Tbs) and it was great. The other change...I used all of the sauce for my 10oz. of pasta.

Here’s my lil cost breakdown bc i couldn’t resist : $2.50 pappardelle pasta $1.25 shallots  $1.5 anchovies $0.50 fresh parsley  $1 spanish olive oil  $1 tomato paste $0.25 garlic  that’s 8 delicious dollars right there. go make it.","1675231873","2"
