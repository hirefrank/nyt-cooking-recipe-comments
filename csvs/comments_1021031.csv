"106774093","Ned","As I've mentioned in previous NYT Lasagna recipes, a great hack for the lasagna pasta is simply placing the noodles in a large deep tray and pouring hot tap water over them.  Leave them immersed for ten minutes, every so often re-distributing them from top to bottom.  The result is perfectly pliable, undamaged noodles, ready for assembly in your lasagna pan, or the same tray you used for the hot tap water bath.  A great hack.","1588180036","636"
"106780937","Kat","Heyyyy... where it says ""1 recipe Homemade Lasagna Sheets, 16 fresh store-bought lasagna sheets, 2 (9-ounce) packages dried lasagna noodles (preferably without curly edges) or no-boil noodles (boiled until al dente)"" does the instruction to boil the noodles apply to ""no-boil"" noodles? Is that a stupid question? I want to make this in the most lazy way possible, please","1588203319","383"
"106762364","Lee","This is the best lasagna I've ever tasted! Took a while but sooo worth it. I cut the recipe in half and used an 8x8 inch pan which fit perfectly. Folding up the edges, bottom over the top is brilliant and held it all together like a pie. Thanks Samin!","1588125794","132"
"106805211","Andrew","Tasty but took a long time to make. Would go a tad lighter on the pasta next time (not as many layers).  This beast was so heavy that I weighed the finished product...15 pounds...  So, yet another bonus is that you can use it to do squats for a workout if you’re concerned about calorie intake :) Thanks for the recipe!","1588312897","100"
"106737120","Kate","This is almost exactly my lasagna recipe, which I spent years creating and perfecting! Samin Nosrat is a culinary genius, and authentically humble! So excited about this recipe!!","1588025751","96"
"106906939","MexicoCooks","I made this lasagna yesterday (5/5/2020).  It was superb.  Four adults ate about half of it--merciful heavens, we all loved it.  In addition to the ease of the step-by-step, the Very. Best. Tip. in the recipe was the parchment paper to cover the top, before wrapping the whole thing in aluminum foil.  Major lightbulb time!  The parchment paper leaves the cheesy top of the lasagna intact, not ripping it from the next layer as aluminum foil would.  Thank you Samin Nosrat!","1588812381","85"
"106801767","davidL","If you are using fresh pasta sheets why mess around with boiling water? The pasta will cook in the  tomato sauce. I have never had a problem with this","1588289505","84"
"106830928","Rupal","Samin's most important note:make sure each component tastes delicious. Made several changes but kept to that mantra. Loved result. +halved the recipe - used 3 layers of fresh pasta. Baked for half the time. +cooked spinach with onions and garlic and added a good bit of Sicilian oregano to boost flavor profile then pureed and added ricotta +Marcella Hazan's tomato and butter sauce (!) stewed with one onion cut in half then removed +1tsp fennel seed +cayenne. Quick soak pasta in hot water next tim","1588451310","68"
"106744957","Dawn","I love the specialness of this event & recipe. I love how she describes the anticipation of an Event/ a true Meeting/ a Happening — a Communion, really. In the effort of preparing each component of the dish, she offers us the opportunity of holding space for Possibility— maybe we could meet each other at the “Table” in a new way, with joy and a sense of Feasting after what has felt like a month of fasting, from others, from pleasure, from ease, from joy. We’ve worked hard, for ea other, really,","1588077146","58"
"106738694","Krysten Chambrot, Senior Staff Editor, NYT Cooking","Hey, Lou! That's right: 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning will replace the fresh herbs. Enjoy!","1588032755","55"
"106847937","Elizabeth","I’m from an Italian family so my comments probably stem from liking family recipes better. We did not like the simple tomato sauce. While the onions cook down, they leave an underlying flavor that we found unpleasant. The béchamel is a lot of work and calories without much extra flavor. Overall, with all the cheese and dairy, I expected this to taste more indulgent than it did. Homemade noodles turned out well and I liked the ricotta mix. Overall, 5 hours of work and kind of disappointing.","1588559870","45"
"106753680","Sara","I made a big tray of lasagna last week and shared it with our neighbors.  Time consuming but hey, I’ve got the time! A couple of thoughts to swap out  ingredients: - I sliced zucchini length wise, and roasted with olive oil and oregano and layered on top of the ricotta; used low fat ricotta with 2 eggs beaten in, salt, pepper and nutmeg; no bechamel - used basic dry lasagna noodles boiled 5 minutes in batches of 5; made one pan with tomato sausage sauce and one with sautéed mushrooms. Enjoy!","1588096547","44"
"107051325","julie","Made this recipe using no-boil noodles (the sheet style) and I did not boil them prior to assembly. It still turned out great!","1589487650","42"
"106752510","Laura H.","Can I use the fresh pasta sheets without boiling first? What modifications would be recommended? Thanks! Can’t wait to make this with all of you!","1588093587","37"
"106758587","Sarah","Can’t wait to make this! If I halved the ingredients, think it would work in an 8x8? I live alone and am worried I would eat all 12 servings in 24 hours!","1588110362","37"
"116081300","Jamie","Sigh. This is the best lasagna I've ever tasted, but it was such a HUGE pain in the neck to make that I'll save it only for the most special occasions.  Before I started, I wish I had 1) watched the video, 2) read the directions all the way through (rookie mistake), and 3) realized that the assembly directions were written for people lucky enough to be using fresh sheets of pasta. I'm thinking maybe making this is like childbirth-- once I forget the trauma of it, I'll want to make another one","1640553859","35"
"106737917","Marylouise","This recipe is very similar to a Spinach Lasagne recipe in the cookbook ""Greens"" by Deborah Madison (was published a looong time ago!) What Samin has done is increase the amount of bechamel (which is a good thing, I think the Greens recipe doesn't have enough) and more tomato sauce. At any rate, it's a delicious lasagna.","1588029099","28"
"106770556","Scott Citron","I made this yesterday. Here are a few comments. Working in a 9 x 13"" pan, I used nearly two 1-lb boxes of lasagna noodles. I ended using all the bechamel sauce, all the tomato sauce, and about 3/4's of the ricotta mixture. The result was delicious, but a bit too dry. Needs more tomato sauce in my opinion. Otherwise, a great, albeit time-consuming, recipe for anyone willing to make the effort.","1588171917","25"
"110783713","Frances","Good lasagna--big and heavy and tasty. I cut the recipe in half. Since there are so many steps to it I admit I didn't read it all the way through. It would be helpful if, first, the oven temperature is noted up top so it's not a scavenger hunt to find it. And second, this note, found in step 15, came too late--""If using store-bought or dried pasta, you can skip the noodle layer between the ricotta and tomato sauce as needed to prevent the lasagna from stretching higher than the top of the pan.""","1609128541","22"
"106840417","Yankee 13","A bit bland for the richness of the dish. Lacking in acidity to balance the dish, I thought. Suggest adding hot pepper flakes, perhaps hot Italian sausage, perhaps a bit more tomato sauce or a sauce with more punch..","1588520740","21"
"110473329","Lori K","I made this today.  I have to say that this is indeed the best lasagna I ever made.  I cut the recipe in half & used an 8x11 pan. The lasagna only had four layers but it was enough.  I used imported dry lasagna noodles and frozen chopped spinach.  I added an egg to the ricotta mixture because it seemed very dry.  I used more sauce than suggested because we like it saucy. I think the secret ingredient is the bechemal. The end result was a rich, juicy, cheesy lasagna.   This recipe is a keeper!!!","1607234098","20"
"106737643","Lou","One teaspoon of Italian seasoning replaces the list of fresh herbs? (It's very hard to find that much basil in rural, Northern Michigan this time of year and likely pricey too.)","1588027892","15"
"106776674","Brittany","At the end, it says it may be refrigerated after cooking for 4 days. If you're going to assemble it but not bake it, I would assemble it on Mother's Day Eve (after dinner) to go in the oven the following day for lunch. If you're going to make it ahead of time the no-boil noodles should do well since they'll have extra time to soak up liquid.","1588187921","10"
"106773843","Margaret","Thank you for this fantastic recipe from a fellow cook in Iowa. By using bechamel sauce and greens this is both practical and delicious. I am planning to grow greens in my garden this summer and this recipe will be one of our favorite ways to eat them! Enjoy reading your cooking articles—so fun! :)","1588179387","9"
"107097529","Anne","This was amazing! Worth the effort. I loved the parchment paper cover below the foil - perfect to preserve the bechamel sauce and cheese. I used no boil noodles and the suggestion of another reader softening the pasta on my cookie sheet adding boiling water for 10 minutes or so. Also used a jar of Raos' marinara instead of making my own. Added the nutmeg which was delicious. My pan while 13 X 9 is not deep enough, had to order a deeper pan to experience all the pasta layers for next time. Superb","1589759237","9"
"110783731","Frances","I agree--the temperature is hidden in there. Reading is fundamental, but this is a recipe...not a scavenger hunt! Temp should be listed at the top or side, like most recipes.","1609128710","8"
"106784586","jessica","First, I would encourage people planning to make this recipe to READ THE INSTRUCTIONS multiple times, especially if you're making your own noodles.  There are many steps!  I made it last night and the only things I did differently were to use wild ramps in place of the spinach and herbs (we already did our weekly shopping) and I ended up using 48 oz of sauce.  This lasagna was really good, but it was (I thought) very labor intensive, while not as mind blowing as I was expecting.","1588246771","6"
"110686509","Bridget Connors","You're too far down in the recipe. Step 6 says:. Prepare the lasagna: Position the highest rack in the oven so that it sits about 6 inches below the top. Heat oven to 400 degrees.  Remember, reading is fundimental!","1608420630","6"
"106852393","John Taylor","Made this in accordance with the recipe.  A lot of work but a wonderful result.  I'll find a deeper baking dish next time.  The family all loved it.","1588596735","5"
"120326849","edh","Does anyone know if this can be made a day ahead and then baked the next day?","1662739541","5"

"119010161","kallan","I was able to stretch this into two pans of lasagna with 5 layers of noodles each (two boxes of oven-ready noodles). There was no way I could fit all the layers into one disposable lasagna pan (which is slightly smaller than 9x13).  Bechamel 1. Pasta Ricotta 2. Pasta Tomato Sauce 3. Pasta Bechamel Parmesan 4. Pasta Ricotta Tomato Sauce 5. Pasta Bechamel Mozzarella","1656356988","4"
"106961111","Nancy Gold","Years ago my husband and I went into a little recommended restaurant for lunch in Pisa. We were going to order something (can't remember what), but then we noticed that *every single person* who came in to eat there or take out was ordering the lasagna, so of course we ordered it too. It was by far the best lasagna either of us had ever had. I tried to ask what was in it that made it so good, but I spoke no Italian and the chef spoke no English.  The one word I understood was, ""Besciamella.""","1589052898","3"
"115790426","Hayden","Excellent recipe. Everyone loved the delicate flavors and textures. Definitely would be best with a deeper pan - I had to skimp on pasta layers.","1638808492","3"
"118873114","Micah","This recipe was a hit! I made every component according to the recipe and the end result was delicious. I highly recommend making the fresh pasta - the noodles are so much better than store-bought. I do recommend getting a head start the day before by making the tomato sauce, ricotta mixture and béchamel. Taste and season each component as suggested. I added a few more fresh herbs from the garden, including oregano to the tomato sauce and basil, Italian parsley and thyme to the ricotta mixture.","1655556673","3"
"119392204","Aaron Lawson","This is an interesting combination of southern style (""Neapolitan"") lasagna and northern style (""Bolognese"") style. It has the besciamella of the north and the ricotta filling of the south. I make something very similar but with mozzarella instead of besciamella, which is how it's usually done in Campania. I made this as a vegetarian alternative for a dinner party a few years ago and it was a huge hit. I had two meat eaters arguing over who got to take the left-overs!","1658244261","3"
"122205705","Ailin","I never leave reviews because who cares about my opinion, but you do today.  this is the best lasagna I've ever had. I think the people who are saying it doesn't have flavor are doing two things wrong. First, use fresh spinach. I know the recipe says you can use frozen but it doesn't have the same flavor. Use fresh and salt that bbb.  Second, salt as you go. The béchamel especially needs to be salted every  layer. The ricotta could use a dash of salt for each layer to.","1672021495","3"
"111748400","Cindy O","I combined some of the layers, even using a lasagna pan with high sides, as using dry noodles.  Combined ricotta and marinara layers, eliminated final Bechamel layered in pasta, and just placed the remaining Bechamel on top (as instructed).  I made the ricotta mixture, Bechamel, and marinara the day before.  I would not recommend making the Bechamel in advance. Trying to bring it back to a workable consistency was very difficult.  Great lasagna but definitely would half the recipe next time.","1614273884","2"
"115605351","Chelsea","THE best Lasagna recipe! The youtube video is super helpful if you've never made it before <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLma4QPNSyg"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLma4QPNSyg</a> . Always make the full recipe and freeze or give away half if you can't eat it all. I  also suggest doubling the Simple Tomato Sauce and keeping half for pizza or pasta latter.","1637595355","2"
