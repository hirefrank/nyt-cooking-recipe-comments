"107624988","Mary Alford","This is a riff on an old fashioned recipe called “Essies Cobbler”.  I recommend melting the butter in the pan while the oven is preheating (leaving a bit in the pan and putting the batter in the hot pan create a lovely chewy crust) and also increasing the amount of fruit which can be any juicy fruit - peaches, blueberries, etc.","1592310643","1595"
"107621021","annsch","This was a delicious easy dessert. I chopped 1 up of fresh rhubarb and simmered it with the 1/3 c. Brown sugar, when it was softened I added the strawberries.  We are huge strawberry rhubarb fans, this might be better than our family pie recipe!","1592274557","374"
"107646503","Faded elegance","I browned the butter.  Misread the recipe and heated oven only to 325. After 20 minutes discovered the error. Increased temp to 350 and baked for 15 mins more. Absolutely fabulous! The strawberries were caramelized, and the cake had a beautiful color and texture. I will never use Julia’s clafoutis recipe again, and I intend to make my temp/timing mistake each time I bake this. Plus browning the butter added so much umami. Almost as good the next morning at room temp with coffee. A real keeper.","1592402588","343"
"107618911","Caroline","I have some nectarines that need to be used. Do you think it would work in place of the strawberries?","1592264611","277"
"107650050","Klom","This is the first time I felt the need to add a comment after several years of happily trying NYT recipes. Expected this to be a little heavy and wet but it is the airiest cake - and also moist! Needless to say this came out great. Followed the recipe with some extras - grated fresh young ginger roots to the strawberry-sugar  mix, zested lemons and added 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla bean paste into the wet ingredients before adding the dry ingredients. Am in Bangkok. Will use ripe mangoes next time.","1592411367","261"
"107621326","Mark","I’ve made versions of this recipe before; it’s basically a clafouti, a French cake. The first version I made years ago was from a Jane Brody cookbook. Any fruit is good in it. I’ve used blueberries, tart cherries, peaches and strawberries, solo or mixed together.","1592276334","240"
"107625510","Sean","The big distinction being that clafoutis is very egg rich and this cake interestingly enough has no eggs.","1592312031","226"
"107620776","Summer","My family inhaled this in one sitting!  We used Bob’s Red Mill 1:1 gluten-free flour and fresh-picked strawberries.  Served it warm with strawberry ice cream (made from scratch also with our garden berries).  What a summer treat!","1592273292","192"
"107625252","Faith","My grandmother taught me this recipe over 50 years ago. She called it Lazy Woman’s Cobbler. I still use that recipe and alternate the spices related to the fruit and season. So easy to make and take to family and friends. I tried this recipe as written worked perfectly.","1592311388","185"
"107650174","Liana","I just made a version of this (with rhubarb) where the last step before oven involves sprinkling top with another 1/2 cup of white sugar and then pouring a 3/4 cup of heavy cream over the top of everything (use a deeper pan). Cream intermingles with the cake, fruit, and sugar to make a golden-brown custard-y topping. We still had the ice cream.","1592411728","182"
"118550925","LittleBird","Bakers' commentary has saved me again. I'm feeling so very low - children massacred; men defending gun rights; unprovoked war; people feeling free with hate.  Then - Sara James: ""I ate this whole thing by myself. All of it."" and Mary: ""I love my baked goods with poisons.""  I cried with gratefulness that there is still lightness.  The world may be saved by bakers.  Thank you.","1653774529","176"
"107625306","Lu","I made this with fresh cherries (I used 22, cut in half after removing the pits) and added a drop of almond extract to the cherry/sugar mix.  Delicious !!!","1592311536","165"
"107723749","Kathleen Russell","DON’T MAKE THIS CAKE! It is highly addicting.","1592845331","146"
"107648862","Sharon Lansing","NYT Notes:  - This is a riff on an old fashioned recipe called “Essies Cobbler”.

"107657596","njsavageblu","First, way too much sugar. I'd use only 1/2 a cup total. Second, way too much butter for such a small cake. I'd use half a stick. Third, too little strawberries. I'd use 1 1/2 cups not 1 cup. Fourth, white flour is poison, I'd use whole wheat flour. Fifth. Salt is also poison and unnecessary. Sixth. The baking time is all wrong. More like 35-45 minutes.  Try making it this way and it will be much tastier and a whole lot healthier!","1592437043","120"
"107645296","Colleen","This recipe is a great last minute go-to and doubles easily, with the addition of about 10 min more baking time.","1592399481","97"
"107680757","MTB","fabulous recipe  be sure to beat sugar and butter for the full 5 minutes -- makes it very fluffy  used 2 cups sliced strawberries  used half cream and half 1/2 & 1/2, then added juice of half a lemon to make buttermilk; ended up with almost a full cup  used 2 tsp vanilla  added zest of half a lemon","1592532274","92"
"107631105","Kathy","What type of pan is best to use?","1592324090","88"
"107625645","Ann","I swapped out the flour baking powder and salt with 1 cup of self-rising soft wheat flour (White Lily in this case) and replaced milk with buttermilk. It was so good!","1592312351","79"
"107626522","jassybeans","It’s not a clafoutis - no eggs.","1592314277","70"
"107642094","EEY","Used scant cup ground oat flour, added 1/2 cup rhubarb, used coconut sugar (only a tablespoon or so on the fruit), thinned greek yogurt instead of milk, cut butter down a little too. Wow, so so good!","1592365785","69"
"107641140","Min.","Yes, this is definitely an old southern recipe that works great with self-rising flour. The Martha White Flour test kitchen called it a bake-through cobbler and always melted the butter in the baking dish first. Use any sweetened fruit on top that you like.","1592359060","63"
"107814814","Erin","I have made this three times now. I strongly suggest doubling the strawberries and cutting the sugar to 1/2 cup - 1/4 for the berries and 1/4 for the cake. I have always needed to bake it for 30+ minutes. It stays visibly gooey in the middle.  I also found I preferred salted butter to unsalted. You could probably cut even more sugar and it would still be good. This is an extremely forgiving recipe, which I unforgivably botched once and still managed to fix and serve.","1593219047","62"
"107620063","Roberta","I just pulled this out of the oven, and it looks and smells wonderful. I subbed soy milk for the cow's milk and Country Crock plant butter for the butter stick and used strawberries thawed from frozen. When I saw this recipe today and realized I had what I needed to make it, I was thrilled, as a warm dessert will be perfect on this rainy evening.","1592269958","58"
"107619277","Jess","Made this exactly as written with ""help"" from my seven-year-old, and it was delicious! Our family devoured it. A keeper for sure!","1592266161","54"
"108799072","CSN","Fabulous.  I added a peach.  No way this serves 4.  Served my husband and me and our 27 year old who looked at the entire serving dish as if it was his personal ramekin.","1598322928","47"
"109097563","Anon","I'm not here to low-class this place up, completely, but I just now made a single-serving version of this in a mug and nuked it and served it with Vanilla ice cream.  Lately, I've been trying the full family-serving versions of recipes and wasting a lot of hard-earned groceries in so doing. The mug version (or small pyrex bowl) I just made is very tasty - one loses any crispy edges of course - yet one gains greater control over the battery-ness of the batter.","1600020460","47"
"107694276","Diane","Since we are maintaining our social distance during the COVID shutdown, I have been delivering dinner on Fridays to my daughter and her family. This week I added this spoon cake--all ready to go in the oven. While I can't speak to this recipe personally, I'll share her message to me.   ""The spoon bread was outrageously yummy! Like strawberry shortcake + berry cobbler = YUMMMM""  I think that says it all.","1592653745","44"
"107620263","Amy","Caroline, I made this tonight and I think it would be fantastic with nectarines. I would suggest cutting them up in 1/2” pieces or smaller and let them sit with the sugar for a while. This recipe is easy and versatile. It is a keeper!","1592270810","39"
"110575230","Miranda","This spoon cake saved my life. I made this in the spring of 2020 at the height of the pandemic. I took it up to my bedroom (I was living with some difficult roommates at the time), sat on the floor, took a spoon to the sponge and ate the whole dang thing. It's sugar and butter. You can't mess this up and it WILL make you feel better.","1607789769","37"
"109229964","Chris Lacroix","I've spent the pandemic cooking recipes in my NYT recipe box. This is my absolute favorite. It tastes like happiness. I just finished the last piece for breakfast and am now planning the next. I might go with mixed berries -- raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries. Tart is key. It's what gives the desert its smile. And I'll serve it with vanilla ice cream AND whipped cream. Joy!!","1600721262","35"
"109349237","lucy","To Sara James, who ate the “whole thing” by herself:  yeah, I get that.  I came close.","1601320672","35"
"110892210","stf","If using frozen berries, discard the liquid after they thaw, and then mash them.  I kept the liquid and the cake was covered in too much liquid and the center was not cooked.","1609795541","35"
"107690053","Lauren M.","I added brandy to both the batter and the strawberry mixture. It was quite tasty.","1592614980","32"
"107713776","Kim","Sad that butter makes you sad.","1592793439","32"
"108134749","Georgia","Variation 1: Add 1 tsp of rose sugar into the strawberry mixture; adds a beautiful, subtle note. Variation 2: Add 2tsp of very aged, syrupy balsamic vinegar into the strawberry mixture.  Variation 3: sub out 2 tbsp of the butter with basil infused olive oil. Variation 4: brown the butter   add cardamom to taste into the batter (prob 1tsp or less; taste it-benefit of eggless batter.)  With any of these variations, use a biscuit cutter to mash the strawberries into the sugar. #clearlyaddicted","1594769092","29"
"107622882","LaurieG","David Lebovitz gives 140 grams as the equivalent to 1 cup of flour.  I've also seen 120-130, but David Lebovitz is my guru. Guessing it all depends on the flour, moisture it's absorbed, how packed it is, etc..","1592297194","25"
"107696916","AJVermont","I make a version of this all the time. An easy mix of 1:1:1 flour, sugar, milk plus melted butter in the dish first and some baking powder (basically what is in this recipe). My summer go-to is a mix of blueberries and peaches; in the winter its apples and cranberries.  I've always called it Potluck Cobbler. I'll try now with strawberries. So simple, so worth it.","1592665912","24"
"107722878","julia","The ratio of effort to result is outstanding! You can put this together in minutes. Next time I might add vanilla extract and lemon zest to batter. Also more strawberries.","1592843141","22"
"107689063","Gretchen","Great timing on this recipe! Using it twice this week :) I made a couple changes... doubled the recipe in a larger pan, baked 30 min, used GFJules gluten free flour, and buttermilk since I had it on hand. Turned out great (fresh strawberries), lots of compliments when sharing with my partner’s family. I have a second one baking right now to share with my parents tomorrow, and used frozen mix of strawberries, blueberries and mango. It’s a versatile and simple recipe I’ll use again!","1592604945","21"
"107932419","Alyson Hardin","From my husband whose favorite dessert for decades has been strawberry shortcake (biscuit, poundcake, whatever): ""This is better than strawberry shortcake.""  And you know what, it's about a million times easier too!","1593736825","20"
"107792176","Sarah","Made it vegan and it was delicious! Simple subs of Earth Balance butter and oat milk made it a delicious vegan dessert. Served with coconut whipped cream and everyone is in heaven. I also did 2/3 cups AP flour and 1/3 cup corn meal just because I love all things corn meal and it was great. Such an easy dessert that may be one of my favorites yet.","1593128823","18"
"108683898","Cathy","I made 2 this morning.  One using suggestion below with rhubarb and strawberry, the other with peaches (fresh and skinned 2).  The strawberry rhubarb I cooked in a butter greased hot cake 8 inch pan and topped with freshly ground cardamom and vanilla sugar.  The peach one I added 1/4 cup wheat bran to batter and cooked it in an 8 inch cast iron skillet (hot from oven with melted butter to grease it).  I topped the peach with candied ginger and vanilla sugar.  Wonderful esp cast iron peach!","1597748495","18"
"109214568","BostonCook1776","I’ve made this with all different types and combos of frozen fruit. Frozen peaches with blueberries, blueberries and strawberries etc. I highly recommend 1T of lemon juice for any fruit combo other than Strawberry- this was a big hit! I also mix the wet ingredients and the dry ingredients ahead of time. Then just as everyone is serving dinner chuck it together and in the oven.","1600650939","18"
"117702875","Caroline Ahn","Pure melt-in-your-mouth goodness. Ignore the naysayers and try making the cake with the original ingredients, no substitutions — a cobbler’s supposed to be a comforting treat! If you want a healthier dessert without “poisonous” white flour then you are welcome to just… eat fresh strawberries.  I’ve made this in a 8x8 square pan, in a 10-in cast iron skillet, and also tried splitting the batter into a small baking dish and a mini cocotte. Baking times didn’t change but shallower = crispy edges.","1649165033","17"
"107689366","Lynne Thompson","I have made a peach cobbler recipe for years (family recipe) that is something like this. But the extra butter and brown sugar make this even better! Especially the way you mash the strawberries. So easy, so delicious! I will make this again for sure.","1592608635","16"
"109218357","Rebecca","Phenomenal!!!! It’s simply divine.  This was so, so delicious but so, so easy - the perfect combination.  We made while on vacation - when you want a homemade desert but are feeling lazy.  This could also be great when you are hosting someone and need something really quick.  It would be sure to impress.  You definitely need to serve this with the ice cream, though I think it could also be good with homemade whipped cream.  Basically, make this now!!!","1600690360","16"
"111521427","J","Doubled the berries, reduced the sugar very slightly (by about 2 Tbsp and could have reduced slightly more), and added 1/4 cup almond flour for a portion of the AP flour because I had it lying around. Fab. Next time I would add 1/2 tsp of vanilla.","1613043913","16"
"107681730","susan m","Made this with 1 cup of strawberries and then a cup of blueberries. Used brown sugar and sour cream instead of milk. It is sooooo good.wil def make again","1592540662","15"
"107715585","KEP","Used buttermilk and gluten free flour since we had and upped the fruit to about two cups. Raves from who is not really a dessert guy. This will be a go-to for summer.","1592822984","15"
"107730108","Suzy","This was great!  I used Earth Balance vegan butter and Rice Milk for the whole milk to make it vegan.  So easy and quick.  I love that I have a recipe that I could put on the table in less than an hour if company pops in!  This is a GREAT recipe!!","1592868236","15"
"133971745","Katie","This recipe should be called the You-Can't-Screw-This-Up-Even-After-You-Forgot-About-the-Milk-to-Be-Warmed-to-Room-Temperature-and-Already-Put-the-Macerated-Strawberries-On-Top-of-the-Dough-and-When-You-Turned-to-Put-the-Pan-in-the-Oven-You-See-the-Milk-So-You-Scrape-Off-the-Macerated-Strawberries-and-Juice-and-Mix-the-Milk-Into-the-Dough-Right-There-In-the-Pan-Then-Reassemble-Everything-and-Then-Bake-It-and-Not-Only-Is-It-Beautiful-But-Also-Deeelicious. Don’t forget the new name.","1718663228","15"
"113132720","CC","This is honestly the most delicious dessert I have ever had (truly), and so simple to make. Since discovering this recipe last summer (2020), I have made it many times. It just gets more delicious each time. Tip: use the best strawberries you can find! Driscolls will get the job done, but if you can find strawberries from a local farm during peak strawberry season, you will NOT believe how amazing the taste is. Also use more strawberries than the recipe calls for! And ice cream is a must. Enjoy.","1622941862","13"
"113986200","Kyle","Made a game-time add chopped macadamia nuts to the top. Now it looks like I sprinkled the cake with handfuls of children’s baby teeth. Very disturbing…","1628266459","13"
"114200922","Steph","Made this last night with a couple of modifications flagged by previous reviews: browned the butter; cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup (it was plenty sweet!); added 1 tspn vanilla extract and 1 tspn almond extract; and doubled the strawberries. Served warm with vanilla Häagen-Dazs ice cream - pure heaven!","1629735569","13"
"107818957","Soumya","I agree, I left it in the oven for at least 40 minutes and it was still fine! Rather more caramelised which made it even more delicious. I’m going to try it with raspberries next! And maybe blueberries too!","1593262149","12"
"113177649","annyong","Happy to report that the cake survived the night, and now I'm eating it cold for breakfast. I might like it even more now, even without the ice cream. Agree that reducing the sugar and doubling the strawberries is the way to go.  Baked for 30 min. to get a really golden color. I also used browned butter for some extra nuttiness and my homemade vanilla sugar. Bonus points for minimal dirty dishes/low cleanup effort!","1623245431","12"
"116690292","Megan T.","I’ve started making a two-person shareable version with strawberries and rhubarb!  I halve the recipe and use a 6” round cake pan. Bakes for about the same amount of time and is perfect for those last minute dessert cravings.","1643776914","12"
"109087251","Anna","recommend melting the butter in the pan while the oven is preheating (leaving a bit in the pan and putting the batter in the hot pan create a lovely chewy crust) and also increasing the amount of fruit which can be any juicy fruit - peaches, blueberries, etc.","1599936946","11"
"107697362","SPB","This is overall an excellent recipe. I made it this weekend and it turned out amazing. I could not be happier with the result. It was moist and super flavorful. Even though it calls for 2/3 cup brown sugar packed, I used 1/2 not packed. It was really good and perfectly sweetened. Even with the Vanilla Ice Cream on top, it was really good and it worked perfectly well with the cake/bread. I would definitely recommend that people who like to cook or bake make this. It is simple and very delicious.","1592669139","10"
"108424973","Nino","Can make this gluten free by using Bob’s Red Mill 1-to-1 Baking Flour. Works out great! Maybe even a little better than wheat flour.","1596244623","10"
"109021321","Elizabeth W","This is a wonderful and super easy recipe! 20-25 minutes has been perfect when I’ve used TJ’s GF flour, but with whole wheat flour it has taken more like 45 minutes. I also agree with everyone on half the sugar and twice the strawberries—","1599609883","10"
"112212927","Barbara","I just made this, x1-1/2 and doubling the berries, and I still was able to eat the whole thing by myself.","1617074772","10"
"107730716","Rosalind","This was superb and easy and was nearly devoured by two of us!  I followed the suggestions of others and used a generous 2 cups of strawberries, and used dark brown sugar as well.  The finished result was tart and satisfying, and paired well with vanilla ice cream.  Like others, I don't think whipped cream has enough heft for this.  25 minutes of cooking time in an 8"" square with a convection oven was perfect.","1592872134","9"
"125892031","Robyn","This is an amazing dessert, which can be adapted to suit anyone's taste.  The leftovers are delightful with coffee the next morning.  For those who don't want butter, salt, and/or sugar in your dessert and don't like anything else about the ingredients or method, why don't you just make something else.","1687535061","9"
"111090943","allison","wow - this was amazing I went overboard with the strawberries used 16oz. and had to cook twice as long - but holy moly - yummy!!!","1610599213","8"
"118201095","MER","Very tasty - be sure to refrigerate any leftovers. I forgot to, and the strawberries do go rancid if left at room temperature for too long.","1651862308","8"
"118551929","Jane","Didn’t find anyone using Bob’s Paleo flour but the raves were impossible to deny.  I don’t know if I’ve ever seen a recipe with more raves.  I tried it with BOBS PALEO FLOUR and IT WORKED.  I followed some other suggestions in the notes: (i) doubled the strawberries, (ii) used dark brown sugar but 1/4 cup for each part, (iii) used half and half instead of milk, (iv) added 1T vanilla paste to berries and (v) cooked for 50 minutes.  At this point, I’m desperately trying not to eat the whole thing","1653782017","8"
"118646549","Matt","I followed njsavageblu's revisions, to the letter, and wound up in intensive care for three weeks! They told me they thought I wouldn't make it. Poison. That's what they said.","1654346217","8"
"107689076","Gretchen","Hi... I used GFJules gluten free flour and it was great! You should be able to substitute and 1:1 gf flour with decent results. I’d say Pamela’s or Bob’s Red Mill would be good too.","1592605115","7"
"107772367","Sharon","I just made it again, with cherries. Oh my. Heaven. Different texture than the strawberries but still good.   Next with peaches and blueberries.","1593047345","7"
"110025587","Lanam","This is comfort food. So so delicious about 10 minutes out of oven. The ice cream is critical.","1604863833","7"
"112650272","abbey","Well - I’m currently making this for the third night in a row - and this time, I’m doubling it. It’s so so so good.","1619743429","7"
"113317449","Adelle","Doubled the recipe to serve a group; it took much longer in the oven than I expected and I worried that it was still under done but it turned out perfectly. I used dark brown sugar because I didn’t have light and while the color was much darker and more caramelized than the photo as shown, it was a huge hit with my entire family. This one is definitely a keeper! I think it would work beautifully with stone fruits, plums, nectarines, or any kind of berries.","1624150818","7"
"112812371","Sarah","This was so good and so easy. Mine didn't come out looking very nice, but it tasted great and I look forward to trying it with other fruits.   I served it with coconut ice cream which I recommend!","1620833874","6"
"113389352","Deb","This recipe is forgiving of all subs and truly delicious. I used vegan butter, macadamia milk, gluten free flour and coconut sugar. Any fruit would work though I did have strawberries. So easy and perfect for a dessert or a brunch/breakfast. I’ll definitely be making this again.","1624639791","6"
"118549502","Betty Ann","I have found that a potato masher is perfect for crushing strawberries (and other berries and soft fruits) evenly and efficiently for recipes like this.","1653766171","6"
"118680664","EE","I wish I had never made this because now I know how delicious it is and how stupid easy it is to make!  Very likely to eat this as a single serving for myself next time","1654552131","6"
"118760902","John Gordon","I’ve tried different spices with different fruit.  So far cardamom with strawberries, and cinnamon nutmeg with peaches, are my favorites.  Delicious any way it’s made.","1654891344","6"
"118938176","sadean","Made as is, but used about 2 cups of strawberries with same amount of sugar, to cover more of top surface of cake. Needed it! Baked in cast iron skillet. Very easy and a hit for guests!","1655996368","6"
"110716734","Brush","I made this cake yesterday. Unfortunately, there was too much liquid after baking at 355F for 45 minutes. I followed some recommendations (put little cinnamon, shredded ginger, and lemon zest) and used 2 cups of strawberries. I also used 1 cup of organic whole wheat flour, instead of all-purpose flour. If anyone has wisdom about what might have happened, I would appreciate it.  It was too syrupy and did not like the consistency of the cake shown in the picture. Thanks in advance.","1608618127","5"
"111702812","Anna","So good! Used blueberries and sprayed pan with baking spray and sprinkled sugar for a nice, crunchy edge. Served with ice cream. Baked for longer, about an extra ten minutes.","1614041942","5"
"112198043","Marie Inserra","So grateful for this egg free treat I can make for my granddaughter who has an egg allergy. This is a no fail hit every time and is becoming a staple when she visits.","1616974821","5"
"112458436","Lisa: delicious! will make again!","I tasked my 12-year-old w/ making this for dessert while I made dinner. It was easy enough that she could make it alongside me with little help. batter looked sparse but was more than enough; used extra frozen strawberries (probably 1 1/2 x berries called for); 15 min extra was needed in oven as others noted. after dinner, I left the room briefly. When I returned my family had devoured the entire spoon cake! all of it! we will make this again!","1618580783","5"

"122868848","Daria T","I can’t even tell you how delicious this cake is. It takes no time at all, and can be done with pretty much any fruit/berry that’s lounging in your fridge threatening to go bad. Although strawberry is still my favorite. Like someone else posted - this is good enough to be devoured in a single sitting. If I have enough self control - two. My husband is not allowed any. Treat yourself and make it tonight.","1675043995","5"
"125677882","Jay Bee","And now, I just made it for a third time this week. This time I used two tablespoons of butter. It was wonderful. By comparison, the version with a full stick of butter was heavy and greasy and overly rich. This recipe actually seems to improve with less butter...","1686599379","5"
"108657899","Eb","Added double the fresh strawberries (as suggested by some comments) which made the cake a little wet. Still delicious but the extra fruit added a good amount of juice (and resulted in a cake that was less fluffy, more gooey)","1597552133","4"
"111907421","Susie","Brown the butter-- so good!!!","1615169636","4"
"113245844","UL","First of all, this isn’t a clafoutis at all because there are no eggs in it. Whoever said that has no idea what they’re talking about. It’s quite delicious - actually my favorite thing is how salty it is. It tastes like a delicious salty, buttery pancake with strawberry sauce.","1623718210","4"
"113408554","Annie","I screwed up and forgot to add the baking powder and it was still delicious.","1624824220","4"
"113602879","carole","Was so eager to make this after reading the glowing comment.  Followed the recipe and some of the comments that suggested melting butter in the pan.  My guests were complimentary but I found it did not at all meet expectations.  Perhaps because it was room temp rather than warm? Made it right before dinner which lasted quite a while.  So glad I had great ice cream to go with it.","1626009287","4"
"118103167","Tamara","I also upped the strawberries (2 cups), used potato masher, macerated strawberries for close to an hour, so lots of juice and longer bake time. We had it for breakfast with yogurt on top. The best recipe ever for the nearly tasteless strawberries one finds in supermarkets. (Suggestion: If you don't have time to bake, macerate supermarket strawberries in balsamic vinegar and serve over vanilla ice cream.)","1651419532","4"
"118809967","DECREASE SUGAR BY HALF","I read the comments but decided to make the recipe as is - trust me - cut the sugar by half - just mash strawberries and do not had any sugar to them - you will thank me when you eat it!","1655217417","4"
"118868541","Lauren","Update:  MY employers loved the cake, so it appears I did not ruin it by cooking longer than recommended.  Next time I make it, I will leave a bare circle in the center (kind of like a monk's tonsure) so I can perform the toothpick test accurately, without going through a layer of strawberry puree.","1655500972","4"
"118915277","trulystormy","Make in the sq Pyrex rather than the round.","1655879557","4"
"125517347","Kristen","No.  You can use a regular 8x8 brownie pan.  Definitely double the strawberries.  Delicious!!!","1685915093","4"
"125530625","NHopeB","This cake is fabulous! I added 1/2 teas of cardamom to the macerating strawberries. I cooked it at 325 F for the first 10 mins and then upped the oven temp to 350 F. Caramelized the strawberries perfectly.","1685991933","4"
"125552103","Deanna","I doubled the fruit, halved the sugar and cooked for 45 minutes.  Delicious.  The strawberries added a lot of juice on the top but adding cooking time and checking with toothpick made it come out perfectly.","1686078716","4"
"125874184","Sue","Why does everyone keep comparing this to clafoutis, which is full of eggs, and this recipe calls for none. This is a cobbler!","1687463491","4"
"125874230","Sue","Clafoutis is eggy; this is nothing like a clafoutis.","1687463667","4"

"107696979","RB","VEGAN FAM: easy to veganize ! I’ve been making a Chicago tribune version of this for a long time- they called it “easy fruit bake” and I veganize it by using earth balance when Miyoko’s wasn’t available , and of course now use Miyoko’s. And it’s perfect !! Super yummy. Melting the vegan butter in the baking dish helps form a delicious crispy crust!","1592666198","3"
"109423480","S","Instant classic. When I was a kid, my mom made a variation of this in a 9x13 (?) pan. It was delicious, but making it in a round 8” dish makes it a little deeper for a moister cake.  I made it with frozen blueberries and cherries, and I added nutmeg and cinnamon since it’s October.  Next time I’ll do sour cherries and experiment with lemon zest.","1601590692","3"
"112612780","Bonnie Berry","This is delicious and very easy to make. I used gluten free flour and it was excellent. Highly recommend.","1619564671","3"
"113439123","Jen C","The ROI on this is outstanding. Super simple and utterly delicious. The only thing I’d do differently - double the recipe!","1624991218","3"
"118539750","Jan","Good dish.  I took the recommendations of others - added rhubarb; melted the butter in the baking dish, leaving some of it in the dish.  Lovely crispy sides but I think the rhubarb took away from the strawberries. Next time I'll use only strawberries.","1653694883","3"
"118648918","Lanette","Absolutely delicious as written. Next time I may add a drop of fior di sicilia to the batter or make it with fresh stone fruit. It’s an easy and adaptable recipe. Now I’m off to have it for breakfast with a cup of strong, black coffee.","1654360067","3"
"118735307","Sarah W.","Add vanilla!","1654793579","3"
"125525920","CKE","What a delicious and easy cake. My two year old was able to help me make this and the whole family enjoyed the end product. Make this cake!","1685979196","3"
"125582690","Hopsing","This is divine! To the comment from one who ate it ALL… I completely understand. I could as well. My only change was to reduce sugar to 1/4 cup in the strawberries and the same in the cake since the new season berries locally were very sweet. It’s fabulous and will surely be good with any juicy fruit and with some of the edits other cooks made. It is so good.","1686191848","3"
"125661254","Pat B","Cut the sugar to 1/2 cup but also have to note that I feel you need to add additinal strawberries when you serve it with ice cream.","1686523259","3"
"125700961","Kat","Brown the butter in the backing dish, then pour into the batter.  Add extra fruit too. Serve with unsweetened whipped cream. The best dessert ever.","1686696902","3"
"125775025","Allison","Absolutely delicious and super easy dessert.  I also increase the berries to about 8 oz and increase the baking time to about 45 minutes due to the increased juices.  I also find that letting it cool for around 30-45 minutes results in the best flavor.    What a great idea to brown the butter!  Will do that next time.  Can’t wait to try this with raspberries and peaches.","1686955054","3"
"125874145","Sue","This was very easy, very good, and easily served 4, or even 5. Hardly anything is ""too sweet"" for me, but I do agree with others who suggested cutting back sugar to total 1/2 cup.","1687463309","3"
"125875968","South Ender","Stick to the proportions—too many strawberries will keep center from cooking (as we found out the hard way). Because it was Juneteenth, we jazzed the strawberries up with a tiny dash of almond extract and 1/2tsp of sumac. Added nice layers.","1687469357","3"
"135136608","JLynn","Per reviews, Add vanilla and lemon zest to batter. Double the strawberries and cut some sugar.","1722552041","3"

"108131059","Ornella","I made this vegan by using vegan butter and oat milk. Turned out amazing!","1594754890","2"
"125382616","Amazing no-fail recipe for anytime!","Super delicious and quick to throw together. Per other reviews halved the sugar (1/2 cup total) and was generous with the fruit (used 110 grams of rhubarb and 60 grams frozen cherries). Was pretty thick when pouring into the dish but turned out perfectly! Great for breakfast, dessert, any time!","1685279631","2"
"125561799","Dee","This is the best! Make sure the milk is not cold at all, that's the only hard part. I like to use more berries and less sugar. I've mixed blueberries and strawberries - yummy! I want to try peaches next.","1686137373","2"
"125581289","hannah","I make this as often as possible when strawberries are in season. It’s a great way to use them when they’re starting to get soft or overripe, or if I buy a batch that has a lot of bruised and be. I’m sure I e made this with other berries too, and I know I’ve made it with peaches. It’s my favorite summer dessert.","1686187156","2"
"128042044","Emily","This recipe is so easy and delicious! I made it for my roommates after a night out (yes it's that easy) and we DEVOURED it. It pairs really well with ice cream, highly recommend!","1695845013","2"
"133963347","Lazy Cook Toronto","Seems like it’s mandatory to eat this cake solo, which seems indulgent. So I split it with my daughter.  Unfortunately, we’d baked it to bring to a party later today. Now we’ll need to bake another one. Hope we can keep our hands off it.   I doubled the strawberries and used 1/2 the sugar. Next cake, will do half each strawberries and raspberries.","1718639430","2"
"134574058","HellofromNC","So easy and yummy! Use more fruit as suggested as well as a dash of ground cardamom on top before baking it. Added ribbons of fresh basil once it was out of the oven. It was delicious!! Will make it again and again :-)","1720654590","2"
