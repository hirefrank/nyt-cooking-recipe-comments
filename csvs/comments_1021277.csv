"108350517","brooklynladyp","So delicious!  I had been craving a Greek salad so had all the ingredients. Used broccoli, and used homemade preserved lemons instead of fresh, oregano instead of cumin to continue the Greek vibe and added kalamata olives. Tossed with gluten free fusilli.  Had to stop myself from going back for more and eating what is supposed to be tomorrow's lunch!","1595893330","580"
"108408063","Barbara","Recommend seasoning all the ingredients recommended in a large bowl and then transferring to the sheet pan. It’s easier to coat everything that way. And don’t worry about measuring the olive oil. Use what you think you need.","1596162432","369"
"108368997","Susan Miller","This really does need to be served right out of the onion, or you risk the feta getting incrementally chewier as it gets cooler. Really good, used broccoli instead of broccoli And it worked well. Used only one block of feta, more than enough.","1595979144","362"
"108352603","Millie","Going through a heat wave so made this on the grill - layered a piece of parchment paper over a piece of tin foil and put everything on, then put on the (lowish heat) grill. Delicious!","1595901909","260"
"108393539","Katie","I used preserved lemon (NYT recipe) instead of fresh, used garlic because duh, and used cauli instead of broccolini bc it was the brassica I had on hand, it was GREAT!   I also modified this recipe to be vegan (and increased the protein!) by using tofu in place of feta (press then soak with a ratio of 1 Apple cider vin: 1 water: 0.5 lemon juice, salt, oregano, marinate x 6 hours-3 days).  It was amazing!  If you haven't eaten a lot of tofu this was approachable and delicious!","1596109207","229"
"108407829","Linnea","Way tasty. Tips:  Broccolini - one bunch is fine, but cut them into thirds (bottom stalk, middle, tops) for easier eating.  Onion - medium red onion is fine.  Grape tomatoes - need a box and a half.  Feta - cut block in half horizontally, then into quarters for 8 pieces total.  Tastes great over pearled couscous!","1596161422","136"
"108390211","Kendra","Delicious. Used cherry tomatoes and broccoli cut into bite-sized pieces. Because other reviewers said the lemon made it bitter, squeezed lemon juice over the entire pan before putting it in the oven. Also added a few chunks of lemon flesh, but avoided the pith/ peel. Truth be told, I looked at the ingredient list, barely read the recipe, and didn't measure anything, and it turned out great. This recipe is easy to riff off of and is very forgiving.","1596073492","127"
"108364565","LH","I added corn (roasted then cut off the cob) to the sheet pan, and also a diced garlic clove to the cooked orzo before mixing in the veggies.  Turned out really good and was so easy!","1595959432","125"
"108373504","Clio","I assume you could make this with haloumi, as they do in Europe. And red peppers would be a nice addition.","1596021994","101"
"108376167","Val","Would this work with tofu instead of feta?","1596030308","84"
"108419012","Elissa","I was super excited about making this and was sadly disappointed with the results.  I think maybe the pan was too crowded, or maybe it needed a higher temp like 450.  The vegetables were more steamed than roasted.  No browning or charring, just hot limp vegetables.  Feta was nice and warm.  I will try again but maybe spread it over two sheet pans, increase the temp, and perhaps crumble and sprinkle feta over it and broil for a few seconds.","1596220484","82"
"108354734","jassybeans","I’ll add another bunch of broccolini (one bunch between four isn’t really enough!)","1595924899","62"
"108425584","Carly","Delicious and easy and gorgeous! Wow. I cook fancy things all the time and never get a huge reaction from my boyfriend. He cleaned his plate and raved the entire time. I scattered a whole head’s worth of garlic around the pan because we love it. Served with sliced toasted baguette rather than rice. I can’t wait to make this again!","1596247944","60"
"108369118","Andy","Leave out the lemon. It leaves a bitter taste","1595979941","56"
"108393562","Katie","I did that! It was awesome! It takes a little more planning ahead to get a good marinate in the tofu, but very worth it! ""Vegan Tofu Feta Cheese"" by Simple Vegan Blog worked out very well!","1596109315","49"
"108370100","wendy","Great. One block of feta","1595985865","36"
"108351320","Kathy","Hey! I’ve been making sheet pan dinners on the grill! Takes a little heat management but tastes great & avoids the oven! I’ve used both charcoal & pellet grills. I’m going to make this one tomorrow night!","1595896494","32"
"112998219","karen","Try 425 or 450. Veggies steamed at 400.","1621986672","32"
"108404268","Kate E.","This is amazing although it involved turning on the oven which I have been avoiding in this heat wave! I used halloumi cheese, limes instead of lemons, broccoli and a regular onion. I served it with some fresh salsa. This is a winner and I will turn on the oven again!  Honestly, limes are my favorite ingredient!","1596145015","29"
"108404664","Alice","Delicious, attractive--and so easy. I used thinly sliced zucchini along with the tomatoes and red onion as we have a glut of zucchini at the moment. The timing was just right. I used 100 g (about 3 oz.) of feta for two people. Instead of orzo, I served it on top of a leftover rice dish. I will make it again.","1596146513","29"
"108390443","Gina Gleason","Was missing broccolini I so I used zucchini sliced into rounds. Also added yellow bell pepper (that needed to be used!). Did not have fresh basil, but didn’t miss it at all. The flavor and texture along with some freshly cooked, salty/lemony farro, was PERFECT!","1596074933","27"
"108390307","Kendra","I don't think it would be great made ahead. I'm sitting here eating it slowly and the texture of the cheese changes quite a bit as it cools. Everything else would work well, though.","1596074119","24"
"108391912","SundayCook","This is delicious. I used the zest of one large Meyer lemon and some of its juice instead of the lemon halves. I also added a red pepper, then I sprinkled it with cilantro from my garden. The two of us finished off the whole dish this evening.","1596087776","22"
"108407960","David","We prepared this almost exactly per the instructions (used two small bunches of broccolini and ⅔ of a large red onion.  Delicious!  Next time I might follow the suggestion of others to use preserved lemon -- the lemon slices were still too tart and hard to really eat.  And it took a bit more time to cook than suggested.  Served over orzo.  Will definitely make again!","1596161925","22"
"108406747","msue","Made this as close to the original recipe as possible - only subbing (pandemic adjustments) the broccolini with a mix of broccoli & cauliflower florets and some fresh green beans. Added a handful of kalamata olives too. Just a lovely, delicious, easy summer recipe. Very appreciated in this household!","1596156582","20"
"108784201","Barbara","I see a lot of people made substitutions, which sound interesting and I might try next time, but I’m here to say that if you follow the recipe exactly it’s wonderful. However, if you are using this as your main course, with nothing else other than farro/orzo, it is enough for four people. Three, at most (two, if you’re greedy like me!).","1598277080","19"
"108432032","Zeus G","I agree with Barbara in that it's much easier to toss in a large bowl than a sheet pan. It also seems I use less oil with a better result.","1596300268","18"
"108391304","Amanda","Made this with couscous and it was easy, quick and tasty! Truly a 30 minute meal. But I agree with others about the feta...unless you’re eating it right out of the oven the feta goes from soft and creamy to cold and solid. Next time I’ll crumble the feta unbaked right before serving to ensure some creaminess.","1596081127","17"
"108444806","barbara","I roasted chicken thighs for 35 minutes on a sheet pan, removed from the oven, and then added the entire recipe. Delicious!","1596406887","17"
"108391061","Nancy","Just made this tonight and served to hubby who was looking askance.  It was great, did serve with faro and some toasted  bread for crunch.  The Greek suggestions look good too.  Nice recipe, good colors and textures and satisfying.  It’s really hot in  Sacramento right now, but this was actually worth turning on the oven.  May make it on the grill next time.   Used  Trader Joe’s sheep milk feta.  Yumm.","1596079138","16"
"110759719","SLJ","I was looking for a recipe to use up a block of tofu and thought this would work. Holy smokes...this was delicious! I marinated the tofu for a few hours in lemon, garlic, oregano, olive oil, salt and pepper and used broccoli. Definitely will try with feta next time and more broccoli. Yum!","1608850590","14"
"111249908","Eric Brandt","We’ve made this after every grocery trip since it was first published, so about every two weeks during the pandemic. On the lemon debate, I add the slices to the sheet pan, then discard them before serving, but each plate gets a lemon quarter to squeeze over. I usually can’t help mucking around with recipes, but after at least a dozen outings I have yet to stray on this one.","1611591990","14"
"111628891","B","We’ve made this about 10 times now. I’ve made only 3 changes. (1) used thin skinned lemons (Meyers) or preserved lemons. (2) added sliced red peppers. (3) added more broccolini because we love it cooked this way. The basil adds nothing & costs too much. Don’t crowd the pan so everything can brown vs. steaming. And we’ve settled on roasted potatoes as the best side vs. grains.","1613636334","13"
"112304044","ejb","I had literally no opinion of farro until I made this dish with farro, and now when I see farro it’s like when my husband (who did not like small, scruffy dogs) sees a small scruffy dog now that *we* have a small scruffy dog, and his heart explodes.  A PILE OF VEGETABLES made me feel a fondness for a grain that should be reserved for small, cute animals.  THIS IS A FANTASTIC DISH.  Get nice feta.  Always get the nice feta.","1617675355","12"
"110972885","Lisa KK","Halved the lemon and roasted it face down on the sheet with the rest of ingredients. When I removed from over, squeezed one half over the cheese, briccolini etc.  was really tasty and so simple to prepare. Would definitely make this again.","1610072094","11"
"111728444","James","One of the best recipes. We have made this once a week since we read about it and never tire of it. The only addition is a generous handful of kalamata olives.","1614180339","10"
"109146114","CathyJ","Being a vegan, I have cooked this recipe so many times, and it just gets better.  Last night, I used broccoli, small fingerling potatoes cut in small triangles, cubed eggplant and Flavor Bomb cherry tomatoes. Along with spices, lemon slices, red onion and cilantro, I swapped dairy feta for Violife vegan feta.  All the spices remain the same.  The only difference is the vegan feta is placed on top of the vegetables after they have cooked and cooled for about 5 minutes to avoid melting.  Delicious","1600283350","9"
"108390069","Eric","I don't usually cook vegetarian, but this was tasty and surprisingly filling. Next time I will cut the lemon slices into thin strips (and use maybe a quarter of a lemon. If you get a whole slice on your fork, the lemon drowns out the rest of the flavors.","1596072740","8"
"108432018","Kate","I added summer squash, fresh thyme and sage---just sprinkled them over the top.  Then I waited half way through the bake and added crumbled feta  (all I had in the house).  It was amazing!  Even my veggie-versed husband loved it.  Thanks!","1596300043","8"
"108495795","Olivia","Delicious. Have made twice this week (so far). First time, I followed recipe closely (just swapped broccoli for broccolini) and served over chickpea orzo. YUM! Second time, I subbed shrimp in for tomatoes (had shrimp to cook, ran out of tomatoes) and used broccolini. Ate this version over Bibb lettuce and YUM! This a no-fail, worth turning on the oven, kitchen staple, totally delicious, gorgeous, and filling meal. Keep the lemon, cumin, pepper flake, or basil, but everything else is riffable.","1596672426","8"
"111738889","Jill E.","Used 2 bunches broccolini, red onion, 1 pt grape tomatoes (""Sun Gold"" orange ones), preserved lemon, small red onion cut in wedges, 5 garlic cloves, 10 pitted kalamta olives and 1 block feta.  Mixed the marinade first (as directed), then tossed all veggies in the marinade in a large bowl.  Roasted with feta slices on a parchment-lined half sheet pan for 18 minutes.  Served over a blend of brown, red & black rice, with chopped fresh basil leaves on top.  Fantastic!","1614224335","7"
"113259030","Amanda St. Clair","This is such a family favorite.  I add some shrimp in the last 5-7 minutes to really make it a complete meal.","1623791923","7"
"111644995","Robert Stephens","This dish might benefit from roasting tomatoes separately then tossing in at the end. The tomatoes left a lot of liquid in the pan causing the onions & broccoli to get steamed versus browned. The extra time to brown things causes the feta to stiffen too much. A bit more research might improve this recipe.","1613698156","6"
"108390791","Anne","Came here to ask the same question. I think I'll marinate tofu in one of the many NYT Cooking marinades, and lay that down in addition to a bit of feta. Actually this recipe seems like a great outline even if you've only got chicken thighs, for example, as your protein!","1596077220","5"
"108548524","Grandie","FANTASTIC!!! I used 1-8 oz. block of feta, as I thought this would be enough for dinner for 2. Next time, I’ll use 2 blocks, as the feta added so much flavor & we have enough left for another dinner. I couldn't find Broccolini & used a big head of Broccoli instead. It worked out just as well. BTW...If you’re using Broccolini, I’d recommend using 2 bunches. I also didn't have basil, but it seemed to not matter, & used the entire lemon (sliced) on the pan. Served w/Orzo & crusty bread for dipping.","1596986088","5"
"111566297","Doug","If ""real"" feta isn't on your dietary plan, Violife Vegan Feta is a very passible substitute.","1613246428","5"
"108423080","Amanda","Delicious and filling! I used 2 small bunches of broccoli and would use 3 or 4 next time.","1596233876","4"
"108577316","Suzanne Sparrow","I added capers, white beans, zucchini, yellow and red peppers to the roasting, ( it took two pans) and turned it into a meal.  Family loved it.","1597156397","4"
"111610364","Vicki","Amazing, recipe, and so easy!   The grilled red onions were particularly sweet and delicious.  Done in 17 min. I served it over my favorite couscous recipe, Israeli couscous with toasted pine nuts and parsley.","1613565189","4"
"115852682","Joy","Delicious!  I changed it up a bit.  I used organic broccoli (florets) instead of broccolini. I added about 8 whole cloves of garlic. I used whole Ruby Red cherry tomatoes. I omitted the cumin and used Oregano instead. I held off on adding the feta until the end. Oven 425 degrees; bake for 35 mins then add Feta for an additional 12 mins.","1639094600","4"
"117023653","Britt","After reading the comments, I decided to follow the cooking time in the recipe but use the convection setting instead of the conventional oven. After 17 minutes, the vegetables and feta were perfect! The combination of flavors is incredible, and thinly-sliced sweet peppers added even more flavor and color. I can't wait to make this again!  By the way, I lined the sheet pan with heavy duty aluminum foil and didn't need to wash it afterward.","1645410942","4"
"118946011","Natalie","I’ve been adding kalamata olives and chickpeas. Serve it with a warm baguette. Perfect meal.","1656023343","4"
"111614240","Ellie","A great recipe! Heres a few tweaks: used Roma tomatoes (seeded & cut into pieces), a Red Pepper (seeded & cut into pieces), 1-2 tsp. Litehouse Italian Seasoning Blend instead of Cumin or Oregano and tossed with ALL other ingredients in Olive Oil. Spread all on the sheet pan, placing long sliced block of Mt. Vikos Feta Cheese through out and layering top with scattered ""thin slices"" of an entire Meyer Lemon. Roasted as directed and served with BBQ Chicken Breasts/Thighs and Rice on the side. WOW!","1613575856","3"
"113895968","Martha","I made this just about as the recipe instructed except for a few changes. After reading other notes I did not put in the lemon slices, instead squeezed a whole lemon over it all.I mixed everything in a bowl before putting it onto a pan. Then nestled the cheese in between all the veggies. I did not use as much cheese as recipe called for because I only had 6 oz, but for 2 people it was fine. We even had leftovers. Used broccoli because that’s what I had. I was so Delicious!!","1627684156","3"
"114156317","greenb","We took this as an opportunity to clear out the fridge, using a number of close-to-expiration veggies on hand: fennel, zucchini, poblano pepper, red onion, chunks of tomato rather than cherry tomatoes, plus some halved kalamata olives and fresh oregano from the garden. Roasted at 425 convection for around 25 minutes, used a full size sheet pan to avoid the steaming problem others have mentioned. Served with a baguette and a nice chilled bottle of rose -- perfect summer dinner!","1629381865","3"
"110088462","Rose","Delicious! I added sliced chicken sausage, olives and smoked paprika. Took others’ advice and used preserved lemons instead of sliced. Drizzled olive oil and dried oregano on the feta. Used broccoli.","1605117345","2"
"121789410","eaevanspdx","Taste is great and yes and very beautiful to look at - but easier to put all vegetables in a bowl first then add olive oil etc.  And you need a really big sheet pan to fit two blocks of feta.  I ended up using only one as I did not have room for two.","1669949684","2"
"135704097","Julie","Made a version of this last night using tofu instead of feta, broccoli instead of broccolini, added mushrooms, and boc choy. That’s the beauty of this recipe, almost anything works.","1724613436","2"
"135910439","Angela","This is one of my favorite go-to recipes for getting non-veggie lovers to enjoy veggies! Something about the lemon slices and cumin combination really elevates the dish to taste much more complex than it was to cook. I can throw this together so quickly, and it's quick to clean up too, perfect for weeknights.  Pro tip -- use a larger baking tray than you think you need so that you don't crowd the pieces too much. If you find it getting crowded, split it up into 2 trays and rotate them halfway!","1725382254","2"
"136119730","Rachel","Delicious! I added a lot more spices to the vegetables including Zatar seasoning, oregano, and Aleppo pepper. I also added olives at the end.","1726103384","2"
"136127405","Robin","I have been making this for years, since the recipe came out before. I am not a fan of broccolini, so I slice up squash, zucchini, eggplant, grape tomatoes, mushrooms, sweet onion and place them in a large bowl. I sprinkle 3 tablespoons of olive oil and mix. I then use oregano, garlic, salt and pepper and whatever other spices I decide on at the moment. I then place on a cookie sheet (it makes enough for two cookie sheets), place the feta cheese throughout, and bake. I serve it with garlic bread","1726144474","2"
"136151548","Rivers L","I recommend using feta in brine if possible, it baked better in this recipe for me. Also if you want to add some sweetness, drizzling with honey was delicious. Ate over orzo and with some roasted salmon-delicious!","1726191515","2"
"136233821","Susan","Used one 8 oz block of feta, cut in 1/2, then thirds. Served over farro. Bright flavors, beautiful, and filling. Will try using garlic instead of cumin next time. The lemon and cumin didn’t jive as well as garlic and lemon might.","1726530181","2"
