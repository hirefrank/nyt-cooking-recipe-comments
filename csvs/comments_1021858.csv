"111497180","Anna","A lot of chiles have one name when fresh and another when dried. The guajillos are dried chiles, which is why the recipe toasts and then soaks them before blending.","1612896599","405"
"111504306","Prairiedogg","why a skillet, then an oven proof pot? why not just use a dutch oven for all?","1612939913","259"
"111511868","stephanie","a fine way to toast chiles without dirtying dishes or worrying about burning them, is to put them on a paper towel and just microwave them for fifteen to twenty seconds. (this is a kenji lopez-alt method and it really works! just, if you're toasting spicy chiles, resist any urge to deeply inhale as you open the microwave ;))","1612981544","230"
"111565418","Ricardo Figueroa Quiroga","The secret recipe from my Great Grandmother also includes a 1/4 of a chocolate tablet (mexico Chocolate Abuelita) and it makes a difference.","1613238459","167"

"111503894","alex g","This was great. I bought some chuck roast, and left in an extra hour to simmer, though at 300. Outside of that, I followed the recipe and it came out super tender and packed with flavor. The whole house smelled so good.  I made some pickled onions, added some avos, cilantro and lime. It’ll be great as tacos for leftover.","1612932786","113"

"111495460","Louis Peña","There is a growing vegan scene in Mexico which seems unique compared to Mexican-American vegans. For that I look to blogs by Mexicans in Mexico (you can run Google Translate). Here is a birria example: <a href=""https://loveveg.mx/receta/birria-vegana"" target=""_blank"">https://loveveg.mx/receta/birria-vegana</a>/    JACKFRUIT is another option I’ve used. But don’t use straight out of can, you must sauté pieces first to drive out water, adding a little oil, dash of smoked paprika, cumin and nutritional yeast to coat before using in this (or any Mexican) recipe.","1612891624","67"
"111500563","UWSGrrl","I can’t see why you can’t make this dish with beef short ribs.  Any meat that you’d normally braise or stew should work. I’ll be making it this weekend with a combo of beef short ribs, and oxtails.","1612910325","61"
"111540318","John","This is almost exactly what I have been doing to make birria, which I kind of pieced together from a few different recipes online. I like to add a couple anchos or pasillas and a couple chiles de arbol, as well as some coriander and a couple allspice berries. A mix of oxtail, short rib and chuck roast works great if you can't get bone-in beef shoulder","1613119115","60"
"111509853","SLP","This calls for 5 lbs of bone-in shoulder roast.  Anyone know how many pounds of boneless shoulder or chuck roast would substitute?","1612974594","52"
"111513083","stephanie","i thought the amount of chiles in this recipe seemed kind of puny and then i read the accompanying article. it states in regard to mr. centeno ""The foundation of his recipe doesn’t change: warm spices, about eight kinds of chiles, a lot of cilantro and canned tomatoes."" of course the article goes on to say there's no ""one"" version of birria, but since this is specifically based on centeno's it's kind of sad the main ingredient has been stripped down so much. would love to know the actual recipe.","1612986522","50"
"111497394","Oskar M","Like Anna said, gaujillos are dried. The fresh form is called mirasol.","1612897392","47"
"111510708","CQ","Is there a way to cut this recipe in half? Would it be a mistake to just divide all of the ingredients by 2?","1612977469","45"
"111494927","Aaron Lawson","I suspect fried tofu or firm tofu that has been frozen, thawed and squeezed would be best for this, or it will fall apart and become nasty. Another option would be the bean curd knots (sometimes called yuba) that can be found at Asian grocery stores -this is tough, thin sheets of been curd that has been sliced and knotted, and partially dried -it can hold up to long cooking. One more thought would be to try this Mapo Tofu style, adding very soft bean curd right at the end.","1612890364","40"
"111510457","TriciaPDX","Poblano and guajillo peppers aren't particularly hot, especially after the seeds are removed.  Guajillos are somewhat more picante than poblanos but as the dish simmers the spiciness tends to mellow.","1612976628","26"
"111510171","Regan","We make a version of this with oyster mushrooms marinated in cider vinegar and spices for 30 mins or so, then pan fried until crispy.  It's delicious and the mushrooms hold up really well.","1612975682","25"
"111510575","Gita Vohra","you can grind a  2 tbsp of fennel seeds and 1 tbsp of Carom seeds and 1tsp of cumin seeds together and that would give you a very close taste to oregano, actually better.","1612976996","25"
"111866860","rickc10","This was amazing! Whole family loved it. Made few relatively insignificant changes: used beef stock instead of water, caramelized the onions quite a bit, added much much more garlic than listed, used a combination of poblano, guajillo, and pasilla peppers, added some tomato paste and also some Mexican chocolate (minimal, but added a nice undertone). Once I make this again, I’ll likely do the same because the result was amazing. But I’m not trying to show off - particularly while being a deviant.","1614894028","25"
"111510035","Pat","Yes, I made this yesterday using boneless country ribs because that is what I had and couldn't wait!  It was fine.  I was not thrilled with the recipe as it was too mild and a bit one-note for my taste but that's just me.  Next time I'll add a few spicier peppers.  Also, I did not add the 4-6 cups water and instead used whole canned tomatoes with its juice and that made a ton of sauce.","1612975241","20"
"111501943","Pranav","Made with goat meat and it was absolutely divine. Exact same process except cooked in instant pot - yum!","1612917666","18"
"111490339","Fast Marty","I'm getting so hungry reading this. I'm going to do it this Sunday, for sure. Thanks for the recipe!","1612879454","12"
"111516013","TriciaPDX","Guajillo is a dried mirasol pepper.  Ancho is a dried poblano.  The flavors of dried peppers are not quite the same as fresh peppers, but probably close enough for a long braise.","1613001760","12"
"111490678","Helen","If you are vegan/vegetarian you know how to substitute.  Tofu/chicken instead of beef?  Less time likely.","1612880396","10"
"111489804","renee","So how do you make this with tofu?  What about chicken?","1612878100","9"
"111605216","Debra Emery","I only used the poblanos and added 3/4 can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce.","1613512323","9"
"111954559","dimmerswitch","Chase Karacostas - you ask about doing the poblanos without  a gas stove or grill.  Pop them under the broiler, keep an eye on them, and turn them as the 'up' side blisters.","1615405664","9"
"111602616","Rick","Birria broth is traditionally thin, not as thick as a stew, more of a broth.","1613502366","8"
"111490211","Polly","My question as well. Need the vegan version. I assume you would add the earthy root vegetables as suggested but when and how to add the tofu?","1612879101","7"
"111505448","Tom, SFBA","Because it’s easier to work with them as directed in a shallow pan.","1612959618","7"
"111615176","Donna Lagarias","My purchase of pork shoulder was unintentional, and I substituted fresh Fresno chile (looks like a red jalapeno) for the guajilo which I couldn't find at the market, then blackened it as for the pablano. Added only 2 cups water at Step 7, as that was all I could fit in my oven proof pot. Otherwise followed recipe directions - this recipe is superb!","1613578127","7"
"111630668","AP","guajillo is always dried - it refers to a dried mirasol chili.  Like an ancho is dried form of poblano pepper, and chipotle is dried, smoked jalapeno.","1613653659","7"
"111513935","shannon","Any suggestions on the peppers in step 2 for those of us with electric stoves? I wonder if broiling them would work similarly? I know the flavor might be different but still might be move flavor than skipping that step completely.","1612990722","6"
"111956489","Susan Nakagawa","It's a matter of preference, but I find the flavors just about perfect. The blend of peppers, acids and spices yield something balanced and layered. I experiment a lot with recipes but followed this one just about to the letter with fantastic results.","1615414277","6"
"112368381","Beth Ross","I made this with an elk shoulder roast. The roast was only about a pound and a half, so I omitted the water and had quite a nice, thick sauce. Given how lean elk is, I browned one small grass fed beef marrow bone and roasted it with everything else. I cooked everything at 300F for about 5 hours. Perfectly tender and moist.  It turned out so delicious! The sauce was so dynamic with a perfect kick.  Served the meat shredded in the sauce with bay leaf fragranced rice and fresh corn tortillas.","1618022871","6"

"116731288","leah","I’ve made this many times, exactly as written, and it was amazing. I feel more confident in subbing things now that I’ve made it a bunch- so I use different types of chiles, different cuts of meat, etc. Its always a hit!","1643934161","6"
"111511942","stephanie","i would just cut down the size/quantity of the meat and reduce the added water, but leave everything else the same. (i haven't made this recipe but have made other birria recipes and other braised beef with chiles recipes as well, and this one already has very few chiles, imho so i wouldn't reduce.)","1612981821","5"
"111627066","jessica","I tried this with goat meat. I’m not sure what the cut was. But it was too lean, so the birria was tasty enough but not rich. I’d recommend a fattier meat.","1613614395","5"
"112381468","DRB","I like it as a structure for variation.  Can be a two person mission with one on the meat and the other getting the blender stuff done. Otherwise I’d do the blender stuff first then brown the meat and combine. Also I’d salt the meat AFTER browning, the salt makes the meat surface moist which makes it harder to brown.  It’s set up for you to mess around and try stuff. Enjoy.","1618163883","5"
"126948699","stephanie","the bitterness can come from the chile soaking liquid, which is why many people discard it instead of using it. also, the cinnamon sticks used in mexican cooking are called canela. i am not sure why, but NYT cooking almost never mentions this. if you look up a picture, you can see mexican canela sticks are soft and full of many layers, different in taste and texture from the hard single rolled things most of us think of.","1691768039","5"
"111543263","Mrs. K","Broiling will work. Put the chilis as close to the broiler as possible, and keep an eye on them. When the skin starts to blacken (around 10 minutes), take them out and continue with the next steps.","1613138697","4"
"111567914","dimmerswitch","Loui you ask ""Can you make this one day in advance? Also, can it be frozen? Thanks !""  Birria is great made ahead.  Like most braises it even improves.  And birria also freezes well.","1613253894","4"
"111688160","Barb in VT","We made this with poblanos and a variety of other fresh, hot peppers. Didn't add any water, and loved the results: a thick, complex, delightful sauce smothering the lamb. Served with quick pickled red onions. Delish!","1613997599","4"
"112190502","cocktail hour","Far more delicious than mere sum of its parts.  I used chuck roast and oxtail (what I could find).  Added a poblano, 2 anchos.  Had to cook 4 hours to get to fork tender, but very worth it.  So yummy.  Can’t wait to try the tacos.","1616913107","4"

"116113978","LittleBird","-add 1/4 of a chocolate tablet (Abuelita brand); it makes a difference.  -Spicer:  add a couple anchos or pasillas and a couple chiles de arbol, as well as some coriander and a couple allspice berries. A mix of oxtail, short rib and chuck roast works great if you can't get bone-in beef shoulder  -Vegan: JACKFRUIT -don’t use straight out of can, must sauté first to drive out water, adding a little oil, dash of smoked paprika, cumin and nutritional yeast to coat before using","1640792823","4"
"116289386","AW","This was fantastic. Used chuck roast and cooked it at 300 degrees instead of 325. Took 3 hours in the oven, but it was done perfectly at that point. Made a roasted corn salsa to go on the side.","1641777560","4"
"118568450","BigSkyGirl","Could not get a bone-in beef shoulder, so I opted for 4 pounds of boneless arm roast and four short ribs (about 1 pound). The rendered fat from the ribs allowed me to omit the oil. I added two ancho chiles that I had on hand with the guajillos, stemmed the cloves and used a scant teaspoon of toasted cumin seeds in place of the ground cumin. The aroma was incredible, and the dish was sublime.","1653958543","4"
"119762109","Charlene","Made this yesterday and it was a hit!  So flavorful and delicious.  It took a long time to prepare and clean up the mess.  The next time I make this I'll prepare the adobo in the morning (or the day before) and finish it up later in the day for an evening meal.  Tried to find Abuelita Mexican Chocolate to add as suggested by another reviewer, but my grocer doesn't carry it in the summer months.  I'll definitely try that addition once I can get my hands on some Mexican chocolate!","1660069007","4"
"127037461","Henessee O. Ping","Earthy, fruity, sweet, piquant . . . delicioso! Meat: 3.5 Lbs Beef back ribs, 2.25 Lbs (+/-) Boneless short ribs.
