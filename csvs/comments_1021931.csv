"111683788","malahat","Tried this technique, and the result was as advertised — beautiful scrambled eggs. And it’s not complicated or fussy.   I find myself wishing this website could screen out comments from people who didn’t actually try the recipes.","1613939399","555"
"111661756","Michael","Kenji does it again. These eggs are incredible. I cooked them without telling my wife and tried to play it off like it was just a good batch. They are so good, she caught on. If you don’t want to use this much butter, use less butter.","1613770584","371"
"111672027","Margie","Like so many NYT Food recipes where I have all the ingredients on hand, I had to try it this morning.  I believe in respecting the recipe and making it as described before I make adjustments.  I made it as described but halved it for just me.  I used a well seasoned cast iron pan.  The eggs were fluffy, creamy and delicious, just like I imagine royalty get from their 5-Star chefs.  I'll play with it now to reduce the amount of butter to protect my arteries like a Weight Watchers chef.","1613842966","301"
"111657565","Jeff","Tried this for lunch. Man is there a lot of butter for the amount of eggs it makes.  Pros:VERY DECADENT, great taste.  Cons: a little too rich for my taste.  Verdict: very tasty but probably won't make again unless I'm trying to gain weight for a hypothetical wrestling tournament due to how rich they are.","1613757217","296"
"111657996","rtrach","Making creamy scrambled eggs requires nothing more than a good whisk and... eggs. Zero butter. Even in the pan. If you whisk till foamy, pour into pan and continually move around with a rubber spatula under medium-low heat, things will turn out beautifully.","1613758349","290"
"111658842","Andrea","These were the exact right fluffiness.  I think the corn starch and the perfectly hot pan technique is a great idea. If you wanted to use a little less butter, you probably could be ok, but it's really good with the butter.  I made two eggs-- cut the recipe in half and it worked. (I also added a few chopped onions at the end if anyone is interested)","1613760707","227"
"111672485","Charles D","Good eggs! I doubled the recipe. Corn starch added no flavor. Served with English muffins to wife and kids. Plates cleaned! I think a lot of reviewers are missing the point; it's a technique to get fluffy eggs, quickly.  Like many of the reviewers, my usual eggs use only salt and butter, and turn out nicely, but I need low heat and constant stirring. At larger quantities that can be 15 minutes. This recipe gives me more grace, with quicker cook time.","1613844870","223"
"111662303","Carol","Just made these and they are *stupid* good 10/10 beautiful","1613772572","220"
"111732509","Deanna","OK, I tried the recipe. I did use a little less butter, but otherwise faithfully followed. I, too, have been making eggs for multiple decades, and in my experience, this technique produces scrambled eggs that are at least a couple of steps above the norm, with less time/effort than the very-low-heat method. For those of you who are set in your egg technique, please move along -- nothing to see here (and no need to comment). But for those open to improvement, I say give this a try.","1614190826","208"
"111722588","Michelle","For some reason this recipe is getting a lot of negative attention about being ""too much work"" but honestly it took me less than 5 minutes and they were the best scrambled eggs I've ever had. I finished them in the time it took for my bagel to toast!","1614144138","159"
"111667406","Legal Immigrant","I add a big splash of sparkling water to my eggs. The carbonation fluffs the eggs nicely.","1613825892","109"
"111666737","Andy","I made this exactly as written. I love you, Kenji. But these eggs where inedible. Soft and creamy but also slimy. They tasted like eggs cooked in corn starch with too much butter.","1613811751","99"
"111663603","Judith","This recipe is unnecessarily complicated.  I have been making scrambled eggs for 60 years; it was the first thing I learned how to cook by myself when I was 7 years old.  Scramble the eggs (now I use chopsticks - they mix the whites and yolks more thoroughly); heat butter in a pan; add eggs and move them gently around the pan with a spatula as they cook.  Turn off the heat before the eggs are completely set and slide them onto a plate.  They are fluffy and creamy and yummy.","1613777324","88"
"111660090","Henry","I dip the handle end of a teaspoon into the cornstarch and add that pinch to the eggs while scrambling. It takes all of 1 second, and makes for much creamier, smoother scrambled eggs. There's really no reason to skip this.","1613764546","84"
"111684645","Jay","This technique is INSANELY GOOD! Ignore the know-it-alls who pan it without even trying it, follow this recipe exactly and you will get the most delicious scrambled eggs ever. I used 8 eggs plus 4 yolks, a full stick of butter and a tbsp. of corn starch to 3 tbsp. of whole milk. Compared to the French/Ramsey method which takes 15-20 minutes, I think these actually taste better. Thank you Kenji!","1613945002","78"
"111664069","Holly","Impressed! I had to try it immediately. They are far more delightfully textured than my way of doing eggs.","1613779730","69"
"111662030","Warren Bobrow, 6x Author, Cannabis Alchemist","I asked the grill cook at the Summit Diner in Summit, NJ how he gets his eggs perfect- every single time.  He said use room temperature eggs. And lots of bacon grease on the flat-top griddle.  I've been all over the world and had scrambled eggs in many places. But none so delicious- albeit un-healthy as the Summit Diner. Ok, this tangle of goodness only get into my belly once or twice every six months- that's ok, right?","1613771568","49"
"111681143","Bill","I always microwave the empty plate I’ll be eating off of for about 45 seconds just before cooking the eggs to ensure they don’t cool too quickly while I eat.","1613925614","43"
"111754790","View from 9072","I had a dog named Scott who wore a blue ribbon on her tail. That is what you sound like when you have not tried the recipe and insist on giving you thoughts we do not care. Made this recipe as written the first time and it was delicious. The second time I use bacon fat in place of the butter for greasing the pan and it was even better. Made some for my wife and she said it was the best scramble eggs ever and passed on the recipe. Thank Kenji keep writing recipes we who try them love them.","1614299127","42"
"111666988","Mari","I use more-or-less the same technique - but I mix the eggs with a little milk in a jug before adding them to the melted butter in the pan. Cooking the eggs takes less than 5 mins - the trick, as you write, is to remove them from the heat before they are completely set, as they continue cooking in their own heat. Overcooking them (a matter of seconds!) is what kills the creaminess...","1613819680","41"
"111730013","Derricka","Using refrigerated (hard) butter and a coarse cheese grater works wonders vs using cubes.","1614183908","41"
"111685115","MaryPat","I just turned 71 & have been making scrambled eggs since my dad taught me when I was 5 years old. This recipe is like eating soft pillows of wonderful ness!","1613948878","39"
"111661083","Kevin","The extra egg whites can be used in meringue and whiskey sours.","1613768225","35"
"111732609","Miss Fig","Okay, I was just as skeptical as everyone, but tried this recipe today using 2 eggs. I skipped the cold butter in the eggs, made my slurry with whole milk and used less than 1 TB butter in the pan.  A revelation! Delicious, creamy, soft, tasty eggs - I am a convert. The volume seemed larger too. So much easier than my old method of cooking a long time over low heat and periodically moving pan off heat.  Try it haters!  You just may be surprised!","1614191173","35"
"116065032","jbm","I substituted potato starch for the potato starch and water for the water.  I also used butter instead of butter.  Instead of eggs, I used eggs, and I threw in nothing for added color.    These are really good.","1640360808","31"
"111783054","Brer.Rabbit","I wonder if all the people that unabashedly tout their own 'superior' techniques for a dish do actually cook the recipe that they are so quick to criticize and then compare the end result to their own methods? Like many others I also had a technique for what I considered to be wonderfully creamy scrambled eggs, but I cooked this recipe anyway and it really was wonderful - and quite a bit better than my own.","1614466724","25"
"111659951","King.Kray","Some of the early commenters may have missed the preface or are assuming everyone is an amazing home cook. A (forgiving) scrambled egg recipe without the fuss indeed.   <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/19/dining/perfect-scrambled-eggs.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/19/dining/perfect-scrambled-eggs.html</a>","1613764071","24"
"111729644","Scott","I ran across this recipe a few days ago and made the eggs this morning.  To all the naysayers, I disagree.  The butter and slurry were prepped in the time it took the pan to heat up, so no extra time at all.  The eggs were easy, and far fluffier and creamier then my usual efforts, even those made with a bit of milk. Super delicious and definitely will be the method going forward.","1614183038","23"
"111729725","Eve","Made these for breakfast this morning. Whole thing took about 5 minutes (10 if you include me nervously double checking the recipe and trying to do quick maths-- I only made 2 eggs). They are PERFECT. These eggs are so silky and creamy and delicious. I did not know that scrambled eggs could be so luxurious. If you either don't have the time or the ability for lots of whisking (I myself have an old ice cream scooping injury) this technique is for you.","1614183270","22"
"111732815","John","The primary benefit of the cubed cold butter is that it significantly increases the ""holdability"" of the eggs. So if you're going to wolf them down straight away, you probably don't need it as much. But if you're cooking for a crowd and would like to hold the eggs warm for 20 minutes, the butter makes all the difference. And as others have noted, this ""higher heat"" method does produce more volume than the low-and-slow method, no question.","1614191948","20"
"111732770","John","I don't disagree that it's possible to make amazing eggs without potato starch and butter and all that — but seriously, try this before you say that your eggs are perfect the way they are. You just might change your mind. And although it sounds like a hassle, it literally took me 90 seconds longer to prep than just making eggs the ""usual"" way. And to make it easier, it's not really necessary to cube all the butter — only half of it. The rest goes into the pan to foam, so  cubing not needed.","1614191787","19"
"111772222","Joule","Wow, I was skeptical because I thought I made good scrambled eggs already, but these are the best scrambled eggs I've ever had. They taste velvety and rounded like the chickens had a good life with lots of extracurriculars. I felt I got more yield from 2 measly medium-size eggs. Used half the potato starch and water for 2 eggs and less than a tablespoon of butter.","1614383375","17"
"111729898","amazing as is!","Made this exactly as the recipe called for and they are fantastic!  The naysayers on here didn’t actually try the recipe. It’s worth the few extra little tips and tricks to get these results. Kenji never disappoints!","1614183671","16"
"111658642","Stephanie","With this level of butter you definitely need some toast or salad with it.  I made this to eat straight up and found it pretty greasy.  Cornstarch is a great trick and I'll probably use that going forward when I do larger batches of scrambled eggs.","1613760231","13"
"111729742","Ms D","Tried, but never again.  Of course, they're tasty - two tablespoons of butter per serving would make anything taste good.  That's over 200 calories just for the butter and 23 grams of fat, close to half the daily recommendation from Cleveland Clinic.     Maybe I'll wait until my 90th birthday for the next serving!","1614183309","12"
"111664051","Elgin Martin","He says that ""For creamier eggs, you can replace the water with milk or half-and-half.""  But it's only a tablespoon and a half of water in the recipe!  What kind of super-concentrated milk is being used :) !","1613779631","11"
"111737622","Amanda","Really wish people would try a recipe before commenting. Great recipe for “loose” scrambled eggs. The butter makes it very rich. A nice change from my normal scrambled eggs.","1614217398","11"
"111881675","Iva","I just made this recipe by Kenji and it's fabulous, just like all of his recipes.  I know I can trust any recipe by Kenji and his cookbook is incredible.  As a former Home Economics major (yes that degree existed once upon a time) I can only say that if I'd had Kenji's book at the time I would have enjoyed my foods/nutrition classes so much more and understood why I needed so much chemistry for that degree.","1614969647","11"
"116099785","Steve-o","Like some of the other commenters here, I can make perfectly good scrambled eggs without corn starch or half a stick of butter. These eggs are better than perfectly good. In the words of someone I served them to, “These eggs are insane.”  If you are even a slightly curious person, make them before commenting.","1640706669","10"
"111673920","Mrs Goldberg","Off the charts--the scrambled eggs of my dreams, silky, tender, delicious. And I used only half the butter. We ate them with warm homemade challah. These are in no way an ""everyday"" dish for us but I will return to them for a special breakfast or supper as an easy comfort dish. Pure golden buttery egg love.","1613853552","9"
"111731441","Ellen S","I followed the recipe using cornstarch.  I won't make it again.  Fluffy, yes, but the texture was unpleasant;  slimy doesn't quite describe the feel.   But try it anyway.  You probably have the ingredients, and you might like the results.","1614187468","9"
"111732162","LarryAt27N","An earlier NYT recipe for ""perfect"" scrambled eggs called for adding a splash of half-and-half to the eggs and cooking the blend over very low heat, pushing and folding, for a few MINUTES.     I add a large pinch of shredded cheddar. Diners will not taste the cheddar, only the added flavor dimension.   With zero fanfare or introductions, I served it to my wife and waited to see how or even if she would respond to this novel recipe.  She looked up and said, ""These are the best eggs I ever had"".","1614189666","9"
"111790903","Greg Proffit","So...just made these. I increased recipe ratios for six eggs. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and instructions to the letter.   Honestly, the best scrambled eggs of my life. My GF agrees. Couldn’t be happier with the texture, fluffiness, and creaminess.   Next time, if I make 6 again, I will reduce the butter from 6 tbs, to 5. There was enough buttery glisten left on the serving plates that obviously didn’t didn’t absorb, that I think I can get way with that.","1614532288","9"
"111697295","Andrew Vancouver","That's a lot of butter for 4 little eggs.","1614020786","8"
"111733514","Elena","My mother made the silkiest, butter-infused scrambled eggs for 11 children on an almost daily basis before we went to school. She did this effortlessly. With no slurries just a double boiler. For some reason all of this mayhem about scrambled eggs reminded me of her standing in high heels dropping egg after egg into the double boiler along with a large knob of butter and some room temperature cream. They remain the finest ones that I have ever eaten. Thanks for the memory, but not the recipe!","1614194522","8"
"111735144","DJ","Way too much butter here. And I am pro-butter!  A Tbsp per egg is too much of a good thing.  Just mix the eggs as usual, heat your pan as usual, add a little butter (1 tsp.) and a dash of olive oil. Once the pan is ready add MOST of the beaten eggs reserving a bit. When the eggs are nearly done add the remaining egg liquid, give a quick stir and serve.","1614202094","7"
"111778171","justin","Yes, you can cook scrambled eggs in many ways, often easier than this recipe. But! They will not be these eggs, which are seriously the best I've ever cooked. Wonderful recipe and technique.","1614440136","7"
"111778200","Mary","I don't like eggs and these eggs were great. I raise chickens, so have a surplus of eggs and I am always trying to find good ways to make them. I will definitely make this recipe again.","1614440282","7"
"111829189","ShadowThuy","Made this once as written - too much butter! So rich! Made it again with half the butter, but I used half & half instead of water for the slurry (as suggested in the recipe tips). Perfect! And for the folks from Hawaii, who love their scrambled eggs over rice, I added soy sauce to the mixture before cooking. Even more perfect!! This is a keeper, as is this chef's method for the perfect boiled eggs.","1614719152","7"
"115964978","Danielle","Made these for breakfast this morning. Would probably cut down on the butter because it was a little too much for me, but the recipe was foolproof and got me fluffy, delicious eggs quicker than cooking on a low flame like the typical scrambled eggs recipe. Again, as other commenters said, don't comment on the recipe saying your method is better/less complicated if you didn't even try this. It's awesome!","1639750180","7"
"111769560","Raj","Followed the recipe to the T (not really that hard anyway) though used cornstarch. Came out absolutely perfect and my girlfriend who was very skeptical until the first bite was totally impressed!  The many steps might look laborious but it really comes together in about 5 minutes. Definitely worth it!","1614371867","6"
"111859724","Biltu","Lovely recipe. I was never a big fan of quick egg items until I came across this. On my second attempt, I decided to spice it up a bit to satisfy my Bengali tongue. I just added a bit of black pepper powder and paprika in the mix, along with some mirepoix mix veggies. And it just got better. Toasted the breads on the skillet after the egg was done, so that's a good use of the buttery grease. With some blue cheese on the bread, turned out to be a satisfying meal on a weekday morning. :)","1614872006","5"
"115824811","johncarolina","I'm a fan of Kenji, I've been to chef school and cooked professionally (briefly), I respect the work of chefs, and I agree that if you haven't actually cooked this recipe just as he instructed you have no business criticizing it.  I just made this as instructed down to using potato starch and high-quality eggs from my own free-ranging Maran hens, and my opinion is that I would not make them again.  Just too heavy w butter for my taste, but they may be better on unbuttered toast or grits.","1638974808","5"
"111729750","Claire","This butter trick may be why cheesy scrambled eggs turn out so nicely (cheese added mid way, or early-ish). The same trick with the melting fat keeping parts cool.   On this basis, pre-grated cheese, which is bound often with potato starch, should work even better.","1614183338","4"
"111730593","Spatterson","Made the recipe exactly as written. Like many people, we are connoisseurs of perfect scrambled eggs so I couldn’t resist trying it. The amount of butter is too rich for me on a daily basis but these are definitely special weekend scrambled eggs! The texture and butter almost give the effect of the eggs being mixed with cheese. Wow!","1614185219","4"
"111777509","STLCooks","Made a double batch in seasoned cast iron skillet using tapioca starch slurried with milk. I used half the amount of butter, and they were great! What a delightful recipe, producing wonderfully tender eggs in a very short time. My young son, who despises quick-cooked scrambled eggs because of the texture, pronounced these ""very good"". What a cool technique - thanks for sharing, Kenji!","1614436150","4"
"111811477","Doug Barnert","Has anyone tried Arrowroot instead of Corn Starch. I use it for thickening my recipes.","1614650707","4"
"111857750","Jeff B","I just made this recipe and am eating the eggs now as I type this. Wow. I had believed that my scrambled egg game had no room for improvement, and I was wrong. I followed the recipe but cut down for 2 eggs, and only used 1 tbsp of cold butter cut into 1/4"" cubes per recipe. These eggs were the softest, fluffy and buttery, perfection. The addition of the corn starch was profound, I am converted to this technique.","1614868040","4"
"111882087","Barbara","We made this recipe last Sunday for ""Brunch"".  It was AMAZING!!! Moist and fluffy eggs without being runny or undercooked!  Love all the butter!","1614971023","4"
"112647327","Robyn","Prior to learning this clever technique of protecting the egg protein (from high heat) with a starch slurry, I did not really like scrambled eggs at all. And yes, I had made them the ways all the people discussing their supposed simpler alternative methods made them. What this ingenious recipe will make is something far more delicious and delicate that what you get with those other methods. It's not too much work- it's actually quite simple. Just give it a shot.","1619728273","4"
"113270359","RH31","I agree with others, don’t comment if you haven’t made it.  I appreciate the tip on ensuring the Pan is hot.  I made half the recipe and unfortunately, due to allergies, I needed to use earth balance instead of butter.  These are the best scrambled eggs I’ve made in 60 years. As a Girl Scout, I also made scrambled eggs at 7 yo, lol.","1623857977","4"
"115876220","Golem18","Because of the high protein content in eggs, they tend to stick to a regular pan.  With a nonstick pan, the eggs remain loose and released from the pan.  Even Julia Child kept a nonstick pan around just for eggs.  I've had good luck with Oxo nonstick.","1639241167","4"
"115902416","Beachwriter","It worked perfectly, and is perfectly simple. We don't like underdone eggs. These are just right and still soft. Per my 90 year old mom, who is dealing with dementia: ""Would eat here again."" :-)","1639425402","4"
"116204801","Chila Gent","Made these with olive oil instead of butter. Imparts a wonderful taste. Rather than the water try white wine in the pan. Then drink a few glasses of the wine. Forget the eggs. Use a chocolate chip cookie. Then drink the rest of the wine. Heaven.","1641342820","4"
"118917417","EM","If you can't imagine it, then try it.","1655902414","4"
"111729565","Kellie","I’ve done this with just hot water. Whisk eggs briskly, then right before cooking them, add just a splash of warm/hot water. They cook up fluffier. It’s an old diner trick.","1614182872","3"
"111731037","Frank","Use Jumbo.  Problem solved.","1614186357","3"
"111731229","Totaltully","Simple enough and rewarding for the effort. Different texture and feel, but fluffy and soft","1614186869","3"
"111734182","Rinshin","I made this for lunch today.  Almost foolproof very fluffy eggs very quickly.  We liked it, but, I still consider very small curd and super moist, my ideal scrambled eggs.  And that takes time.  This reminded me of Japanese tenshin eggs because of the texture and addition of potato starch.  It is always made with potato starch called katakuriko for fluffiness and rise in making round omlette very much like this texture.","1614197402","3"
"111850360","Judith","Made this today. It took about five minutes total, from slurry to sliding them out of the pan. It’s really very simple. I did cut the butter in half, thinking two tablespoons for two people was adequate. Verdict...absolutely delicious. I’m a convert. As soon as I drop these five confinement pounds, I’m going full out for the butter.","1614822930","3"
"115899589","Dennis D","I thought these eggs were spectacularly silky/creamy when cooked as written.  Most restaurants that I have been to do not make them this good.  And, the procedure was only two very small steps more than I would otherwise do.  This one's a keeper!","1639416108","3"
"116525567","Janey","Fantastic recipe for super creamy eggs! I usually go the low & slow route a la Samin Nosrat’s method and those always turns out with a lovely custard-esque texture & taste great but I tried this recipe today and the eggs were Delicious so this might be my new go to. For reference, it was just me so I just used 2 eggs, 1 tbs skim milk, 1 tbs cornstarch, salt, 1 1/2 pats of butter (1 for mixture & 1/2 for pan with the water).","1642959518","3"
"117248914","Carol","Worked great! For the scale-up nerds out there:  - 1/2 t cornstarch/egg dissolved in water at ratio of 3.75:1 - 1 T butter cubes/egg (w/about 1/2 T reserved for coating the pan before cooking)   Made an omelet w/pre-sautéed ingredients (ham cubes, spinach, mushrooms, green onions, mini bell peppers), some finely shredded cheddar cheese … added cheese just as eggs started to set, then folded in other goodies just as eggs looked nearly done). #Winner","1646597114","3"
"111732921","sue bastian","I tried it. I liked it. Fluffy but not gooey.","1614192273","2"
"111734802","Mark","I recently tried adding some creme fraiche to the eggs just as they were setting, decadent. I'm looking forward to trying this recipe","1614200212","2"
"111734875","Stacy","Using milk instead of water also makes the eggs creamier!","1614200587","2"
"111735325","Jane","I think it is a method to show that the pan is the perfect temperature.","1614203117","2"
"111921349","Mimi","I have been making delicious scrambled eggs for years and I agree with most of the advice in this recipe except one thing. No milk, cream, crème fraîche or even butter added to the eggs. I whisk in full fat sour cream. This makes for a deliciously fluffy scrambled egg with no chance of being watery or broken. Also, if you like a little cheese in your eggs, the sour cream binds to the cheese and the result is the flavor of the cheese without it separating from the egg.","1615238768","2"
"111987283","Lola","Made the first time with cornstarch - the second time with tapioca flour and both were a revelation.  The pockets of butter were delights.  I did end up cutting down the butter in subsequent makings and it was still outstanding.  Definitely recommend doing the water method for the skillet - it evenly heats up the pan so the eggs cook evenly.","1615585667","2"
"112000915","Sharon","This has become my go-to scrambled egg recipe! It comes together super fast and is so good! The taste is rich and buttery and the texture is like sunny yellow velvet!   If the extra step of cornstarch and chopped butter is too much trouble first thing I the morning, just prep the butter and make the slurry the night before. But honestly? It took less than 2 minutes for those extra steps and it is soooooo worth it! Thanks Kenji!","1615730077","2"

"112045542","LL","Amazing, decadent and easy to execute. For the sake of my arterial health I will try to limit to once a month, which will be quite the challenge.  As someone else has already noted, I finally understand why restaurant and hotel scrambled eggs are so addictive.","1615993650","2"
"112463061","Kristin","Just tried this recipe for the first time. The flavor is outstanding. Best scrambled eggs I’ve had, however the amount of butter left a greasy/filmy feeling in my mouth. I may try halfing the butter next time.","1618595221","2"

"115876360","CCKlyman","Been making scrambled eggs this way for years — perfect, foolproof scrambled eggs on the workweek breakfast table in about 2 minutes total. I do not add butter to the slurry— I use a tablespoon or less for the pan — but the more butter the creamier and more luscious the end product.  It’s chemistry folks.  The starch slows down the development of albumen, which is what Gordon Ramsay accomplishes by technique.  Don’t be tempted to increase the starch - a little does the trick.","1639242150","2"
"115876638","Mimi","Lovely! I had a nonstick pan at hand, so cut way back the amount for the pan (didn't skimp on what went into the eggs, however!). Stirred in 2 chopped scallions, reserving some for sprinkling on afterwards. Was skeptical of the small amount of salt, but it was just right—any more would have masked the subtle richness of the beautiful pasture-raised eggs that I used. I don't know why anybody would kvetch—prep time really was nothing, and the process of cooking is half the enjoyment of eating!","1639243943","2"
"115877248","joan","my problem with this recipe is that i dont want to eat 2T. of butter in my 2 eggs. the trade off of extra fat for creamier eggs is not one i'm willing to make more than once (to say i tried it).","1639247665","2"
"116135078","CYW","I thought I made pretty good scrambled eggs although I never got them as golden and fluffy as this technique does. These were ah-may-ZING! My only tweak was to add an extra egg. Served over bread, toasted with gruyere cheese and prosciutto, alongside a steamy latte. My teenage son LOVED them. Happy New Year!","1640890980","2"

"116217699","maggie","I made this as written and next time I will cut the butter in half. I found it a little heavy and far too greasy… delicious but greasy.","1641402622","2"
"116221469","Mary Beth","Maybe this is nice for supermarket eggs (I did make this), but not for local free range eggs, if you can get them. All of the butter and starch just blurs the taste of truly high quality eggs.","1641412598","2"
"116240254","Ash","Been making it this way for years except without adding any of the butter to the eggs or water to the pan.  Can't eat eggs any other way now!  I do let my butter brown a bit before adding the eggs--SO good, but kinda ugly.  I crack my eggs into a ball jar, then add salt and the cornstarch slurry, lid it and shake it up til frothy.  I pour it from the jar into the hot brown butter and go from there.","1641490642","2"

"118093201","Andrew","I've made these a few times, stuck to the recipe exactly as written.... These eggs are amazing! I added a thin layer of cheese right before they were done cooking, then wrapped in a soft tortilla, added hot sauce. Amazing breakfast!","1651332849","2"
