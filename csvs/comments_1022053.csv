"112333582","Lance","I have done this several times.  If you love labor, and practice it, the result is very good -- but never as good as Paris. Believe me, I have tried.  However, their is a faster recipe, and it takes less than 24 hr, most of it leisure time. Book a round-trip flight to Paris.  On arrival, take an Uber to Maison Pichard 88 Rue Cambronne.  Buy a dozen or more.  Eat several with a nice cafe.  Return to airport.  Enjoy the flight home. You will be home in under 24h with something truly wonderful.","1617818365","688"
"112336655","Frank","I made croissants (and all types of laminated doughs) professionally for about 40 years, and this is the best recipe I've ever seen for successfully making them yourself. All the proportions and instructions are completely accurate, and the methodology is well explained. If you do everything carefully, you will be very well rewarded.","1617830367","367"
"112320158","Kathleen","I sometimes wince when I see this kind of question appear, but I don't have a stand mixer with a dough hook.  I make a lot of breads and rolls, and I usually ignore the mixer instructions and just mix and knead by hand.  That's worked well in the past, but I'm concerned that the mixer might be important to this process.  Are there alternate instructions for hand mixing?  And yes, although perhaps not necessary, a video showing the rolling out and forming of the croissants would be delightful!","1617748155","156"
"112325651","Eibhlin","Like everyone in the past year, I woke up one morning and thought, ""If there was ever a time to learn to make croissants, this is it."" And, I did and they were incredible and I have earned much love and admiration because of it. I then moved onto bagels receiving similar accolades.  Whilst I was investigating the skill, I found a video which helped me immensely.  Here's the link:<a href=""https://www.cooksillustrated.com/videos/2143-croissants"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cooksillustrated.com/videos/2143-croissants</a> In May of 2020, it was free.  Go forth, brethen and bake:)","1617798089","118"
"112369183","i swag, i cook","Has anyone tried  adding a hot dog and a slice of American cheese during baking process? At what step is this done?","1618044403","47"
"112910827","Coltin R","The first day is very time intensive because of all the resting that needs to be done. I start around 9:30 and was done for the day around 3:30 to which you let it rest overnight. Day two all that needs to be done is cut/proof/bake. This all together takes 3-4 hours depending on how fast you can shape. So I would recommend starting before 1 on the first day and starting as early as you can on the second.","1621436680","44"
"112388798","pizzaslinger","I made these this weekend and think a turn (fold) is missing from the recipe.  I'm a professional baker for 25+ yrs.  I've made croissants for 1/2 my career, and have used professional grade equipment as well as hand rolled with a pin.  I've made croissants at home and in a restaurant.  I noticed there is only 1 book fold and 1 letter fold.  That's only 2 turns.  There should be 3.  I don't 1 book fold and 1 letter fold will give you the same# of layers.  Croissants had layers, but bready","1618235960","41"
"112322548","Pam Bend Oregon","For those who would like to see photos of the process go to King Arthur Flour’s website.   There is a blog post by Susan Reid attached to the recipe for Baker’s Croissants.  Bon Chance!","1617764056","35"
"115636903","Kristin","I did some research and figured out a solution that worked for me! On my third attempt I grated the chilled butter into the flour mixture before adding the milk and water. This allowed the butter to evenly disperse before adding the moisture and then was able to knead it into a smooth ball. Hope this helps!","1637766266","33"
"112339052","Sue","I'm also frustrated by NYT's frequent assumption that everyone has a stand mixer. Here, the key thing is that you need to develop strong, cohesive gluten without adding extra flour to achieve elasticity. You can do that with prolonged, vigorous hand-stirring (w/ a Danish dough whisk, if you have one), but probably best to avoid kneading & the temptation to add extra flour, unless you're comfortable handling slack doughs.","1617841288","32"
"116178842","Roberta","Made these at least 15 times in last year as a delicious anti-suicide tactic in an upside down world. 1. Watch Claire on YouTube *before* starting & research what “pliable butter” looks like. 2. Good temps for détrempe 50° & Butter 55°F (Unsalted Kerrygold, or President). 3. Put in fridge/freezer if dough gets warm, whether you’re finished the turn or not! 4. Proofing croissants may take FOUR TO SIX hours - wait for the puffy jiggle!","1641233908","32"
"112319988","Patricia Johns","This is a once a year event for me. I have used the Julia Child recipe. Note: some refrigerators and freezers are too small. I usually make these in the fall or winter so the overnight temperatures mimic the refrigerator. Finally, I am 72 years old and don't have a scale and make do with measuring.","1617747233","29"
"113022943","LM","I've never made croissants or any laminated pastry before, but I followed every step to the letter and it truly produced the most beautiful croissants I've ever seen.  It wasn't nearly as difficult as expected. All it takes is patience and precision, and trust in the recipe.","1622134751","28"
"112775145","Rosa","For folks who are asking for a video, there’s now one up on the NYT Cooking YouTube channel: <a href=""https://youtu.be/vpwY3nmLLaA"" target=""_blank"">https://youtu.be/vpwY3nmLLaA</a>","1620659396","24"
"114349353","Ashley P.","First time making croissants & followed this recipe to a T. Everything that could go wrong went wrong--I let the butter get too cold, then too warm, had it come oozing out of the sides, etc. But Claire's recipe is forgiving. At the end of the day they still tasted AMAZING and I even got the super flaky crunch. Would not change anything, and they'll only get better with more practice!","1630546048","24"
"115470627","Cookiefanatic","Don't throw away your cut-offs people! Use them up by cooking them in a waffle maker  They turn out absolutely delicious would definitely recommend.","1636788613","16"
"114600566","Melissa","Please check out the Awesome video that accompanies this recipe. One suggestion would be to FREEZE not refrigerate the crescents before baking. At least 20 min. I had some butter leakage after following this recipe strictly. The taste is amazing regardless.","1632083907","13"
"113878709","yum","Claire’s must have been enormous, because I made sixteen croissants with this recipe (ended up baking them for 21 minutes). Absolutely delicious!","1627611743","12"
"113066016","Scott C","3 phases: dough; laminate; wake & bake. Start ~9:00 AM day 1, finish about 2:00 PM day 2. Dough prep and mix is about an hour. Chill dough 6-ish hours; BUTTER BLOCK IMMEDIATELY. Laminate at 4:00- 5:00 PM-ish. 3-5 hours-ish on/ off work rolling freezing chill, rolling freezing chill, etc. It's 9:00- 10:00 PM. Sleep. Laminate chills 8-12 hours. Wake & Bake 4.5 hours. Optional finishing roll. Cut triangles, form croissants. 2.5 hours PROOF AT 75°. DO NOT OVERHEAT OVEN. Bake 35-ish minutes. Done.","1622498398","10"
"112882331","Devin Harold","I never leave comments on anything.  But...  These were absolutely decadent. Scrumptious. Profound. Perfection. They were flakey, layery, buttery rolls made from heaven. I had the pleasure of leveraging both the recipe written here as well as the recent NYT video.   To those without a stand mixer: it’s absolutely doable. My dough hook sucks so I did everything by hand and it didn’t take long at all. Happy baking!","1621302599","8"
"112324810","MaryKay Feely","I would benefit greatly from a video of the forming process.  I’m having difficulty visualizing the final steps in the shaping process.  The bagel video was exceptionally helpful in that process.","1617795008","6"
"112363192","Emily","I just made these yesterday, and they were delicious! It was my first time making croissants, but the specific instructions here made it feel doable. The results were 100 percent worth the effort. Try it!    For the person asking how this recipe varies from the Spelt Croissant recipe in Dessert Person, the 2 recipes seem pretty different to me. I have the cookbook but followed this NYT recipe because I didn’t have spelt flour (called for in the DP croissant recipe) on hand.","1617988763","6"
"116413328","DF","Have now made these three times.  Each time, they get more evenly-sized, and remain terrific.  Someone asked what to do with the little scraps, because, after taking all this trouble, it is a shame to waste any.    I rolled the scraps into a rectangle, sprinkled it with cinnamon sugar, rolled it up into a loose log.  Then, using dental floss, I cut one-inch thick tiny cinnamon rolls.  Baked at 375 F for twenty minutes, they were delightful with a schmear of cream cheese frosting.","1642357967","6"
"112367977","Leskap19","Ever since beginning to watch GBBO so many years ago, I have always wanted to make laminated dough.  I will try this recipe next weekend regardless, but a video of you making this recipe, would be greatly appreciated.","1618017880","5"
"112910869","Coltin R","Yes. In the youtube video she says that the ones she froze were one of her best batches however they will take upwards of 7 hours to proof. (Take out night before and wake up early)","1621436774","5"
"113169885","Chef Jimmy","First time attempting a project this large. Like other commenters, I realized my kitchen is probably a lot hotter than Claire's. If I try this again, I will need to chill the dough a lot more frequently.   For a beginner like me, this recipe along with the video was not that easy to follow, but not too complicated either. I don't like how the video doesn't give measurements making it a lot harder to use for reference.   I messed up a bit but they taste great. I'll try again in the winter!","1623188631","5"
"116353600","Liz","Made these for the first time this week, my first ever attempt at croissants. They turned out incredible! I also made them without a mixer, no problem. I grated the cold butter into the dry ingredients before adding the water and milk and mixed by hand until the dough came together. Then I let it rest for 10 minutes before turning the dough onto the counter and kneading for 15 minutes. It’s fairly low hydration and not at all sticky, a dream to work with! Followed all other steps exactly.","1642081551","5"
"123986558","Wendy","I have now made these twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and the result was eight beautiful, delicious croissants. My only complaint was that they were just too big. Even I, a croissant aficionado, couldn’t eat a whole one  at one sitting. So the second time I followed the recipe exactly until Step 16. Instead of rolling a 14x17 inch slab I rolled a 12x20 inch slab. The next day I  cut into 32 3x5” triangles. I baked 20 min turning 1/2 way. I had 32 delicious mini croissants!","1679678475","5"
"132055280","Marc","I do love the review from Lance 2 years ago. Just fly to France and get some croissants. I work In a major grocery chain. So my King Arthur is on sale, my plugra is on sale. I can make a batch for about $7. Lance’s idea is about $2000 in economy class.  Yes Europeans made it better. We just came back last week, but it’s real close and the recipe for frangipane is the best I’ve ever had.  I work nights and come home at 12am and bake, for hours. Croissants. Sourdough, cookies, scratch cakes","1711266102","5"
"112349024","Mingus","In step 5 you're roughly shaping the dough into an 8inch square and then in step 6 you're using the plastic wrap to ensure the dough is of an even thickness and create straight sides and angles","1617900153","4"
"115325820","Andie","I've tried this twice now and it's not working. My dough keeps coming out bumpy and not smooth like cauliflower even after i mixed with with the butter. I'm over this recipe sucks","1635980787","4"
"113212537","Lily","Doing the first rise (45-60 min at room temp) and dough has barely risen, if at all. I always always proof my yeast beforehand so was skeptical about this working? Should I keep waiting or call it quits?","1623441457","3"

"131117649","Lindsay","I never leave comments but I am so impressed with how these turned out. I rarely ever bake, but I really wanted to challenge myself with a new recipe. I had minimal hope with how they'd turn out, mainly because a lot of things went wrong throughout the process. My butter leaked out the sides, the dough peeled at some parts during rolling, and some of them proofed awkwardly. However, they ended up tasting and looking amazing. Don't let yourself get discouraged or too frustrated!!! 10/10","1707766910","3"
"113268798","Christopher Hall","I made these for the first time and a similar thing happened. I just carried on making the croissants to the end of the recipe and they tasted amazing and were no smaller than if they had risen more at the first rise.","1623853519","2"
"117110382","Sharon212","Question:  I'm in the middle of making these, and I've done my homework.   Can you tell me what the adjustments need to be for high altitude?  The dough is in the fridge, but doesn't seem to be rising the way it should.  I used  King Arthur bread flour and to get the first gathering, I had to add quite a bit more liquid. Added the butter, and it seemed smooth enough to let rise.  I'd rather throw this out (or bake it as something else) before I start to laminate.  I'm a seasoned cook.","1645843067","2"
"130048352","Sarah C.","This recipe is miraculous. I ate a bite with my eyes closed and was immediately transported to a café in Paris - so no need to fly there. Just follow the recipe as stated (I appreciated the reader tip to grate the butter in Step 2). I actually missed one of the freezer-to-fridge steps and they were still perfection. Thank you, Claire!!!","1703633315","2"
"130418027","PG Baking","I made these into “regular” sized croissants by cutting the final sheet in half to make 4x8 rectangles which would give you 16 croissants total, or you can do one sheet of 8 butter croissants and then cut the second sheet into approx 5.5x3.5 rectangles for pain au chocolat. Bake at 375 for 23-25 mins.  But most importantly - thank you Claire Saffitz!!! These were amazing and your recipes truly empower the home baker!","1705088174","2"
