"112757454","Quix36","Excellent. Only thing I would do differently next time is to cut the tomatoes in half. Roasting them whole, the little buggers exploded all over the inside of my oven.","1620490209","558"
"112717232","Shari Gresh","My grandmother had been cooking this kind of fish with coconut milk/turmeric 40-50 years ago since I was born. This is also a very common way to cook fish in southern Thailand. If the fish is a fresh catch, or whole, you can simply use this coconut/turmeric mixture to marinate or brush on fish for grilling. Less sauce but flavor will be absorbed. Serve golden grilled fish with spicy sea food dipping sauce made of fresh chilly/garlic/lime juice/sugar/a little fish sauce, and you'll be in heaven.","1620172005","454"
"112930505","Ben","For a leafy green side-dish without any extra clean up, add some spinach at the broiling phase. The leaves soak up all the wonderful marinade and tomato juices. Pairs well with crusty bread.   Delicious!!!","1621527523","384"
"112792990","adjustments","This was delicious as written! The only thing Iâ€™d do differently next time is to cook it in a smaller baking dish instead of a sheet pan. For me, the sauce burned a bit in the areas where it was spread thin. It was also difficult to spoon the sauce up from the sheet pan.","1620747573","308"
"112714658","Lynn","Question re sheet pans and roasting tomatoes...is the author of the recipe using aluminum pans which is not recommended?  I see this so often in recipes lately with the sheet pan craze.  Stainless steel pans are very expensive. Just wondering if there is some trick that can be done to mitigate any damage roasting acidic things on aluminum pans might do?","1620160917","268"
"124304514","Jenny","Thoughts I got from others:  * Delicious.   * Serve on fresh spinach, which will wilt (could also be roasted broccolini or other).  * Too sweet; less honey.   * Use all coconut milk; extra (milk w/ ginger, garlic, turmeric, etc.) is part of rice dish.   * Give tomatoes 5-12 minutesâ€™ head start.   * Halve tomatoes to avoid bursting on oven walls ðŸ˜¬.   * Roast cauliflower as a side.

"112757744","Juliet Jones","I was happy to see this instruction: ""1 (1-inch) piece fresh ginger, scrubbed and finely grated"". In the past, I've watched my sister in England use ginger and she never peeled it, whereas most recipes in the US call for peeling the ginger. No more peeling for me from now on!","1620492232","185"
"117271746","T","WOW!!! I have made several of the NYT'S fish preparations, and I have to say, this one is AMAZING! I used halibut, and let the cherry tomatoes get a head start with 10-12 mins in the oven before adding the fish. I did not cut them in half, and there wasn't any splatter. I also did not broil at the end, as my Le Crueset and casserole pans say not to broil or use high heat above 450. I don't like to use a sheet pan for things with sauce as it spreads, and  hard to get all the luscious sauce after.","1646715273","170"
"118351822","Mama Glik","This was outstanding and I used some of the milk mixture to make rice. I used the whole can of coconut milk and after I whisked in the ginger, garlic, turmeric etc., I put a cup of the milk mixture as half of the liquid for making basmati rice in a rice cooker.  Other half water.  Fabulous rice! I didnâ€™t have cilantro by the way and the dish was still amazing.","1652747856","164"
"112736199","bonnie","Excellent.  Made with thick cod fillet, took a little longer.  Used parchment paper, so skipped broiling and raised oven temperature to 500 and moved pan to bottom shelf for last few minutes.   Served with jasmine rice.","1620346224","106"
"112687281","maggie","Agree with Sheila. This is delicious.  Another great recipe from this author.  Appreciate the clear directions on baking and broiling.  We used halibut, and it was perfectly cooked.","1620053955","95"
"114098936","Sarah Coates","As a hesitant fish-eater, this was delicious! I used arctic char and served with spinach and brown rice. I followed the advice of others and used a glass baking dish instead of a sheet pan. I threw in some spinach with the tomatoes before broiling, but I think it worked just as well and was simpler to put fresh spinach underneath the fish when serving and the spinach wilts under the hot fish","1628988569","89"
"112735806","GaleC","I made this tonight using striped sea bass fillets and it was WONDERFUL! Served with brown rice and roasted broccoli. Heavy duty foil on sheet pan was easy clean-up. No need for that 3rd Tbsp oil on fish- plenty of moisture and fat from the coconut milk marinade. Watch closely when in the broiler, only needed about 4 minutes for beautiful browning and blistering of tomatoes. Thank you for another delicious fish recipe!","1620344088","80"
"112871721","corinnell","Loved this! Very easy, used striped bass and it was delicious. Personally, it was a little on the sweet side, so I would not use a whole tablespoon of honey next time. Maybe just one or two teaspoons, max.","1621265277","73"
"112756991","Susan","Regarding the aluminum sheet pan. I always put a silicone sheet on the pan (no burning mess on the pan either), which takes care of a multitude of issues. You could use parchment paper, too, but it might burn under the broiler.","1620487154","50"
"112679521","sheila","Followed the recipe as is, VERY good!","1620001536","29"
"117469924","Nate S.","If I made this again, I would lower the cook times substantially.  Maybe 5 minutes at 425, and then 4 minutes in the broiler.  You could remove the fish and keep the tomatoes cooking at that point, but the halibut was seriously overcooked following this recipe as written.  Really disappointing.","1647921404","24"
"126983475","max","I kind of hate it when people comment on these recipes but totally change them so they are unrecognizable... That being said, I made this the other night with marinated and grilled boneless chicken thighs rather than fish. Doubled the sauce because I wanted to use the whole can of coconut milk. Marinated the chicken for 4 hours with half the sauce and reserved the other half to spoon on later. Good times with pearl couscous and steamed broccoli!","1691937389","23"
"126799912","Jacaranda","Amazing with a late summer addition of fresh corn kernels cut from the cob, stirred through the sauce for the last 3-4 minutes of cooking - the literal and figurative pop of sweetness against the acid of the lime and tomato was incredible.","1691259663","21"
"126863301","Sally P","I used a coconut milk yogurt instead of coconut milk to make the sauce thicker and creamier. Came out great. I've made this twice, once with salmon and once with tilapia.","1691509924","18"
"114924805","Sharon","This just couldn't be yummier.  I usually give the tomatoes a bit of a head start in the oven, then add the fish & marinade and pop it back in the oven.","1633744424","15"
"112737912","Jane","Made with Tilapia filets- worked great!. Prepped a side of simple buttered orzo. Easy prep, easy cleanup, tasty dish.","1620357446","14"
"112754140","PRich","This is so delicious!!!! I used cod and will make this many times over. Everyone loved it. Some confusion about when to broil and when to move to lower rack. Great recipe.","1620443514","13"
"127219141","Eleanor","This is a total wow! I'll confess that I'm one of these people who looks at a recipe and changes it out of the gate, and if I don't, it's likely I'll amend it when I cook it again, but not this time. It's perfect. I did make a couple of small changes: I halved the recipe, since it was just two of us. I used ginger honey, because I had some. I reduced the sauce at the end. Fruity, balanced, delicious. Oh, I cooked the fish for 10 minutes in the oven, five minutes under the broiler.","1692802465","12"
"127101492","SarahT","This was super tasty, but using a sheet pan was very precarious. Next time I will use a baking pan with higher sides so the sauce doesnâ€™t spill over. Also, because I have peppers in huge amounts, I sliced up a jalapeÃ±o for the marinade. Yum!","1692317306","11"
"119076777","Marielle","I made this following the recipe without any changes in ingredients. It was so delicious and cooked perfectly! I used fresh snapper fillets. And took the advice of another cook who recommended cutting the tomatoes in half to avoid a tomato explosion in the oven. Thank you for that tip ! I adjusted the cooking time slightly to avoid overcooking the fish.  Thank you Yewande for this delicious recipe !!","1656636313","10"
"126994077","Meera","An amazing recipe. We used sablefish (black cod) and cooked it in a glass baking dish. Absolutely phenomenal. We followed another userâ€™s suggestion of using the excess coconut milk to cook jasmine rice, which worked out perfectly (we supplemented with water). My husband would have liked to add spinach before cooking but even without the spinach, we both loved it.","1691983193","9"
"118448003","nawal dt","You canâ€™t go wrong with this recipe. Itâ€™s a winner every time! You can also add veg to it. Iâ€™ve used cauliflower a few times and itâ€™s equally delicious.","1653293434","8"
"126999356","Tara","cooked with salmon, which needed more time, but was absolutely delicious.  Subbed basil for cilantro, since it's what I had.  Also used small tomatoes cut into quarters, which broiled really well and eliminated the splatter I've gotten from roasting cherry tomatoes.  My 9 year old ate it all with gusto -- always the highest compliement!","1692022639","8"
"127126815","Christine R","Wow -- this recipe has officially made it into our monthly rotation.  Excellent as is!  Next time I will use a smaller, non-aluminum dish to bake and roast it in as the coconut sauce burned in places on the sheet pan, making for difficult clean-up.  And, next time, I'll have a loaf of crusty bread on hand to soak up all that amazing sauce!  This dish deserves all five stars.","1692394921","6"
"131590386","foodaslove","After reading all the warnings about exploding tomatoes, I took a cocktail pick and made a single hole near the stem. Had no tommy bombs and all worked perfectly","1709500308","6"
"127469977","Liesel","No splatter tip!   1- Choose grape tomatoes and you can bake them whole. These tomatoes have a lower water content and meatier flesh, compared to cherry tomatoes. They get a lengthwise no-mess split. Cherry tomatoes pop and splatter due to the higher water content, thinner walls, and shape.   2- Cooking in a baking dish raises the sauce level around the tomato, which also helps.   I made the dish with salmon and Juliet grape roma tomatoes from my garden. I served it over jasmine rice.","1693718599","5"
"129594081","Kelly","Pro tip: if you can keep yourself from eating any leftover sauce with a spoon (good luck), toss it over leftover rice and stick in the fridge. The next day, use it to make fried rice with green onions, red bell pepper, pineapple, peas, raisins, cashews and shrimp.","1701890256","5"
"127327021","Karen T","I made this with halibut and it was delish!  Super easy and quick dinner.  Kids enjoyed it too.  Served with rice and some blistered snap peas.  Next time, I might cook tomatoes for abt 10 mins before adding fish as they couldâ€™ve used a bit more time roasting.","1693228184","4"
"127338874","Becky","You're arranging the oven racks so they are prepped for the baking/roasting - not adding a pan","1693251367","4"
"127370229","Kate","I made this tonight! It was so good. I made it with skinless salmon. I did start roasting tomatoes first for about 10 mins before adding the salmon and marinade. Then baked for 15 mins. I didnâ€™t have cilantro so I used Thai Basil that I am growing in my garden. I served it with coconut brown rice. I used the remaining coconut milk for the rice.","1693356202","4"
"126347338","alina","Do the fish and tomatoes in separate dishes","1689471119","3"
"126874294","Bklyn","What type oven has these settings? My oven has no settings like you describe.","1691530310","3"
"127160536","David B.","Great dish, easy to cook. Enjoyed the spinach addition. Agreed that it could've used the extra coconut milk for a little more sauce.","1692573237","3"
"127416136","Kimberly","Maybe the best fish Iâ€™ve ever made at home (not including Southern fried fish). The flavor profile was perfect. I also did a vegetarian version with tofu using the same recipe and it was also really good. Served with a side of braised kale. Donâ€™t worry about the coconut milk seeming too thick- it thins out in the cooking process.","1693502384","3"
"127479044","ExDC","I had fun with this. Used Pacific cod, not mentioned as an alternative but terrific, and added crimini mushrooms. They soaked up the sauce wonderfully.  The next day, having finished the fish but not the veg and sauce, I took several leftover anchovies out of the fridge, mashed them, added them to the veggies and heated it all up. Wonderful! This suggests that fish sauce might be a good addition to the dish as well, if you are using a whitefish. Not sure salmon would work with that variant.","1693774963","3"
"130820547","Christy","So good and easy. Based on others' comments, I just put the sauce in a Pyrex baking dish, added the fish and tomatoes, and baked it all together (I don't bother with the final broil). I make the full amount of sauce but less fish, and its nice to have the sauce for rice. After making this a couple times I stopped marinating in advance and there's no difference. (I've read that marinating does very little). I think this would work great with tofu instead of fish. Aleppo pepper is great in this.","1706643517","3"
"134834701","HettyF","I have now made this three times and I have come to a preparation that has worked best for me and is easiest: I halve the cherry tomatoes, and roast them on a baking sheet ahead of time separately for 12 minutes. Then I pack a glass pyrex dish with fresh spinach and drop the tomatoes on top. The fish (grouper) with sauce gets added on top of that and 20 minutes in the oven at 425 (no broiler) presents a perfectly cooked dish. I serve it with fresh sourdough baguette.","1721578077","3"
