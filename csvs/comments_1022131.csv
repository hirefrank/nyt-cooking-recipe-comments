"112676823","Shinstigator","Straight gochuchang is very thick and not usually served without thinning with other ingredients. Gochuchang is mixed with soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, sugar and minced garlic to make the sauce that is mixed into bibimbap. Just google bibimbap gochuchang sauce. Or more simply, just mix with water and sesame oil.","1619971555","682"
"112736171","Dustin","For the gochuchang, you want to make a sauce (don't use the straight paste!):  2 to 3 tablespoons gochujang paste 1½ tablespoons rice vinegar 1 tablespoon sesame oil 1 tablespoon maple syrup  You can also add a splash of soy sauce.","1620346058","541"
"112774224","Judy","I like to press cold, cooked rice into a large, very hot cast iron skillet that’s been coated with sesame oil; I turn the heat down and allow it to crisp, evenly divide and place in heated bowls, then fry the eggs in the same skillet.","1620656258","258"
"112662844","Prakash Nadkarni","@Euphemia: To add to my previous note: Traditionally, the crisp rice layer is produced by placing the rice in a fairly heavy and very hot (e.g., oven-heated) stone/ceramic serving bowl, pressing the rice down to ensure good thermal contact. The bowl, whose material has high specific heat, yields its heat to the rice layer sustainedly.  This technique requires some care by both the cook and the diner not to burn themselves: the low-slow method, used in Iranian chelo rice, avoids this risk.","1619829300","114"
"112677162","mimi","This is a really interesting recipe! In response to another comment pointing out how the browned, crusty rice in bibimbap is made, transitional Korean cooking doesn’t use oven. It’s all done on a stove top, in a thick stone pot for that delicious browned rice on the bottom - called nooroongji. I grew up in Korea and I didn’t start using my oven regularly years into moving to US. But this recipe seems brilliant. I’m all for seeing recipes that mix different cuisines and techniques.","1619974070","90"
"112662581","Prakash Nadkarni","@Euphemia - You're right that a quick steam (or microwaving) would separate the clumps of leftover rice into separate grains. But Step 3's heating the resultant rice in a sheet pan for 3-6 minutes to set the egg whites would not produce crisp rice crust, if that's your intention. Crust formation, a combination of caramelization (mostly) plus Maillard reaction, requires slow (20 min+) and low (3/10 on an electric stovetop) heat using a non-stick or oiled/buttered pan.","1619827021","76"
"112677569","Kitchen Princess","Eggs cooked on a sheet pan are actually really good. I add the egg(s) for the last 5 min or so of roasting. The pan is already hot so it doesn’t run and the quality of the sheet pan cooked egg is superb because of the heat on both sides. The best, honestly. Just test the cooking time obviously, learn your oven for this. Mine would probably eviscerate kale at 450 for that long , on topic of oven varieties LOL","1619978171","62"
"113400234","Ann","This is now my new favorite clean out the fridge meal! A sweet potato, a handful of kale, a quarter cabbage, some aging carrots, and a zucchini. Fried some tofu cubes, too. Made Maangchi's ""vinegared soy-hot pepper paste seasoning sauce"". Crisping the rice was a huge favorite - made a big pot of brown rice in the pressure cooker then spread it out immediately on a hot sheet pan where it crisped wonderfully. Served with kimchi and cucumbers and some shredded raw cabbage with lime & gochugaru.","1624740889","55"
"112689079","Susan","Although not traditional, this sounds interesting.  Having said that, I'd point out that bibimbap is mixed with gochujang sauce, not straight up gochujang.  Gochujang sauce has mixture of sugar,  garlic, vinegar and for me, mirin.  If you don't want to make it, you can purchase ready made bibimbap sauce pretty easily at Korean supermarkets.  Just keep it in the fridge like ketchup and whenever you like, add it to a bowl of rice.  Even with just a fried egg and sesame oil, it's pretty good.","1620057995","53"
"112873776","RM","Re: straight gochujang vs. gochujang sauce. This is a matter of preference and there's not one more ""authentic"" way than the other. Half of my Korean family prefers the sauce and the other half will always opt for straight gochujang. Of course, if you want to go with simple gochujang, it helps to have smooth home-made gochujang instead of the BRICK that I've had in my fridge forever.","1621271017","44"
"112670490","Lynn D.","Eggs are protein","1619913907","42"
"112697075","KCL","Next time I would double the veggies and use both sheet pans for cooking them if I want four servings. Then I can avoid cooking the rice and eggs in a sheet pan and just crisp the rice in a heated cast iron and quickly fry the eggs in a nonstick pan instead.   Also making the gochujang sauce someone else recommended was definitely worth it over thick paste form.","1620085291","36"
"113906696","radishriot","I would think that we should probably trust the Korean on the straight up gochujang add. Most traditional Korean restaurants serve it straight up on the side. The recipe is delicious as is. Thank you Eric. <3","1627786888","29"
"112679625","Laura Savini","We loved this but we certainly did not have crispy rice. For my oven, next time I will cook the rice longer and put the eggs in for just two or three minutes.  The eggs cooked much faster than the rice warmed/crisped.","1620002174","28"
"112675980","Prakash Nadkarni","RE: protein -- mykoreankitchen.com/bibimbap-korean-mixed-rice-with-meat-and-assorted-vegetables/ uses ground beef (25-30g/person, you can  increase it). The basic Korean flavor combination of soy sauce, sesame (both oil and seeds), sugar and garlic in the recipe works for any meat or even firm tofu; just cut the meat thinly so that it cooks quickly.","1619967371","26"
"112861415","Meagan","I lived in Korea for 3 years and they absolutely make bibimbap with straight gochujang. It's mixed evenly with the rice and vegetables so that it's not too overpowering. Although, I'm guessing I can handle more heat than the average American.","1621191966","19"
"113400077","barbara","NYT highly recommends this video of Eric making the recipe: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB5voELYrAU"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nB5voELYrAU</a>","1624739885","13"
"112676775","Sunny","I usually leave leftover rice in the rice cooker for a day or so. Room temperature rice is very workable and palatable. If there are any leftovers after that then they get tossed in the fridge.  If we want to eat refrigerated rice, we usually drizzle some water over it and microwave for a couple minutes.","1619971248","12"
"112707825","Janet H.","Looked at comments from those who made the recipe, and consulted with the korean cooks that I know.  None of them heard of crispy rice in bibimbap, but they all could see the advantages of using dry heat to reheat cooked rice and keep if from becoming a soggy starchy mess.  Took the advice of one and thinned the gojuchang with the recommended ingredients (thanks!).  This recipe is not supposed to be photo-shoot quality, and that is both its charm and its flavor.  Recommend follow it as written.","1620139560","12"
"113444971","jackie","Had to use 2 sheet pans to fit all the veggies without crowding.. also, even though I sliced everything thin, actual cook time was about 45 min for the sweet potatoes/onions/mushrooms. The kale was ready at the 25 minute mark. I thinly sliced some ribeye and tossed it in a marinade of soy sauce, sesame oil, salt, pepper, ginger, garlic and put that on yet another pan (also ready at 25 min mark). I mixed the gochujang with sesame oil, rice vinegar, and a little bit of water as suggested.","1625019759","12"
"112761726","Sleestak","This is fantastic, much more than the sum of its parts, and works as written. Straight-up gochujang works fine, too. No need to create extra work as suggested by some of the other commenters.","1620522589","10"
"112756928","Sarah P","Another banger from Eric Kim who is rapidly becoming one of my favorite recipe creators. We made exactly as written (except with brown rice) and found this fish to be filling, flavorful, and comforting. It was so easy to prepare, it will be a repeater in our kitchen!","1620486732","7"
"120056384","KA","Really tasty! Some tips: 1. More mushrooms. 2. Cook the sweet potatoes, mushrooms, onion on one large pan, the kale on a second pan. Don’t do the kale for 20-25 min at 450 unless you want to set off the smoke alarm (been there, done that). Once you take the kale out, re-use that pan for the rice (precooked in a rice cooker) and eggs. 3. Don’t stress about the gochujang comments. I was able to find this pretty easily at the grocery store in a paste & it was delicious as is.","1661397633","7"
"115489895","JJ","Do not try cooking kale for any longer than about 6 or 7 minutes at 450. If you cook it for anywhere close to as long as this recipe suggests it will either burst into flames or you will have small pieces of black carbon based matter that was once kale.","1636937765","6"
"117653733","anne13","The brilliance of this recipe is how simple it is. Sure, you can use multiple pans and make your own gochujang sauce—have at it! But you can also put together a very good bibimbap with a few handfuls of vegetables and some leftover rice on a night when you have no energy for cooking or cleanup. I’ve made it three times this week :-)","1648843047","6"
"113559337","malahat","Good flavors! But the procedures described in this recipe are problematic.   — Don’t slice the sweet potatoes and onions too thin. They’ll cremate in a 450 oven at 20 minutes.   — I thought the “crunchy bits” in the baked leftover rice were unpleasant bits of burnt stuff. Next time, I’ll just mix in cooked rice.   — Watch the baking eggs carefully; they’ll overcook in a second. Really, that procedure is pointless; just fry the eggs on the stovetop.","1625712902","5"
"113853093","Amanda","Tried this out recently and thought it was delicious! I swapped out the kale and sweet potato for broccoli and zucchini--I'll probably try out the original combination once it gets into the fall and winter. (Like the head note says, I imagine this is probably great with any vegetable that's good roasted--might be a good way to use up the oddballs in your CSA box.)","1627485819","5"
"113300073","Debra","Brilliant idea to crisp cooked rice on sheet pan! Made a large platter to bring to a friends’ who needed a vegetarian option for a party. Roasted the kale but sauteed the mushrooms and cubes of firm tofu. I also par-cooked the sweet potato before slicing into half moons and roasted those. To give the veggies and tofu more flavor, I made a Korean-style sauce of soy sauce, sesame oil, mirin, and sliced green onion and drizzled on. Also, made omelet and sliced into strips along with strips of gim.","1624028260","4"
"114240414","Yoonkeun","I've found that the kale on the sheet pan of vegetables tends to go burnt if I'm not careful, so I've placed kale on the side closer to the door of the oven to keep a closer eye on it and so that it drops the temperature near the door to decrease likelihood of burning it. Cheers!","1629930014","4"
"130611844","fc","This recipe is awesome, an easy way to get a large portion of fresh vegetables into one meal. And tasty without needing a lot of extra ingredients. So many people in NYT comments get hung up on traditional methods and need to relax. Think about all the other dishes you like to cook that have traditional and shortcut methods. And if your gochujang is too thick just mix it with a little hot water.","1705880392","4"
"113589605","HSK","Add kale after other vegetables/ less cooking time","1625862300","3"
"130468424","Maria R","This has become my go-to meal.  I make it regularly for dinner, because so many veggies (!) and just enough meat.  Had friends here for a birthday weekend, and made it the first night they were here.  When trying to decide what to make on the second night, they requested this again.  Their pronouncement was “restaurant quality”. I used kale, carrots, mushrooms, peppers, bok choy, winter squash (IMHO the more variety the better!) and chicken marinated in soy sauce and sesame oil. Gorgeous!","1705356186","3"
"130661203","Megan","My family and I loved this.  I would make two sweet potatoes, as one wasn't enough for four servings.  The eggs were overcooked, and I'll make them on the stove top the next time I make this. I also followed the previous comments and made this classic gochujang bibimbap sauce (easy on the sugar) for the top. <a href=""https://mykoreankitchen.com/bibimbap-sauce"" target=""_blank"">https://mykoreankitchen.com/bibimbap-sauce</a>/","1706066760","3"
"134008632","TheBiggestHater","If you can cook kale at the recommended temperature for the recommended amount of time and have it edible when it comes out, you might be a saint because that is a miracle. Horrible timings on this - mushrooms were overdone, kale was basically carbon. Heed my warning: Use your own judgement when making this and do not follow the recipe exactly.","1718828884","3"
"123920544","Kristy","Used red cabbage thinly sliced and rainbow chard. Cooked stems of chard first, then sliced leaves thinly and cooked while eggs were cooking. Also spread rice on parchment paper with a little oil. Irresistible crunchy pieces of rice !  I used the sweet potato and mushrooms as well. Such a delicious, versatile and easy dish.","1679437807","2"
"136131019","Bridget M","Such low effort for such a delicious result. I HIGHLY recommend making this sauce to drizzle on top (from My Korean Kitchen) for optimal results:  1/2 cup gochujang (Korean chili paste) 1/4 cup toasted sesame oil 1/4 cup sugar 1/4 cup water 1/4 cup toasted sesame seeds 4 tsp vinegar, apple cider vinegar or rice vinegar 4 tsp minced garlic  Thank me later!","1726150297","2"
