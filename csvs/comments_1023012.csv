"117245307","Ian from Salt Spring Island, BC Canada","I’ve been using my meat tenderizing mallet for smashing garlic lately. Turns it into a creamy paste. Does a great job and I’ll use it with this recipe.","1646583385","1535"
"117260951","Eileen","I keep a large bulb of garlic, roots intact, in a small vase (one that held a hyacinth bulb purchased at Aldi works well). Use the tall green shoots from the garlic instead of scallions to add flavor and greenery to any number of dishes. The roots that grow swirl in a lovely pattern in the bottom of the vase, and the bulb will continue to produce shoots for weeks.","1646670436","1203"
"117270884","Gigi","As a Vietnamese immigrant whose parents owned a restaurant for decades in Denver, I would like to add another essential condiment/sauce in the canon of Vietnamese cooking called Maggi. My family makes this dish using Maggi and not fish sauce. Just thought I'd offer this up as another way to make these yummy noodles. Maggi, in its iconic curvaceous dark brown bottle, is not made of soy but wheat protein. You will often that tangy saltiness in Vietnamese sandwiches.","1646706736","1171"
"117231692","Patrick","YiaYia, a mortar and pestle crushes the garlic, releasing its flavors and oils, but a food processor just cuts it up finely, and the hard sides of the garlic are still intact, albeit smaller.  But, little of the garlic’s flavor is released when it is simply cut into small pieces, so if you don’t have a mortar and pestle, it’s better to crush the garlic with the flat side of a heavy knife, and then mince it.","1646490223","843"
"117230973","RobinP","Have been cooking pasta in a skillet for years. Use approximately 3 cups of water per 12 oz of pasta in 12-inch skillet. Turn heat to high. Cook approximately 10 minutes, stirring frequently, adding more water towards end if needed as noodles absorb the water and soften. Add favorite sauce - or transfer as recommended in this recipe and toss till you are happy with the finish.","1646484956","546"
"117256766","James F","Hamish,  Folks have tested this plenty of times - there's basic science to it.  Here's one article from a colleague of Kenji's: <a href=""https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-mince-chop-garlic-microplane-vs-garlic-press"" target=""_blank"">https://www.seriouseats.com/how-to-mince-chop-garlic-microplane-vs-garlic-press</a> That said, we cook for our homes, not a lab. Process the garlic any which way you want.  The important thing is someone wanting to cook.","1646655882","470"
"117265110","Jacques B","DO not buy crushed garlic in a jar. You can get away with whole peeled garlic in a crunch. Garlic is easy to use peel a few bulbs and leave it whole in your fridge and then you will have the pleasure of using garlic in your cereal in the morning.(just to see if anyone is reading)","1646681670","369"
"117253052","michelle","Unusual for me, completely followed the recipe, no changes. I'll never cook pasta in a pot again.Added a fair amount of the pasta water, to the end product and tasted like we had a cream sauce. This is amazing, no leftovers ...and chop the garlic however you want!","1646618009","342"
"117243900","CFXK","1. On a well supported cutting board, smash garlic cloves with the flat side of a chef's knife - making sure to: hold the handle of the knife over the edge of the board; center the blade over the garlic (lest you send the clove flying across the kitchen); and give the side of the blade a nice hard whack. 2.  Gather smashed cloves into what will look almost like a pile of pulp, and mince away.  Easy; fast; efficient - and a great way to channel aggression.","1646578555","278"
"117267432","Lena","I have made this dish dozens of times over the last few years and it's always delicious. I do have a suggestion, however. The amount of sauce needs to be at least doubled from what is suggested above. Keep the butter and garlic on a very low flame so the garlic doesn't burn. Turn the heat off before adding the cheese.","1646689410","228"
"117263035","Brad","I found a garlic ""rocker"" on Amazon while browsing kitchen utensils. I's a bent bar shape with small holes in the center. You press down and rock back and forth on a garlic clove and it pushes the garlic through the holes, releasing the most intense garlic flavor. It's much like a press, but without the messy clean up and frustration of getting all the garlic out of the press. It cleans up in about 15 seconds. I'll never mince garlic again!","1646675908","219"
"117229699","MenloPaul","I think there is also a little tangerine juice to counter the garlic, as in their sumptuous roast crabs...","1646458191","196"
"117237384","Betsy","Fresh is surely better, but those little jars of minced garlic really do make life easier.","1646519732","193"
"117232598","MichaelH","There are lots of vegan fish sauces and oyster sauces available, and they taste great.    I live in Northern Virginia, so I get them from H Mart, but you can also find online.  The vegan oyster sauce I prefer is Kikkoman.   ps I just checked the bottle and it says vegetarian, not vegan - but I don't see anything in the ingredient list that's non-vegan.","1646494838","174"
"117248934","laurie","1- Trust and follow the pasta cooking method - but stir to unstick from pan   2- Use all the garlic even if it seems like too much  3- Add a bit more of each of the sauces, and more like 1/2 c. cheese   I ended up not even needing to drain the pasta, end result was perfectly creamy/emulsified, not greasy in the slightest. I told my Roman-born husband it was like Vietnamese carbonara. We added lots of black pepper (like the crab dish has). Anyone tried it w/ bottarga instead of cheese?","1646597196","141"
"117245018","Phaniecoop","I’ve been messing around trying to replicate this recipe for over thirty years, with pretty decent results. I use some Maggi seasoning, with or without soy sauce. And I almost always throw in a bit of mayonnaise.  Love the suggestion for a touch of tangerine juice.","1646582349","76"
"117232694","Hamish","The only reason to not use a food processor is the cleanup hassle.  People will forever repeat (the untested mantra) that a mortar and pestle does miraculous things that a knife or food processor can't do, but given how this is cooked, there's no way a side-by-side blind comparison would ever detect a difference.","1646495206","75"
"117245163","David Hard","I add a about a tablespoon (basically a big pinch with my fingers) of flour to my garlic. Makes it a little bit more of a paste, and the sauce is a little drier and thicker, making it more like the garlic noodles I love getting from various places in San Francisco. Cook up some shrimp and add them in along with a bit of sriracha. Yum.","1646582888","67"
"117241381","jafitts","A garlic press might work as well, but as it can be a pain to clean, I'd probably use a chef's knife: Smash with side of knife, mince, use side of knife to mash minced bits. (Jacques Pepin is always doing this with garlic; you might be able to find a demonstration by him online.)","1646554833","56"
"117247624","SalD","When you cook pasta in shallow water, do you add salt?  Nobody mentions it.","1646591577","53"
"117260745","Monique","I do the same. I put the garlic between small pieces of parchment or waxed paper to keep the all the bits and for easy clean up.","1646669833","51"
"122036469","Michael Edwards","I like to gently massage the garlic cloves first, with some soothing ambient music in the background. This results in a mellower flavor. I also make my own oyster sauce, using bivalves that I raise myself in a saltwater aquarium in my basement. And it goes without saying that Brown Cow Parmigiano Reggiano is a must for this recipe. Delish!","1671141371","48"
"117267655","Lynn","Substitute for oyster sauce…hoisin sauce Sub for fish sauce….soy sauce","1646690500","47"
"117231901","Julia","If you have a small sized processor, go for it. If you only have a full sized unit, then its probably not quite enough garlic, and it will fly out to the sides of the bowl and not get evenly chopped or chopped small enough. I usually grate my garlic on a microplane.","1646491321","46"
"117251532","Linda","This is pretty good.  I added 2 cups frozen peas and 1 1/2 cup of shredded roast chicken which made it a main course.","1646610098","41"
"117344272","Squirrel Butler","I used 21.  It was just one clove too many.  20 is the bomb","1647101613","40"
"122040137","Eric","In Kenji's book (The Wok) he says the garlic should weigh about 60-70 grams.","1671154832","40"
"117251849","KPS","@Hamish - I've had pesto made with a mortar and pestle and pesto made with a food processor.  There is a world of difference in texture, creaminess and taste ~ its so much better when ground by hand.","1646611609","36"
"117249793","Jane Eyrehead","I agree with mashing the garlic with the flat side of a knife. Ever since the Galloping Gourmet did it, I have never looked back.","1646601462","35"
"117284640","Jill Turner","Pasta is absolutely delicious. Made tonight. Added salt to the pasta water, and next time I won’t. Might be nice to add that note to the instructions as most cooks are trained that pasta water needs salt. Had a few problems with the Parmesan clumping on the serving utensils. Might be interesting to add a Parmesan rind to the pasta water and then omit the Parmesan shavings.","1646787736","34"
"117262760","cynthia","Delicious simple tasty recipe. Added extra soy sauce. Cooking noodles in a flat pan makes a huge difference both for the noodles and that leftover starchy water. Do not salt pasta water! Would be great cooking egg into it last minute too. Will make many times. Thanks Kenji!","1646675211","28"
"117251331","Barbara","I wonder if could the frozen garlic puree from Trader Joe's be used? 1 cube = 1 clove","1646609059","26"
"117274546","Sandra","Made this exactly following the recipe. Delicious. Garlicky but not overly sharp. We had some leftover, so I put a bit of the pasta water in the container with the noodles to keep them moist.","1646750433","25"
"117334353","Natasha","I wish the NYT and other recipe sites would talk about garlic as the wildly different substance it is depending on variety, freshness, and where it's grown - or if you're using garlic from an actual head of garlic instead of  peeled sold in a bag/jar. A recipe calling for 20 cloves should really have some notes about adjusting based on what garlic you're using. Notes here talk about too much garlic flavour, or not enough. 20 cloves of one garlic or another will make a huge difference","1647025578","24"
"117345275","LInda","This was delicious. I would only request a weight for the garlic. With most recipes, if I misjudge a particular size of a clove or 2 of garlic, it won't make much difference. With 20 cloves, it can absolutely make a difference! This may have been the first thing I ever made where I actually thought I had too much garlic in it. I didn't know that was possible.","1647105255","24"
"121900176","Chris C","I have a wonderful fist sized beach rock with a flat side that I use when crushing multiple cloves of garlic. Much faster than my chefs knife and it gives me pleasure using it as well as seeing it on my counter.","1670475646","24"
"117239224","denisem","I've used Yondu vegan fish sauce (not in this recipe, not yet) and like it very much. You can get it online but I found mine at a health food store.","1646529998","21"
"117261070","Bill","Pecorino Romano or Parmesan? Really different flavor profiles. Given the very large amount of sodium in the liquid ingredients, stick to the less salty Parmesan. Better yet, use Grana Padano, which is a delicious, less-salty and more economical grating cheese.","1646670778","20"
"117276724","Ed Mocarski","We have prepared this dish for years using soy sauce together with Maggi sauce rather than fish sauce or oyster sauce and leave out the Parmesan.  With the garlic smashed, mashed, chopped or crushed, it always comes out delectable (and totally vegan).","1646757734","20"
"117245472","Drew F.","@cary, Maggi closely matches the flavor profile of a ‘light soy sauce,’ despite not being made of soy, and would work great. My Vietnamese mother has always had a soft spot for Maggi.","1646583926","19"
"117561297","Doodles","Whatever happened to the garlic press? I’ve had mine now for 50(?) years. First kitchen gadget I ever bought. Still think it’s the best way to smash garlic.","1648475683","19"
"117302522","Barbara","Delicious, talk about umami! This is ambrosia for garlic & pasta lovers. I used a fair amount of the pasta (capellini) cooking water. I salted the pasta water but will reduce or eliminate salt next time given the amount needed & the saltiness of the sauce ingredients. Also added some leftover sautéed spinach. We will make this again (& again!).","1646871349","17"
"120520936","Matt","Use a plastic sandwich bag and rubber mallet; when done smashing them, turn bag inside out and drop garlic into sauce.","1663774925","16"
"118540258","Michele","Against my better judgment, and thinking what do I know anyway and that K L-A is the expert (enjoy his book btw). . . I followed the recipe and used a ""skillet"" to cook the noodles. Pro tip -- Don't use an iron skillet! Yuck, noodles taste like iron. I can't get the taste out of my mouth! Iron noodles!","1653697861","15"
"117265202","Chantal","Most chefs suggest using Lee Kum Kee Vegetarian Stir-Fry Sauce as a substitute for oyster sauce.","1646681969","14"
"121963815","Laurie","I made this recipe once by mincing the garlic with a knife, and another time by smashing it in a mortar and pestle. Using a mortar and pestle is an absolute must, the garlic becomes creamier and less harsh, making for a much more cohesive sauce. This recipe is in my opinion wonderful with the smashed garlic but underwhelming with knife-minced garlic.","1670870214","13"
"117231913","isuredbird98","Any suggestions for veganizing this vis-a-vis the fish/seafood sauces? Thx.","1646491387","12"
"117243229","Cary","I have a similar excellent, easy recipe that uses Maggie seasoning instead of soy sauce. Consider the swap.","1646575648","11"
"117361123","Mr.","Delightful. Told my kids it was Vietnamese garlic and oil. No cheese for me but the kids went for it. Would like a bit of heat next time add a teaspoon of chili flake or a fresh chili. Definitely a keeper.","1647221565","11"
"117261614","Bob","Use a garlic press -- releases the powerful flavor and cooks beautifully.   Already been said, but more water necessary to make the noodles...","1646672359","10"
"117770022","Jess","Then you had better skip this recipe, because parmesan is full of MSG.    Really though, please give this article a read: <a href=""https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-msg-got-a-bad-rap-flawed-science-and-xenophobia"" target=""_blank"">https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-msg-got-a-bad-rap-flawed-science-and-xenophobia</a>/   Happy cooking!","1649521848","10"
"127653026","Jean A","20 cloves of garlic? For that many, recipe writers need to get with the fact that people with access to a farmer's market or home garden are using hard-neck garlic a lot these days. The cloves of a hard-neck can be four times larger than the soft-neck garlic which is sold in grocery stores. When using one or two cloves, it's easy to estimate an adjustment, but with 20, a person could go very wrong! Instead of 20 cloves, how about an approximate weight?","1694457232","10"
"117265587","JJ","I love garlic any time of the day or night.","1646683061","9"
"117267755","ZFMT","I was going to say this too! Why would anyone not use a microplane?Though twenty is a lot for that method, it's a true. A great trick for getting garlic smell off fingers is to rub them on anything made of stainless steel under running water. I use the metal handle of my microplane--magic!","1646690933","9"
"117268932","Sally","I used the trusty food processor to mince the garlic in about 6 seconds. Believe me, the power of the garlic was not diminished because it wasn’t crushed. I find it sautés better cubed than crushed - far less browning and burned bits and it doesn’t clump. Just my option but if you don’t feel like mincing 20 cloves don’t feel that your final product will suffer for it.","1646695980","9"
"117333166","JZ","This recipe didn't work for us. It may have been better without the cheese, which seemed discordant here.","1647022218","9"
"121912990","Carla","The author of this article suggests adding raw shell-on shrimp at the beginning of the cooking process. WHY shell-on? I find nothing quite as annoying as having to plunge my hands into a beautifully cooked dish to remove shrimp shells. It destroys the dish, my hands, and any pleasure that might come from eating the shrimp. Food preparation should result in something that can be eaten and enjoyed with a modicum of fuss. Shell-on shrimp mixed with noodles, garlic, butter and cheese is not that.","1670599447","9"
"117240397","Lin","You can use your zester or a microplane to get minced garlic by grating it. Picked this idea up from Rachel Ray (daytime talk/cooking show host).","1646537831","8"
"117358409","Diana Jacobs","Made this last night  - was a hit!  I used two tweaks I discovered on YouTube for this dish: 1. Bucatini noodles are thicker and have a great chewy mouth feel 2.  Added a ladle-full of pasta water to the minced garlic in the wok to parboil it a bit, and boiled it away.  Then added the butter, and finally the sauces.  This tamps down the garlic bite  - I love garlic, but too much garlic doesn't love me","1647202312","8"
"122449581","Mic","Honestly I don't get all the garlic talk. Either you like it or you don't. Either you have a preferred way of preparing it or not. If garlic isn't your thing, maybe not make this recipe. Just saying. I am always recalculating recipes to serve two, so I used ten cloves of garlic. Perfect for our taste. We visited Thanh Long in SF for the roast crab. Now I'm sorry I didn't pay more attention to the noodles! This recipe is a winner!","1673271221","8"
"126135669","Anna P","Made this, love it. Regarding the garlic prep, I quickly and easily got all 20 cloves pulverised in a mini food processor. This dish was a big hit with my college kids and the next morning we pan fried the leftovers with eggs for a good, savory breakfast.","1688606299","8"
"117271179","Hannah F","I cooked it with a few adjustments and would change somethings if I make it again. I smashed the garlic then minced it. Got great garlic flavor. I added about 1 tbs of minced, fresh ginger. I added 1 tsp brown sugar and 2 tsp sambal too. It tasted like it was missing something so I added a few splashes of mirin at the end. I will add double the sauce ingredients (except garlic/ginger) next time and make less pasta as the overwhelming flavor was garlic. It was imbalanced— it was begging for acid.","1646708828","7"
"117316337","kelsey","I didn’t have oyster sauce so I doubled the fish sauce and soy sauce and still tasted like I remember in SF! Purchased pre-peeled garlic cloves to save time.","1646942317","7"
"117334098","Veej","The next time I make this I will add just a touch of cayenne of red pepper flakes.  I put the peeled garlic cloves between sheets of plastic wrap and mashed them with a meat tenderizer.","1647024835","7"
"117334569","Sabine Flury","Delicious...but adding parmesan cheese is too fusion for my taste.","1647026182","7"
"122350306","Cheryl","I've made this twice now, and I wouldn’t change the ingredients or the technique except for one thing: grabbing the slippery pasta with tongs is ridiculous. Next time I make it (probably tonight) I'll drain the pasta with a pitcher under the sieve to catch the pasta water. The pasta goes all straight into the sauce, and the pasta water is easily poured into the pan as needed.","1672784122","7"
"124965804","Melinda in SF","It seemed too easy to be true.  Spaghetti?  Is that authentic?  And it's so specific-- San Francisco Style Vietnamese American Garlic Noodles.  I had doubts.  BUT, since I live in SF, and we were having crab for a New Years Dinner, I made this, and even though it took a grand total of 15 minutes to make (isn't good cooking supposed to be time consuming?), it was perfect.  Just perfect.  I have followed the career of Lopez-Alt for some time, and he is amazing.  Whatever he says, I'll make!!","1683647627","7"
"129682466","Alice","I've been roasting garlic bulbs (wrapped in foil with a teaspoon or so of olive oil) when using the oven - as long as I'm not baking a cake.   To substitute for the 20 medium cloves in the recipe, just squeeze one roasted bulb and smash with a knife - or even the bottom of a glass.","1702225555","7"
"117270654","venk","I used a mix of black garlic and white garlic cloves to deepen the flavor and add some sweetness","1646705261","6"
"117469132","Allison","I used squid ink pasta, added 1 lb of shrimp and garnished with lao gan ma spicy chili crisp. Perfect!","1647914324","6"

"128331129","Deb","I’ve made countless NYT Cooking recipes, from quick and easy to crazy and complex. THIS. IS. THE BEST. I double all the sauce ingredients except for the garlic. Good lord. A divine, garlicky food coma. Just make it.","1696887894","6"
"117246994","Wm.","I have lately take him to using a microplane grater for garlic. Your fingers will smell, but it is very efficient.","1646589188","5"
"117329704","Mimi Pond","I’m no shrinking violet but this was just way way too much garlic. I made it as written but the 20 cloves- which did give me pause- made it completely overpowering. It went in the trash.","1647013991","5"
"117366092","EHSMD","This stuff is addictive! I reduced the butter and used a mix of parmigiano reggiano & pecorino.  Didn’t have fish sauce so I used a dab of anchovy paste mixed with soy sauce & rice vinegar.","1647268727","5"
"117504190","Great Brain","It's too much pasta. Sauce smells like the most amazing clam spaghetti (all that garlic & butter) you have ever tasted, and then disappears in a cooked pound of spaghetti. Next time I may add pasta water to sauce before adding cooked pasta. Give it more liquid to emulsify the cheese.  Tomorrow I'm going to sauté mushrooms, add some jamon and jazz this dish up.  Add cracked pepper too.","1648093724","5"
"122334331","yana","This recipe was a successful dinner for: 2 spoiled by NYC eating options adults and 2 ten year old kids (one is adventurous the other is not when it comes to food). No leftovers. Repeat requests. Served with crispy asparagus (olive oil, salt, pepper). The only deviation from the recipe: I sprinkled toasted sesame seeds.","1672705905","5"
"124732948","Suzanne Cronheim","This is one of my favorite NYT recipes. I follow it closely but I double or sometimes triple the sauce ingredients as we like a lot of sauce. We use buccatini and love this recipe.","1682696204","5"
"125184622","NB","Amazing! If you don’t like this, you didn’t go it right.  Made single serving by dividing by 4. I will stress you need to undercook your pasta. My cheese clumped but I turned the heat up and added more and more pasta water and stirred until it turned into the gorgeously creamy sauce in the picture.   had no oyster sauce so I doubled the soy and fish sauce. I am amazed that, even with 5 cloves garlic in 1 portion, the garlic flavor was subtle. Creamy smooth and umami.","1684472739","5"
"129288418","Brie","I have made this numerous times over the past couple years for my family. I have made it with rice noodles mostly but ANY noodle will work. I have even used Banza for an easy complete meal. Made as written, tastes like the best ""pasta roni"" ever. With simple adjustments to the recipe you can change the flavor profile to fit any meal. Like sesame oil and extra fish sauce for a more asian feel or extra cheese and roasted garlic for a more italian feel. The possibilities are endless! A Must try!","1700505717","5"

"124305968","Bob D","If you are cooking crab at the same time you make this recipe….then cook the pasta in the same water you boil crab. The mix of crab water and starch of noodles along with the ingredients suggested creates the most similiar flavor to the restaurant dish. Use that water to thicken the sauce.","1681003571","4"
"129296217","postjack","Yeah hey everybody, glad everyone is enjoying this recipe. I also enjoyed it but it is too much garlic. 70g of garlic is too much. You look at it and you're like ""wow 20 cloves, that looks like way too much garlic"". Well I'm here to confirm that. It's too much garlic. I just got through eating a bowl and I loved every bite but it's too much garlic. I am all garlic now, my whole body is garlic and my mind and emotions and soul.

"122071092","Elizabeth","I’d seen this recipe pass through a few times, and when I saw it was one of the most popular of 2022 I tried it out. I made it for lunch on a Saturday and it was so amazing that I made it again for dinner that night. I made it exactly as written except for halving it each time. No idea how leftovers taste since there weren’t any. Easy and quick and absolutely delicious.","1671320748","3"
"122144934","Blue Lamb","Made for one - myself. Delicious. Made following modifications- added dash of Worcestershire sauce, splash of white wine (why not),pinch of red pepper flakes, and handful of baby spinach. Used one pat  of butter as I am not a butter lover and half of other sauce ingredients for about quarter of lb of spaghetti. Made generous serving and ate every bit.","1671671911","3"
"122192147","Kim","I reduced the garlic to about eight cloves and this was delicious! I added some shrimp for a delightfully simple weeknight meal. The sauces and the cheese gave it all the salty goodness it needed. Plan to use this as a starter recipe for many meals to come!","1671891922","3"
"122207794","Carol E","I made this using a little less garlic and substituted a small amount of anchovy paste for the fish sauce. It was delicious! I added sautéed shrimp and served it over raw spinach. Makes a great quick dinner.","1672064295","3"
"122339737","Karyn in Berkeley","Insanely good... used only 3/4 lb pasta for 2 of us. ( I like more stuff ratio)...I had hoped to have a leftover. We ate it all! I will make this again and again. ..oh and used the meat mallet trick... way to go!","1672756430","3"
"122393924","Diana","Do this right (and don't be me): use fresh garlic, not preminced! I was being lazy and while the dish was good, it really would have sung with fresh garlic. It needed a little more salt and a little heat so we added a pinch of red pepper. I made a super simple stirfry of shrimp and broccoli with garlic and soy sauce (blanched broccoli for 1 min first) and mixed it in when the noodles were done. Will definitely repeat with fresh garlic.","1672970412","3"
"122414800","Stephen Martin","Really delicious.  Second time I made it I added seeded chopped fresh Campari tomatoes at the end and it was fabulous.","1673052412","3"

"125045120","Misha","This is really good served with a fried egg on top. The gooey yolk makes it like a carbonara umami bomb.","1683923426","3"
"125414043","Joufflu","Excellent dish, ready in no time. The umami is strong. I recommend finishing with some Madagascar black pepper. Hi from France.","1685469366","3"
"127482431","Ragbert","Yum!!!! Much tastier than the ingredient list would seem.  I cut the recipe in half, but next time I think I'll keep the full amount of the sauce and just cut the pasta amount in half.  I did the smash-then-mince thing with the garlic, because I don't own a mortar & pestle, and it worked perfectly well.  Additional ideas for toppings/mix-ins next time:  mixed seafood (Trader Joe's sells this frozen, ready to cook), shelled edamame, cut up broccoli, halved grape tomatoes, or sliced bok choy.","1693805450","3"
"129285455","Lindy","Garlic cloves vary greatly in size so I'm curious to know approximately what ""20 medium cloves"" minced or mashed translates to in tablespoons or dry ingredient cup measure. Anyone?","1700498637","3"
"129314320","Cass","Now that I'm older and the arthritis in my hands is an issue I've needed to make adjustments.  Garlic and ginger that comes in a tube is easy to use and adds a nice flavor.  It may not be the same as smashing, dicing or grating fresh bulbs or roots but better than nothing.","1700595848","3"
"131700628","Maritza","After seeing this on my IG feed 20x a day for months, I finally decided to get the ingredients and make it. I HATE when I’m disappointed with recipes I was excited about. Am I the only one who was expecting more of an umami bomb? I just got garlic. I didn’t really taste anything else. I followed the recipe as written and…I’m totally bummed.","1709866379","3"
"131859521","Heather","We’re a garlic-lovin’ family, so I thought this would be a slam dunk, but we all found it bitter and overwhelmingly garlicky. It was just…unpleasant. I wouldn’t make it again, and that’s saying something, considering how much I love garlic.","1710458586","3"
"133972039","Frank_w","Don't salt the water when you cook the pasta.  The soy sauce, fish sauce and parmesan bring plenty of salt.","1718664651","3"
"117580074","Sue Welty","I was a little disappointed in this recipe. I expected it to be more flavorful and found it to be very, very subtle in flavors. I may add just a bit more of the fish and oyster sauces next time or even a pinch of red pepper flakes.","1648515330","2"
"119485762","Adrienne","If someone could add the weight of the fresh garlic they (successfully) used, that would be very helpful.  Apparently our garlic cloves are very large, and this was a bit of a garlicky mess for us.","1658716417","2"
"120567107","Joy","Go light on salt in pasta water bc of saltiness of other ingredients.   Made Sept 2022 with substitutions based on ingredients at home.  Kikkoman Soy Sauce instead of oyster sauce  Worcestershire Sauce instead of Light Soy Sauce  Coriander instead of spring onions for freshness Felt it needed:  - a bit of lemon juice (very little),  - crushed dry chilli for heat,  - fresh black pepper, - extra cheese. Would be interesting to try with the smallest bit of numbing oil.","1663969471","2"
"121898809","Isabella","Came out great! I added some shelled edamame with the pasta so it would be a full meal with vegetable, which worked great.","1670466218","2"
"122051081","Delise","This was not a hit in my house. My only tweak to the recipe was to use one tsp of fish sauce and one tsp of Maggi. Might have been better w/ all Maggi, as was suggested by a commenter, but I'll never find out bc I will NEVER make this again.","1671206493","2"
"122201091","Ellen","It's typical at Thanh Long to have these noodles accompanied by a roasted crab.  Unforgettable !!!","1671985406","2"

"122602033","Amanda","I have to say with the amount of garlic in this recipe, the taste is pretty underwhelming. I feel like maybe it’s because of the amount of pasta- 1lb seems like it may have been too much for the amount of sauce. Not sure I’ll ever make again, but if I do, I’m going to cut the amount of spaghetti in half.","1673921188","2"
"123324833","johnny case","Easy and delicious.  Because I'm lazy, I use pre-minced garlic and smash it to a paste in a mortar and pestle.  Much faster and still tastes good.  I have cooked the noodles according to the recipe and while it works it makes a mess.  So now I just boil them in a deep pot as I normally would and after I drain them I drop them back in the deep pot and add the garlic sauce.  I reserve some of the water just in case.  Much easier and less messy and comes out exactly the same!","1676992948","2"
"124061677","Ewkuo","This was an instant favorite with my garlic loving family. I mixed in some chicken and bok choy (cut into shreds and lightly stir fried/sautéed) to make it more well-balanced as a one dish meal. Delicious!","1680047391","2"
"129287470","LJ","I use fresh garlic most of the time when I cook, but there are times when I’m in a hurry or microwaving something, or realize that I’ve run out of garlic bulb’s . Enter Dorot frozen garlic cubes, found at Trader Joe’s. Not as good as fresh garlic, but much much better than the jars of chopped garlic. You can keep it in the freezer for those moments when you realize you’ve run out of fresh garlic and the pot is already on the stove.","1700503334","2"
"129290239","Amy S","Just made this for lunch today. Needed a quick comfort meal and was really craving carbs. Check and check. Best thing ever. I halved it, but otherwise didn't change a thing. Used garlic from the garden. The sauce was perfect and creamy. It may seem scant, but the flavor is just right. I will make this again and again.","1700510564","2"

"131463465","RJ","I simply roasted about two small bulbs of garlic. Which not only makes it soft, flavorful and fragrant. I added that to the pan, and mashed it with the back of the spoon.","1709067423","2"
"131648060","John - Hertford, NC","Try putting all the garlic in a zip-top bag and crush them in a tortilla press. Quick and easy. The press is also great for easily flattening pork or chicken for cutlets. No more tedious pounding. Sandwich the meat between two plastic wrap, drop the press, and move along.","1709689523","2"
