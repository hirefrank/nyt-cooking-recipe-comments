"117445153","avery","Didn’t have any short grain rice so I used basmati rice and it worked great! Grocery store didn’t have boneless skinless thighs so I just deboned regular thighs and kept the skin. Happened to have TJ’s Thai lime and chili cashews and they added the perfect amount of spice. Pretty flavorful recipe- would make again!","1647750319","318"
"117439241","Sue","We don't eat chicken, but this was great with tempeh (sliced & cooked atop the rice; no initial browning). I used two peppers for more veg and added a few shakes of tumeric for color.","1647714491","228"
"117551024","Ed in San Diego","Made this last night with the following changed suggested by others: I doubled the garlic and ginger, and used jasmine rice, light coconut milk, and added 1 Tbs garam masala, 1 Tbs fish sauce, and 1 seeded jalapeño pepper to the rice and broth.  Those changes made it anything but bland, it was a delicious hit!  Will definitely make it again, and it was easy. A great recipe that you can tailor to your liking with all sorts of additions or substitutions.  Five stars!","1648404254","214"
"117454284","robin","Used chickpeas instead of chicken.  Added half jalapeño with garlic and ginger.  Added yellow and orange peppers eppers and broccoli.  Used jasmine rice and cooked for 15 min. Really good!","1647823917","187"
"117444083","Sarah","Somehow I have 4 different types of rice, but no short grain. Anyone have any thoughts on using long grain white rice instead?","1647741710","178"
"117449525","JennA","Anyone sub with breasts?","1647795553","176"
"117453615","DF","I had a friend from Afghanistan who made this dish, and called it Bor Pilau.  Some carrots add color when thrown in about halfway through cooking.  And when I was in college, the Fanny Farmer cookbook has a very similar recipe made with chicken or pork chops, and deemed it South American.   Guess a good idea is a good idea the world over.","1647819443","156"
"117453245","Gregg","Loved this, definitely add hot sauce, which I would never have guessed to do.  I'd double the ginger, salt liberally, and add a half cup of raisins which added some sweet depth.  I used Calrose rice.  This is really good and really easy.","1647817143","154"
"117448390","Janet M","Made with basmati rice. Loved it with green Tabasco. Extremely easy, and it was the best new recipe I’ve made in a while.","1647790022","137"
"117448438","Lori Grannis","Very important to use large crystal kosher salt in this measurement. Substituting fine grain sea or table salt adds more sodium, simply because fine grain salt will amount to greater volume.","1647790210","119"
"117455298","rose","This was beyond the beyond of bland. I added turmeric, cumin and coriander and still so boring. I see why it recommends hot sauce","1647830860","117"
"117455185","No oven?","Has anyone tried this on the stove top with no oven?","1647829982","105"
"117448315","Cindy","I’d use gochujang.","1647789713","95"
"117515302","Cookie","Made this on the stove top...worked out very well. Serving with wedges of lime and hot sauce","1648156412","91"
"117465184","Liz","Solid recipe that’s on the bland side without the hot sauce.   I stirred in Sirachi, but think adding some red pepper flakes to the ginger sauté might add the needed heat.  I chopped my cashews too fine; larger pieces would have added more crunch.  Good enough to make again, and delicious for lunch the next day.","1647890734","90"
"117452966","Janet M","Vicki,  Yes, I used light coconut milk. It worked like a charm and was very flavorful.","1647815533","63"
"117513227","Faby","I substituted the chicken for boneless skinless breasts. With kitchen shears I cut the chicken breasts into about 50 cent coin sizes. I didn’t have scallions on hand so I just used red onion. This is going to have to be one of my frequent on the menu meals. It was so flavorful and delicious! I plan on substituting white rice for brown next time.","1648148038","57"
"117452261","Sue","Brown rice will take significantly longer to cook, so you might par-boil until the grains are just becoming tender (but still chalky at the center) before adding them to the dish when the recipe calls for the rinsed basmati.","1647811901","53"
"117455894","DL","For some reason when I saw the recipe photo I assumed the yellow chunks were pineapple, and now I might just try that…","1647836862","49"
"118050331","kiki","I made a lot of changes but it turned out awesome!  After browsing the chicken throw a chopped shallot or yellow onion in the pot with the pepper and sauté.    Then add the garlic and ginger and add 1/2 tsp turmeric, 1/2 tsp coriander and 1/2 tsp cumin and 2 Tbs Sriracha.   Sauté these and then do the rice and other steps and add 3 bay leaves before baking.   I added lime juice to finish it after it baked.    I would also consider adding peas.","1651102667","48"
"117453423","Brad","Yes, they are different. Green peppers are unripened peppers and have a very distinct taste. Peppers in different stages of ripeness, depending on the variety are yellow, orange and red. The yellow is the sweetest, orange about the same and the red has a very distinct ripened flavor and is the one most often used in Italian cooking.","1647818163","45"
"117463107","esther","I'll bet this would work great in the instant pot. 15 minutes on high pressure would do it.","1647882716","42"
"117508810","ConnieB","I've been craving fish curry, so I used this as a base. I added a can of tomatoes, some turmeric, cumin, garam masala, & red pepper flakes, subbed veggie stock for chicken, and used brown rice. I baked it for 30 minutes, stirred, then added chunks of fish over the top for the last 20-25 minutes until the rice was done. This was easy and delicious!","1648133552","36"
"117450015","Sandy","Use Arborio or any risotto rice","1647798113","35"
"117541402","Eric","Yes! As written this recipe contains about TWICE the daily suggested amount of saturated fat for one serving.  That's more than four Big Macs. Sorry but coconut milk fat is just as bad as animal fats according to the American Heart Association.","1648315917","35"
"117697528","Carolyn","Team Bland. The cooking liquid tasted and smelled fantastic when I started cooking the rice, but the rice just absorbs all the flavor, and it ends up bland. And I even doubled the garlic, ginger, and scallions, and added Tajin with lime. I was seduced by the one-pot mystique and regret it. I think it would have been good if I'd cooked the rice in the broth in another pot and simmered the rest of the ingredients in the coconut milk.","1649121829","33"
"117470176","Meridith P","I agree with Robert. If you use long grain rice (jasmine, basmati), 1-3/4 cups of broth PLUS a full can of coconut milk makes for a mushy outcome. Next time will try less broth if using jasmine rice (our house staple). Was still delicious, though!","1647923661","27"
"117454271","Corlan Johnson","Why not use low fat coconut milk?","1647823834","26"
"117465592","Kardon","Great dish.  Next time I'll use more scallions - maybe whole bunch - and more veggies like carrots; possibly add ginger slices too.","1647892791","26"
"117450556","Rjb","The only dumb question is one you don’t ask! “Rinsed until water runs clear” is an instruction for uncooked rice. Calling it a “one pot dish” is another clue that the rice doesn’t need separate treatment. Then, in this recipe, the rice cooks in the broth and coconut milk.","1647801359","24"
"117536765","SGS","Double ginger and garlic. Then use half on the chicken while it's browning.","1648256331","23"
"117502577","diane marrich-simon","Used chicken breasts successfully.","1648082778","22"
"118933873","Booky Beck","In response to other cooks’ comments, I doubled the garlic and ginger, added a minced onion and a tsp of red pepper flakes with them and threw in a rough tsp each of ground coriander and cumin. The measurement provided for scallions is misleading. I used more than a full bunch and barely had the half cup called for. I also added some raisins which did, in fact, add a lovely sweetness - a la an Indian biryani. It was FABULOUS, especially with some sriracha.","1655986696","22"
"120347709","Doug C.","Unlike several other reviewers, my wife and I did not find this to be bland and though it was quite tasty. It is NOT a spicy dish, and the coconut milk dominates.   HOWEVER, I noticed one thing — if I added hot sauce (we used Frank's), the coconut rice was overwhelmed by the spice and did seem rather bland.   My suggestion: SKIP THE HOT SAUCE! (And I say that as someone who loves spicy food and uses a lot of hot sauce on other things.)","1662909470","21"
"120633448","Brendan O","I’ve made this a couple of times now with these enhancements that really make it special: - Add a second pepper. I chose red - Increase chicken broth to 2 cups - Add one tablespoon each cumin and turmeric to mixture - Double cashews to 1 cup - Add 1/2 cup yellow raisins","1664315218","21"
"117447125","Robert","Seems like a liquid to rice ration. Cut it down for long grain rice.","1647784058","20"
"117502714","Lois","This was delicious and an easy weeknight meal.  I used brown basmati rice and light coconut milk to make it healthier.","1648083759","19"
"120833296","Rachel","This is a great base recipe, but is bland if you make it as is. Definitely needed more acid and spice. I seasoned the chicken with some cumin, coriander, and chili powder in addition to s&p. Added cayenne, gochujang, lime juice, and a little fish sauce to the broth. Topped with sriracha and more lime. Turned out well!","1665237496","17"
"117541304","Gerry","Coconut is subtle. Add shredded coconut to taste it more.","1648315281","16"
"117523757","Stacey","I found this bland and off-putting. The ginger and garlic barely come through. It’s mostly just a mildly coconutty congeal of sticky rice with an occasional piece of pepper or chicken. Hot sauce helped a lot. But I like a very flavorful dishes and different textures, which this isn’t really.","1648213152","15"
"117492222","Angèle","This was a huge hit - made this for a quick weeknight dinner with my roommate. I am a home cook and she is a ""let's do what is easy and will result in the fewest dishes"" person - this dish struck the perfect balance! I recommend adding a splash of fish sauce or coco aminos if you have it, for a little extra umami. We also used basmati rice b/c that is what we had on hand. Other than that, we followed the recipe exactly and were so impressed at the high flavor yield. Simply delish! 5 stars!","1648048544","11"
"118943743","Rachel in New York","Super easy and fairly tasty one-pot recipe!  I followed the recipe pretty closely except I didn’t have cilantro. It was decent, but bc of the chicken fat, coconut milk, and nuts, it really needs a little something to cut through the richness. None of my hot sauces were quite right, so I used red curry paste instead (thinned w hot water). Perfect! Next time I’ll use more salt, remove some rendered chicken fat, fry curry paste with aromatics, use cilantro, and finish w a squeeze of lime.","1656011543","11"
"117499289","Burban","Loved this recipe. Added raisins per another’s rec, and didn’t bother to wash rice. Actually took just 45 min, which is unusual since most NYT recipes underestimate time.","1648067242","10"
"118711422","Frank","I used sambal oelek for the hot sauce and it was outstanding!  Really good contrast and depth against the coconut milk rice.  The downside to that is those who do not like spicey and left that off thought it was bland, though I was forced to use ground ginger at the last minute.  The cilantro didn't add much value, but I dark roasted my cashews in the oven while I browned the chicken and I think that added a lot of texture and flavor.  Might change out the yellow pepper next time.","1654703253","10"
"118178003","mce","Did steps 1-2   sautéing ginger and garlic on the stove, then continued in the instant pot. Cooked on high for 10 mins, 5 mins natural release. The chicken was tender, rice fully cooked. Only other edits: Arborio rice, extra ginger, some gochugaru chili flakes, and wasn’t shy w the salt - delightful flavor and texture. Next time I’d like more color in there and will toss in some broccoli.","1651770952","8"
"128195508","JW","- More garlic, ginger, scallions; double bell pepper - Cut chicken into smaller pieces; slightly larger than bite sized - Added cumin to chicken; also added a bit of flour before browning - Sautéed only scallion whites; left greens for topping - Added some red pepper flakes   lime zest to garlic/ginger/scallion whites - Used sushi rice - KEEP BELL PEPPERS and CASHEWS separate! Add peppers after 18-20 minutes - Top with cashews, scallion greens, cilantro, squeeze of lime, and chili crisp","1696390707","7"
"117541281","Gerry","I’ve tried this recipe a couple of times with seitan instead of chicken, and it was a huge hit both times. Once was similar to the recipe except for adding more vegetables for color and flavor. The second time also added two teaspoons of a prepared sauce, in this case Panang curry, and it was far better. Note: this recipe really needs a fresh Thai chili.","1648315178","6"
"117638451","Cindy from Upstate Ny","Bland.  Won’t be making it again","1648773173","6"
"120132639","denver cook","This meal was very bland, although the rice came out perfect. It needs something more. Serrano peppers? Red pepper flakes? As is, the time/effort was not worth the final result.","1661832548","6"
"117455573","angelasusan","The green pepper/capsicum is unripe and tastes distinctively different to any ripe capsicums. Yellow, red and a (slightly) weird orange coloured capsicum are all ripe (all start green) and have their own slightly different flavours but are more like each other in taste than any are to green. Varieties can also vary in shape and thickness of the wall. Mostly we can choose blocky or bullshorn shaped capsicums in the markets but if you grow your own you can explore the range of colours and shapes.","1647833155","5"
"117538848","Paige","So bland. Made as directed, plus a heaping tablespoon of curry powder. Lots of Sriracha after to doctor it up.","1648298416","5"
"117541575","Sharon","I cooked this as written with one addition of turmeric (based on comments here).  We really liked it  and it was great the next day too.","1648316885","5"
"118817465","liz","Fee free to bulk up on the ginger, garlic and green onions.","1655238457","5"
"121900270","Disappointed","I really wanted to love this. I followed the recipe to a tee except I used bone-in skin-on chicken thighs. Came out weirdly gingery yet bland at the same time. Tried to fix it with several different hot sauces, soy, and lime. Nothing made it work. Feels like it wants to be too many things at once and ends up being nothing. Maybe that's a one-pot recipe problem. It would have been better just to make a curry and use a second pot for rice. I don't think I'll try it again.","1670476811","5"
"122014102","Helen","Can this recipe be cooked entirely on the stovetop?","1671052276","5"
"124953843","Juliet","Add some fish sauce along with broth and coconut milk; and lime juice at the end! You won't be sorry.","1683592419","5"
"117437449","Peggy Herron","Probably any hot sauce that you use at home.","1647706881","4"
"117464021","EmEl","Great, did completely as recipe states except for adding a hot red pepper with the seeds. Used Arborio rice as one commenter suggests. Prep takes a long time; cooking is simple and fast. One tip: it was still rather liquidy after I took it out of the oven but after it had sat for a bit, the rice absorbed a lot of liquid, making the end results wonderfully creamy!","1647886035","4"
"117467415","Lyn","Maybe 5 minutes per side per batch for the chicken?","1647903080","4"
"121976250","Jen F.","Made as written. It was just ok, and bland. Did not taste like coconut at all. My family didn't love it and called it ""glop.""","1670915830","4"
"121995707","Justin","1 tbsp green curry paste at step 3 = magic","1670987323","4"
"128065162","Liz","I saw all the comments on blandness so added some red pepper flakes and garam masala to the sauté, which really punched up the flavor. I used arborio rice,  which worked well.","1695928704","4"
"129605711","my notes","Update: double the ginger, double the garlic. use an entire bunch of scallions, chop up both the whites and the greens. Throw the whites into sauté with the ginger and garlic, then throw the greens in with the rest of the ingredients. Squeeze lime over the top at the end, and serve with a lime wedge and extra cilantro. Short grain rice is best to make it sticky, but basmati works fine too.","1701918477","4"
"131665388","Eli W","Made this following helpful comments. My adjustments:  1. Season chicken in advance if possible. Added some Fly By Jing masala seasoning for some depth 2. 7 cloves garlic, 2 big knobs ginger, half jalapeno in aromatics. Salt this mix too.  3. Once cooked, mixed in raw spinach to wilt under the heat.  4. Saved the cashews for crunchy topping. Also top with more scallion greens and LIME! This dish needs acid/citrus and pairs perfectly with hot sauce. This is the key imo.","1709748262","4"
"118854667","Shannon","Used what I had: chicken breasts, basmati rice, carrots, and an onion. I added cilantro and Thai basil and lime at the end and threw some Chile crisp in right before putting it in the oven. Delicious! I will make this again.","1655433808","3"
"120143110","susan c","We used 2 lbs of chicken, doubled the ginger, doubled the cashews, 6-7 scallions, and a few pinches more of salt and it turned out great!  Next time I would also add chopped mango to the finished dish.","1661877392","3"
"122083598","Greglorious","Loved this - made this but added bok choi 10 minutes before it finishes baking to add some greens.  Also used basmati rice and it turned out superb.    Why do so many of the NYT one pot recipes not have enough vegetables?!  It’s like they leave one ingredient short of a full meal","1671423214","3"
"117544038","Doodles","Oops. Found the other tablespoon.","1648332944","2"
"121642925","Jessica K.","The chicken was very flavorful and tender, but this was really bland.  Definitely needed some hot sauce to wake it up a little bit.  Maybe some lemon and more herbs would have amped it up a little bit.","1669178721","2"
"122081646","DD","Meh this was pretty bland and boring but my two small kids liked it bc of that? I would add some fish sauce next time and maybe add the toasted cashews as a garnish so they don’t get mushy and add some crunch. Peppers add very little flavor here too so I would sub something like spinach or a sweet potato instead","1671406411","2"
"131773323","Jill S.","Having read other user comments...I used 2 tablespons minced garlic and 3 tablespoons minced ginger.  I also added red pepper flakes around the pot to spice up the dish when it was time to cook the garlic and ginger.  For nuts, I only had chopped ""sundae"" nuts in the cupboard and they worked well.  Once the coconut milk and chicken broth were in, I added an 8 ounce container of sliced white mushrooms.  This created a dish that reminds me of the flavors in the Thai soup--Tom Kah Gai.","1710186322","2"
"132026468","mellini","I made a double batch (I like to  cook, but also like to have a few nights off) with sushi rice, added two sliced jalapeno peppers. We ate dishes of this deliciousness tonight with chili crisp (lao gon make) and lime pickle - so so very good!","1711100397","2"
