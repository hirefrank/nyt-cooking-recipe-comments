"121201316","Blodwyn","Do you have a Trader Joe’s near you? You can get an 8 ounce box of shelf-stable whipping cream there. I keep a few boxes in the pantry. It’s perfect when you just need a small amount of cream.","1667053041","489"
"121173821","Independent Observer","I'd recommend putting some minced garlic and sliced mushrooms into the butter and chili crisp combo and sauté over medium heat for around 30 seconds (do not brown garlic). Heat the cream and melt a dollop of gorgonzola into it before adding it to the butter, garlic and mushrooms (and go easy on the gorgonzola since you don't want it to dominate the entire dish).","1666908359","296"
"121200308","Pixie","Heated the butter, added shrimp and garlic. Sautéed shrimp til pink. I then removed shrimp from pan, set aside. Followed other directions exactly. Added shrimp back in at the end. Delicious and easy.","1667048061","155"
"121208149","ReadyAbout","This tastes like a decadent dish you'd pay a lot for in a restaurant. I diluted the heavy cream  a bit: 1/2 half and half, 1/2 heavy cream. Next time I will toss in some more spinach. I added garlic slices while sautéing the butter/chile crisp. Next time I will add mushrooms as well. Definitely add chile crisp on top when plating the dish - SO good!","1667090867","152"
"121175222","Betsy Teutsch","now that I have a induction cooktop, the water boils in a minute, tops. It is so fast it requires reorganizing cooking strategies. Love it!","1666915912","149"
"121213004","Martha Pacitti","I am familiar with chili condiments but have not heard of ""chili crisp."" Can anyone enlighten me or provide a photo of how this product is sold? Many thanks in advance! Also, love the idea of garlic in this dish (Vitamin G as it is known in my house).","1667148905","127"
"121216458","Berk","Used kite hill cream cheese instead of heavy cream and Miyoko butter to make this vegan. Had kale from the garden rather than spinach. Really great: the sauce, just spicy enough, coated the fettuccine perfectly.","1667173431","103"
"121335087","Allison","Chili Crisp - if you have time, Momofuku has the most amazing chili crisp on the market in my opinion but you have to order online and it ships.  They have several different types and spice levels so if you're unfamiliar, just start with their original.  After awhile, you'll use it like Americans do ketchup or ranch dressing....at anytime, on anything, anywhere, breakfast, lunch and dinner.  :-)","1667678982","99"
"121218483","smernit","Made this tonight. Used whole milk instead of cream and upped the chili crisp. It was GOOOOODDDDD.   Will def make again.","1667191439","75"
"121191486","bbb","Can this be done using pasta water or butter instead of cream?","1666978517","72"
"121322975","Umm, okay.","Maybe it's because I used Parmigiano Regianno. Maybe it's because I added a little garlic (per a reader suggestion, gratz!) Maybe it's because I made the full amount of sauce for half the amount of pasta called for. Whatever. This is a KEEPER!","1667601128","69"
"121300928","David410","Great recipe.  Substituted silken tofu blitzed in a bullet blender for the heavy cream (added a bit of water).  Whole wheat pasta... Tasted great, good protein, less empty carbs.  Used jarred Momokufu chili crisp - super simple.","1667526885","63"
"121179731","Wordsworth from Wadsworth","Go easy on the chili crisp.   It does not taste really hot, but it builds on the palate.  I think this a great, inventive, easy dish, and All American drawing from different traditions.   I love floggin' down new pasta dishes.   But my waistline does not.","1666942250","62"
"121215900","KT","Just made a vegan version of this with homemade pasta, Miyokos butter, homemade cashew milk, store bought chili crisp, and Whole Foods plant based shredded Parmesan. Super delicious, but would definitely add a bit more pasta water to the sauce next time as the cashew milk definitely thickens up quite a bit!","1667169333","52"
"121211991","Kathryn","Tried this as written and was a hit for a quick meal last night. Used one tablespoon of chili crisp, but will use two next time—the cream mitigates the heat. Tip, use a roomy skillet; mine was a little tight for tossing the mixture around.","1667143449","49"
"121317511","Barb","Made this 2 times now...loved it as written but I tossed 1 TBSP of the chili crisp with some shrimp to marinate for about 10 minutes then sauteed it with 2 tbsp of the butter, a couple of cloves of garlic and the other tbsp of crisp. After removing the shrimp I added the other 2 tbsp of butter and the cream. I used Fly by Jing szechuan chili crisp and it was numbingly perfect!","1667585536","28"
"121573855","Karen G","Vastly improved with a splash of lemon at the end!","1668830709","27"
"121300466","K Brown","Added 2 cloves of garlic to butter and chili crisp; then sauté 8 oz of shiitake mushrooms in the chili mix; half heavy cream and half half and half; and 10 ounces of spinach at the end. Amazing fall/winter dish going into the rotation.","1667525160","22"
"121217604","Jan_sc","My husband and I are mostly vegan, but I still really wanted to try this dish. I substituted the heavy cream for a cashew Alfredo sauce. The results were incredible. We couldn't stop eating it. This recipe is a five star winner!  Thank Genevieve!","1667181849","21"
"121178321","thegreenpinkie","Simple, fantastic and works with any pasta.  Thanks for an easy quick dinner tonight!","1666929798","20"
"121177578","LTF","I made this a a gazillion times for school night dinners. Couple of drops of fish sauce amps up everything too.  Out of curiosity, what makes it an Alfredo? The kids just called spicy pasta.","1666926601","14"
"121267329","Bazz","Next time I would double the amount of chili crisp used. The color was more creamy looking than the firey orange in the photo. Bonus points for not needing to chop anything or use a cutting board period. :)","1667404257","14"
"122081699","Christopher","We've made this dish four times in only the two months since we found it. Yum. Add 4 garlic cloves roughly chopped to butter and chili crisp in step 2. Increase heavy cream to 1.25 cups. Lots of spinach, the dish will easily accomodate 10 or up to 16oz - this makes for more of a meal.  Parmesan cheese increase to 3 oz plus more. Change steps, drain pasta (reserve water), pasta quickly back to pan, add spinach and pasta water to wilt and stir. Add cream mixture and stir. Mixes easier.","1671406820","13"
"121278111","Lynne","I’ve made this three times since the recipe was revealed. The first I made it as written except I live alone and am not a hothead. I love it. The second time I added frozen peas and cut up ham. The third I added broccoli and ham. I love it. It’s easy and comforting. Not as spicy as I expected but just lovely. I’ll make this over and over again.","1667435609","12"
"121561627","Farron","I made this with 2% fat yogurt instead of the cream. Less caloric and I found it fine. Take off the heat to stir in so it doesn't curdle.","1668795414","12"
"122258034","Caroline","If I may add, you can use a table spoon or more of fermented Crushed Calabrian Chili Peppers from Trader Joe's it is called Italian Bomba hot pepper sauce instead of the chili crisp making. Bon Appétit!","1672267407","10"
"121209972","Joanne","Has anyone tried a vegan version? I am wondering about oat milk or almond milk.","1667126740","9"
"121218435","Denise K","I had to Google that ingredient, to make sure it wasn't the same as garlic chili sauce; it isn't.  My regular grocery store didn't have it in the Asian aisle but Whole Foods had 3 different options.  I bought one made in my home state, for $10 (Cin Soy brand).  The other two were both higher.  I don't see a way to share a pic of the jar though.  It's sold in the center of the store, refrigerate after opening.","1667190788","8"
"121246819","Barbara","Even though I, too, laugh at the way people modify recipes in unrecognizable ways, learning from cooking notes is a fun part of this app. So, in that spirit, I am sharing that last night, I made this recipe with spaghetti squash instead of pasta; sautéed mushrooms and garlic in the butter before the chile crisps made their brief lap around the pan; and used 1/2 c. Silk whipping cream and 1/2 c. half and half. It totally worked as a delicious low-carb, lower fat hack.","1667319824","7"
"121259302","bacongougere","ALSO: I used a great chile crisp. Fly By Jing is the BOMB. Order it. Or, if you are in the Portland OR area, some New Seasons carry it.","1667366554","7"
"121323402","Umm, okay.","Oh dear.","1667602566","7"
"121206272","Family of 4","Made exactly as written and it’s awesome. Always thought fettuccine Alfredo was boring. You know what it needs? Chili crunch (or crisp) and spinach! Plus a little dusting of salt at the end. An easy and tasty recipe. Will definitely make this again.","1667076849","5"
"122710805","Beth","I made this dish with Barnacle Seafood Chili Kelp Crisp (check it out- real Kelp harvested from the waters of Alaska) and whole milk (to cut down on the fat)- super yummy and now a staple in our house-- the kelp re hydrates for beautiful flecks of kelp in the dish!","1674324937","5"
"129604101","Rebecca L.","For a vegan version, I recommend using olive oil instead of butter and silken tofu instead of heavy cream! Just blend the tofu with a blender or stand mixer and it mimics the texture of heavy cream very well. Just add a little pasta water to thin it out if needed.","1701912960","5"
"129653598","AB Cincy","Doubled spinach, added bacon, subbed sour cream. This is a restaurant dish.","1702082884","5"
"130263492","Tim O'Donoghue","This dish is in regular rotation at our house..  I've made this with heavy cream as well as half 'n half.  Neither my wife nor I  can tell much difference.  So try the half 'n half substitution for a slightly lighter fare.","1704492509","5"
"121205907","MRiolo","I sure do. Not sure what the point of your comment is, but you can easily go to the store and buy some cream- problem solved!","1667075014","4"
"121410448","Jeanne T","Absolutely DELICIOUS!!!!","1668082519","4"
"121918295","CKT","This was absolutely delicious! But, I won’t say my stomach didn’t hurt the next day. I would halve the chili crisp next time - I think it’s hard on sensitive stomachs.","1670608142","4"
"130165279","Name Shelle","This is amazing. I substituted kale for spinach and cashew cream for heavy cream based on what I had on hand. It was delicious and even my kids had several helpings. I was hoping for leftovers but it’s all gone!","1704212231","4"
"130179581","Katrina","Tried this tonight with spaghetti (all we had) and added broccoli and onion. Amazing!! Such an easy, delicious sauce. Husband also raved. Will add garlic next time.","1704242074","4"
"135975328","Erica","Just made this w/ zucchini noodles- garlic and mushrooms- home made almond milk- no spinach- and is this fantastic! The zoodles cooked in the sauce, I only used a scant amount of the milk as I knew it wouldn’t really thicken. Wasn’t sure about parm and chili crisp- but now I am a believer!","1725581302","4"
"132227035","YUM!","I added mushrooms shrimp as comments suggested. Used homage egg pasta. After tasting, decided it needed acid. Pinch of lemon set it off! I appreciate the comments section so I thought I’d add what made it work for us.","1711931009","3"
"127881346","Amy","This was terrific.  I used 1/2 and 1/2 with a bit of regular milk.  Added cremini mushrooms with the butter at the beginning and 2 cloves of thinly sliced garlic.  Doubled the spinach.  Fast, easy and delicious.","1695250411","2"
"130441348","Tara","Always read the first 5 notes! Added the shrimp, mushrooms and garlic and subbed collard greens for the spinach. Enjoy the collards texture more than spinach. 3/4 cup heavy cream. Anything I’ve made with chili crisp is always amazing.","1705187119","2"
"130799357","Daniel","Came out really well, and is one of the easiest pasta dishes I've ever made. I agree with some of the comments that it could probably use some garlic, then again so could basically anything.","1706573163","2"
"136062221","Chris","The quality of the chili crisp matters so much for this dish! Made it the first time with whatever we had in the fridge (think it was Mr Bing) and it was meh. Upgraded to Kari Kari (available at local shops if you’re in Seattle, or online) and the difference was incredible. Now this dish is in regular rotation for our family!","1725933885","2"
"136250735","D","Wondering if yogurt would work here in place of the heavy cream. Anyone tried this?","1726590056","2"
