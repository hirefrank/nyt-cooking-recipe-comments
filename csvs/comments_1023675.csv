"121793305","Kristen","These were incredibly delicious. The gochujang caramel adds a subtle spice reminiscent of gingerbread. However, I would have swirled the gochujang caramel into the dough before it chilled and stiffened to more easily achieve the proper rippling effect.","1669985163","261"
"121816486","Dorinf","Yes you can make them smaller. I used a 2 TBS scoop (1/8 cup) and cooked for 13 minutes. The 19 resulting cookies were 3"" in diameter and delicious.","1670092517","197"
"122125708","Shannon","These are the best cookies I have ever eaten! I used the exact ingredients, but I patted out the cookie dough (which was much firmer than Eric's in his video - I have a cold house and my flour may be drier than his) and spread the gochujang unevenly on top, then rolled it up in a log, chilled in the freezer for 15 minutes and cut in thick slices. I got 24  beautiful, crunchy, sweet, salty & spicy cookies with a beautiful swirl pattern. I'm making them again tonight!","1671581281","193"
"121790942","Adam LeClair","Please just make these. They’re are amazing. Just…. Amazing! Make as is. And let your life be greatly improved! My only note is I got a better thatch when left in the oven more on the 13 min side.","1669958568","126"
"121837016","Brendan","You will make a lot of mistakes today. Making these will not be one of them. Amazing cookies.","1670205228","101"
"121978933","Kat","Re: the swirling. After reading others notes, I came up with my own approach. Before chilling, I warmed up the gochujang sauce to make it a little thinner, pressed the dough down in the bowl a bit, and did about half a tablespoon of drizzle back and forth over the dough. Then I folded the dough in half and repeated three or four times - basically a lamination approach. Chilled for 15 minutes, and proceeded. It worked beautifully, with big thick ribbons of caramel through the cookies.","1670938015","92"

"121784322","Holmestead","Eric, this one is a keeper! Thank you for working so hard to create such amazing recipes that are easy to follow, use ingredients I almost always have on hand, and taste fantastic! The balance of sweet to spicy is perfect!","1669932111","54"
"121860299","Emily H","These are mind blowing! I veganized these using 3tbsp Just Egg and vegan butter and it worked flawlessly. I found the dough to be a little crumbly at first, which isn’t unusual for vegan cookies, but after 15 min in the fridge it came together. I also only had a 2 tbsp cookie scoop instead of a 1/4 cup scoop called for and it worked out great - 12.5 min worked for me but I started checking at 11. Make these!","1670334593","47"
"121799726","mellowbaker","Love it, the cookie had a great flavor profile - especially if you’re someone who has enjoyed miso cookies in the past - this recipe creates similar umami notes. I struggled to mix the caramel in properly without over-mixing. Ultimately, I did over-mix the two components which caused the cookies to spread too large. Next time I would dollop a bit of the caramel on top of each cookie and swirl it in with a offset knife or something, to avoid this issue.","1670000398","45"
"121843859","RoLo","Egg whites make cookies crunchy. Bakers actually remove egg white from recipes to make their cookies chewier; that's why so many cookie recipes with the word ""chewy"" in their title will call for 1 egg+ 1-2 yolks. This is also why whites are called for in recipes where you want ""stiffening"" action, like meringues and coconut macaroons (they help dry out and harden the coconut) and even royal icing.","1670254496","39"
"121811515","Hannah C","This was truly a perfect cookie. Sweet & chewy with a slight surprise from the gochujang. I was skeptical before making, but Eric Kim never misses. I dolloped the gochujang butter on top after scooping and folded the cookie over itself, baked for 13 mins, and they came out absolutely perfect. Adding to my cookie roto!","1670038459","37"
"121823224","Peggo","Nice cookie--like a snickerdoodle with a kick. A few people said it tasted like a bbq sauce-infused sugar cookie. I suspect that is about the brand of gochujang you are using,  I used some from a nearby grocery store because I was out of my usual (which I buy at an Asian market)  and also had this experience. Then I tasted the paste itself and...ick. It really did taste like bbq sauce. So maybe try again with better product?","1670129145","28"
"121817759","Midwesterner","Wow!  Best cookie I’ve made in a while—and a nice different twist to add to cookie trays/care packages.  Did 2 Tbl scoops, made 23, baked 13 mins.  My gochugang was stiff so I had to microwave it a little, which I’m sure made the “caramel” easier to swirl (did before chilling dough).  Definitely making again.  Soon.","1670100234","24"
"121821015","CT","I was so excited to see a cookie recipe with gochujang.  I wanted a gluten free version so used Bob's Red Mill 1 to 1 but only had 1 cup so added 1/2 cup cornmeal. Otherwise followed instructions. And they are amazing. Crispy, chewy, sweet and flavorful. Thanks Eric!","1670114704","19"
"123721436","Ron","There is a critical problem with this recipe: it is far too small.  I strongly suggest doubling it.","1678587745","19"
"121811244","dale m","As others have noted the dough may be too stiff to stir in the gochujang mixture as described, but spread just a little on top before baking instead.  I did work some into the dough on the second batch - both ways work well.  I made the cookies a little smaller than recommended.  Probably the most important thing I'll alter next time is to make about half as much of the actual gochujang mixture ... a little goes a long way. Very cool recipe!","1670036703","18"
"121814924","RoLo","Eric Kim's recipes usually feature streamlining when feasible.  Here, you end up only dirtying one bowl - the ingredients are listed in the order they'd best blend together, with flour always going last. I actually make most simple drop cookies and even quick breads and snack cakes this way too, regardless of what the instructions say - everything turns out fine. I love to bake, but I hate washing dishes more.","1670082458","14"
"121831171","alyssa m.","after reading comments, I decided to chill for 10mins, use the back of a spoon to help make ribbons with the caramel mixture and then back in fridge for 5. worked well! also made the cookies as directed but then also with 2tbsp (13mins) and 1 tbsp size scoops (11-12mins) and all came out great","1670180993","14"
"121830289","Brett","Folks who usually reduce the sugar in a recipe, this is not the time to do so. The gochujang brings the heat and you'll need the sugar to maintain that spicy/sweet balance. Also, perhaps spreading out the dough, layering the gochujang sauce, and then pinwheeling cookies would be more aesthetically pleasing; mine turned out not-pretty, but still delicious.","1670177949","12"
"126257942","annabrick","Let me add to the chorus of admirers. This recipe is easy, different, and delicious. The method I used was patting the dough into a rectangle, spreading the gochujang caramel, rolling it up into a log, chilling it, cutting the log into 16 slices (for regular sized cookies), and gently rolling each slice into a ball. Topped with a sprinkle of flake salt. For those of you wanting to make ahead -- I froze the dough balls and then baked them right from the freezer. Turned out perfectly!","1689115926","12"
"121898140","Monica","I’ve made these twice in 24 hours. Yup. They’re that good! But, also because the first time around they didn’t flatten as well. Using a scale to measure the flour was a total game changer. As was ensuring the egg was room temperature! I also forgot to rotate the cookies the first time around. Soooo all those added steps really made a difference!   Run to your kitchen and start baking these!!","1670463125","10"
"121938180","meredith","Be sure to read the ingredients list of the gochujang because ours had garlic and onion and we didn’t realize it until we were almost done with the recipe.","1670705687","10"
"124416777","Sugardoll","Your tastebuds won't know what to make of the flavors at first, then you're addicted. The spiciness is a slow gentle burn. I rolled the dough out flat, refrigerated it to let it firm up, spread on the caramel, then rolled into a log and refrigerated again. I cut thick slices which I rolled into balls, being careful not to mess up the caramel swirl. This technique worked really well, resulting in beautiful dark swirls of chewy gochujang caramel. I made a peanut butter version, even more delicious","1681420835","9"
"121798462","Definitely Recommend!","These cookies were easy and delicious to make,  they're still lovely and soft in the middle the next morning as well. Achieving the swirl after the dough had been refrigerated was a little difficult, so I feel like that could be tweaked, but otherwise a really great riff on a sugar cookie!","1669997814","8"
"121857358","Katie","These are awesome.  A little bit salty, not actually spicy.  Followed the directions exactly except that I haven't been able to find dark brown sugar lately, so used light brown. BTW the gochujang at Trader Joe's is packaged exactly like the product in the Korean grocery.  Also looks, tastes and smells like the authentic stuff.  I'm wondering if they've just put a new label on their small containers.","1670306560","8"
"121951911","LA","If you're going to pull out the ingredients to make these, just go ahead and make a double batch. You'll regret it if you don't.","1670801508","8"
"124035009","Ari H","Truly would rate higher than 5 if I could, these were incredible.  Only note is that they spread a lot, so just be aware that you'll need to space cookies out pretty generously.","1679950080","8"
"121822440","anchovybbt","These are hands down the best cookies I have ever had. So easy to make an a unique but familiar flavor. I can’t get enough.","1670122657","7"
"121937149","Jarid","These are so dang good, but if you prefer a chewier cookie I recommend pulling at the 11 minute mark. I also added an extra egg yolk because I’m a chewy cookie stan, two days later still soft, buttery and chewy","1670700009","6"
"130919009","Lori","I accidentally used Chinese five-spice powder instead of cinnamon yesterday and it’s one of the most serendipitous mistakes I’ve ever made.","1706990440","6"
"121822184","HSK","Way too strong as written. Use maybe half the swirl and completely integrate so the impact is evenly distributed.","1670121002","5"
"121904071","AMyers","These cookies exceeded all expectations and then some! Truly cannot say enough good things. I highly recommend looking up the corresponding YouTube video to get the swirling technique right, as it was very helpful for me. This recipe made 7 large baker style cookies, so I’d recommend doubling if you’re baking for a crowd. I also topped mine with some flaky sea salt. Final note, these were made more beautiful by fully cooling and tasted great even the next day. Thanks for the amazing recipe!","1670519775","5"
"122895646","zg","These are, hands down, the best cookies I have ever made. And I make a lot of cookies","1675141223","5"
"126495311","zg","I’ve made these cookies about 10 times since I found this recipe. They are not only incredibly easy, but they are insanely delicious. Every time I bring them, they are gone in 20 minutes. People who don’t like sweets like these. People who love sweets like these. I took them to a party last night and I had five people ask for the recipe. Make these cookies. You will not be disappointed.","1690049881","5"
"127161847","Mrs. Kim","I bring this recipe to Korea and everyone loves it!!!!1","1692582013","5"
"121788798","alacarte","Given the amount of dough this recipe produced (not a lot) I couldn't figure out how to swirl the gochujang in long circular strokes...so, I did end up overmixing. Next time I will experiment with that. Flavor is still delicious! Also, definitely space the cookies far apart...they spread quite a bit.","1669947025","4"
"121899432","Pam from NJ","A revelation! Perfect as written.","1670469620","4"
"121907838","Otis","Oh. My. Word. You must make these! They are like a Smokey snickerdoodle. For those unfamiliar with it gochujang, it is a slow heat in the way that chipotle can be, but a very different flavor. I couldn’t “swirl” the gochujang in as the recipe indicated, but they came out looking just the same and tasted heavenly. This is not a recipe to miss. Maybe just cook half the dough at a time, or run the risk of eating all the cookies at once. Not that I would know anything about that…..","1670555338","4"
"128731122","Ian","Please be sure to check that your gochujang has no garlic or onion in it - many of them do. These were fairly terrible to both me and my partner, unfortunately.. we love miso cookies, and other experimental / odd flavors but these were a miss.","1698291352","4"
"121822651","EW","This is such an easy, unexpected, and delicious cookie. I will be making again and again!","1670123997","3"
"121907590","Bcha","Dropped using two spoons since we are without the ice cream scoop. The subtle heat and crispy/chewy texture are addicting… I want to keep eating them off the pan as they cool.","1670551552","3"
"121916046","Eric in Boston","The flavor of these cookies is amazing and very unique, however they spread out a LOT in the oven. Even spaced 4""+ apart they still ended up touching. Next time I'm going to put them in the fridge for another half hour after stirring in the gochujang mix.","1670604185","3"
"121993266","Clee525","Daring people will try to make this. Their daring friends & family will eat these and love these. Everyone else: your loss. Followed directions. Turned out perfectly as described.","1670978944","3"
"122059275","Sue","These are incredible. Mine turned out just as the photo and I’m so proud. They look beautiful and taste amazing. Crispy edges, chewy center, just my dream texture in a cookie. Like a spicy little snickerdoodle. But the spice is VERY subtle and perfectly balanced with the cinnamon and vanilla. I cannot recommend these enough!","1671225918","3"
"122177250","Emily","Oh…my god? What is this sorcery? Fantastic cookies. I used vanilla bean paste, high quality salted European butter, and sprinkled with a bit of sea salt after they came out of the oven. Five billion stars.","1671810259","3"
"122201101","zcooks","“These are absurdly good.” And “I’ve never had a cookie like this.”  Just a couple of the comments I’ve gotten after making these. Like the top comment said, make these immediately.","1671985460","3"
"123413281","DaniPancakes","These are ridiculously good cookies! Delicious and unexpected. I’ve made them twice and incorporated a few “lessons learned.” Firstly, swirl the gochujang caramel into the cookie dough before chilling. It will hold the caramel ribbons if done with intention. Secondly, chill much longer than the recipe calls for. First time, 15 minutes…delicious but too thin of a cookie. Second time, 1 hour chill…perfection! They didn’t spread too much and the edges were perfectly crisp, middles chewy! Perfect.","1677305613","3"
"127769985","Edward Lee","As a Korean chef who lived half of my life in Korea, I never thought about putting gochujang to caramel.  This really balances out the sweetness and saltness, and a little bit of a kick at the end from gochujang. I made my own cinnamon, and gochujang butter icing at the end to cover the half side of my cookie, the way I like it. Came out real nice. This is one of the kind, best cookie recipe I've tried in a while. Thanks for giving me new ideas with this recipe.","1694818550","3"
"129395803","emily","Do we think this dough could be frozen in balls?","1701105440","3"
"121900043","Austin D Bowes","These cookies are simply amazing. Every bite of the first cookie brought a smile, and a hunger for the next bite (and next cookie). Friends also felt that it was the best cookie they had ever had—complimenting the cookie more than my own baking skills, for sure. Simple, and brilliant, that the gochujang and brown sugar are mixed so that you taste them together. I’m already planning to make these several more times this month for more friends and more personal midnight snacks.","1670474171","2"
"121906973","mb","because sugar weighs more than flour…","1670541459","2"
"122128334","oldladysadie","Tried these out tonight, and at this point I’ll make any recipe Eric Kim publishes. The cookies have such a warmth to them and are just awesome sugar cookies, with the teeniest bit of heat at the end…amazing. A must-try if you’re even the teeniest bit curious.","1671606921","2"
"122535847","Kim S.","No - gochugaru (pepper flakes) and gochujang (pepper paste) are different.  You will not get the same results and the flakes will not incorporate to make the caramel needed for the recipe. A quick google search shows there is gluten free gochujang available.  Give that a try.","1673559639","2"
"122602221","Eva","Absolutely delicious salty-sweet treat. Don't stress about swirling the gochujang-- even if you overmix they still turn out great.","1673922758","2"
"124233174","Mohsin","Made 9 large cookies with this recipe, which has an absolutely excellent blend of heat and sweetness. I think you can get the aesthetically appealing swirl if you either just dab it on already-scooped dough; or spread and fold like laminating. They do spread dramatically though, so I would either freeze the dough to minimise spread or make them in half the recommended size.","1680727054","2"
"126822835","Lucidity","Eric Kim does it again with a wonderful Korean American flavored recipe. Surprising and distinct! I didn't watch the video in regards to the dolloping and getting in a nice swirl of red. However, I was taken aback by how delicious it tasted! I loved the chewiness and crispy edges. I am keeping this recipe for the rest of my life!","1691370310","2"
"127712876","martym","Overnight, in a sealed container, my cookies turned super crunchy and had none of the chewier in the middle texture I targeted.  Suggestions on where I may have gone wrong or what to tweak?","1694638123","2"
"128282780","Suzanne","This happened to me, too.  A quick hit in the microwave will make them chewy again. I found that just a lid isn’t enough….every time it comes off they are exposed to air. Now, I wrap my cooled cookies in plastic and always squeeze all the air out. But honestly, they get eaten fast!","1696644951","2"
"128311372","cat","Several of my friends think the flavor of these cookies is similar to some Mexican pastries that they love. I’d describe them as spicy snickerdoodles but with the consistency of a chewy lace cookie. Nice. I sprinkled a bit of demerara sugar on top for some crunch.","1696782318","2"
"128711973","Anonymous","I made a few batches of these with gluten free 1:1 flour. They don't rise and crackle the way Eric Kim's did in the video, and I found the texture of the softer parts of the cookies to be too mealy for my taste (that's the gluten free flour's fault, not the recipe's!). But when I cooked them for longer - like 15 minutes - and then transferred them (parchment paper and all) to a rack to cool, they turned out golden and consistently crispy, and absolutely delicious.","1698248305","2"
"129515028","Kate","Can you freeze the dough and bake later?","1701547954","2"
"129779904","sarallisan","I used Trader Joe’s gochujang as I already had a tub languishing in the fridge. Swirling in the “caramel” before chilling worked beautifully. I was extremely apprehensive, but they came out perfect - chewy with crisp edges and a punch of spice at the end. (No hint of garlic or onion in the final cookie). I’m a believer! Next time I’ll try topping with a bit of sea salt or turbinado sugar for a little extra sparkle and crunch. (My toxic trait is that I always want to gild the lily.)","1702516991","2"
"129838368","Pearl","Made these for a bake sale at work and they sold out in 10 minutes. A coworker told me to quit my day job and sell these instead! Make these cookies - you won’t regret it!","1702743487","2"
