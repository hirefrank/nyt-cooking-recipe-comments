"124141780","jacqueline","It’s midnight and I’m a couple drinks in. Because I just got home from a trip I had everything except the Gochujang paste (had to substitute Gochujang sauce, which I know, it says get the paste!). Regardless, it was delicious. I used stale limpy cilantro but I would have preferred scallions, or fresh cilantro. I used somen noodles and they were perfect. Chopped some nuts for crunch/protein and it was a hit. Smashed it.","1680325246","496"
"124139733","ann","Spicy, sweet, delicious, and easy. The one (unintentional) change is we planned to make a full batch of sauce and save half; we promptly forgot and mixed in the half pound of pasta directly. We actually liked the double sauce because the sauce was so good.   Added the pasta to the pan with sauce instead of the opposite. Also not sure it’s a main dish unaccompanied unless it’s midnight and you’re a couple drinks in in which case get after it.","1680309201","391"
"124748212","Max Alexander, Rome, MasterChef Italia","Make the sauce in a skillet. Transfer the cooked pasta directly from the water into the skillet with tongs; the clinging water will thin the sauce about right. If not, add a bit more.   This is how we do it in Italy, where colanders gather dust in the back of the cupboard.","1682766577","364"
"124162820","dimmerswitch","If you want to see Eric Kim make this recipe with ramen noodles instead of spaghetti go to this youtube video and scroll to 10:35.  If you want to have even more fun, watch the entire video for four other great ramen noodle inspirations.  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pFTJN1tF8A"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pFTJN1tF8A</a>","1680452367","335"
"124169399","Jesse & Jen In MSP","Frankly, 1/4 c (i.e. 4 tbsp) honey was too much for us.  The heat was great, and it was perfectly savory, but just had too much sweetness.  We will go with 2 or even 1 tbsp next time.  Green onions as a topper gave the perfect fresh / allium crunch.  Ultimately it was a very tasty recipe, we would just turn down the sweet.","1680490099","271"
"124138825","Marcel","Added a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds and a dash of sesame oil once the noodles were plated. Delish!","1680304676","224"
"124141515","kat","I would follow Eric kim to the ends of the earth. Made this between terrifying tornado storms in the mid-south tonight. Just the right amount of concentration needed to be a welcome distraction. supremely comforting.","1680322404","202"
"124173943","Cathy","This was easy and delicious. If anyone is wondering if it can be made vegan, I substituted maple syrup for honey and Earth Balance for butter and it was perfect.","1680530482","183"
"124156684","Joel P","Super tasty and easy to make. It's got a good amount of heat but adjust gochujang up or down to your preference. As-is was perfect for me, a bit too spicy for my wife. We had it with sliced scallions, as suggested, and after a few bites I chopped up some roasted salted peanuts and threw those on and it really added something so I'd strongly recommend it.","1680403673","157"
"124169482","Sao","I added some mukimame (shelled edamame) to the pasta water at the end of the noodles cooking to add some protein. Also, some matchstick carrots along with the scallions to add crunch. Yum.","1680491250","140"
"124168980","Frankieee","This is such a fabulous twist! I personally recommend using bucatini and leaving the sauce thicker (no pasta water). I added sesame seeds and a small drizzle of sesame oil with scallions. WOWIE! So. Good.","1680484811","98"
"124138414","DG","If I'm going to use some pasta water to enrich the sauce, why not cook the pasta in a smaller amount of water in a skillet, so the pasta starch is more concentrated in the water?","1680302626","96"
"124169473","Kathleen","I'm amazed at the lack of notes describing modifications to this recipe.  Unusual for our crowd (and I'm one that enjoys/appreciates/learns from reading all of the comments and ideas) and a true tribute to Eric Kim.  Looks like this recipe just works and I can't wait to try it!","1680491120","71"
"124165794","Laura G.","The pasta is more likely to be sticky/gluey if it doesn't have a lot of water to roam around in.","1680463284","63"
"124187460","Tracey","We made this and LOVED it! We added raw shrimp when we added the garlic to the butter. Pulled the shrimp once cooked and then added the ingredients to make the sauce, it was excellent and added a little protein.","1680564799","39"
"124174554","Ron A.","It should be noted that gochuchang is sold with varying levels of heat (check the ""thermometer"" that appears on the back label with some brands). I wish this recipe had discussed this and made a recommendation.","1680531695","33"
"125295183","HHK","I made some modifications to this recipe to enhance the “Korean-ness”. First, I replaced the butter with sesame oil. Like butter, sesame oil is low heat fat so it’s important not to use too much heat.   I also added kimchi. I rough chopped a half cup of kimchi, pan fried it until the colour darkened, then added it to the noodles.   Outstanding lunch.","1684940381","29"
"124351505","nina","Seems to me, if you’re supposed to add honey and vinegar to the paste, you may as well use the sauce, which is a lot easier to source. Six of one and a half dozen of the other.","1681222137","23"
"124138093","Joe","I just watched the video on YouTube and immediately made this. What a wonderful take on ramen noodles! I loved it. Thanks!","1680301095","21"
"124141039","Sarah","Made with ramen in a flashest of flashes, no regrets.","1680317551","20"
"124262002","RAH","Before starting, double check the sodium content of your gochujang paste.    You might need to adjust the Step 2 instruction ""...season generously with salt.""","1680830490","20"
"126318199","Hilary","I paired this recipe with Eric Kim’s Korean BBQ Meatball recipe and it was a HIT! Korean spaghetti and meatballs? Yes please!!!","1689346968","19"
"124177016","Sara","Is there a way of doing this with less butter?","1680536774","17"
"124154112","Sam","Made exactly as written and it’s AMAZING! The flavor is great, the sauce is the perfect amount to coat the pasta, and the heat is spot on. 10/10 would recommend.","1680388267","16"
"125473128","Barbara B","Made as is (less honey) the first time, topped w black sesame seeds, yum! 2nd time , used mostly avocado oil (healthier), just 2T butter. Also sautéed diced shiitakes with the garlic. Used Trader Joe’s  ravioli as the  pasta: 1 box each cacao e Pepe,  and sweet corn burrata raviolis. After removing raviolis w a slotted spoon into the gochujang mixture, I cooked some sliced asparagus in the pasta water to tender crisp, drained, mixed that in w ravioli. Garnished w basil slivers. Exceptional!","1685675890","15"
"124224704","Dulcie","Easy and delicious.  I added cooked ground pork and used pappardelle noodles.  Definitely going into the rotation.","1680708121","14"
"124140405","drea","made this tonight and i really liked it. it's a quick low-maintenance meal.","1680313112","13"
"126320238","Dragonflyfarm","When I went to open my gochujang and found it had spoiled, I substituted Sichan broad bean paste in chili oil and it was delicious. I am still waiting to taste the original recipe, but in a emergency, you go with what you have...","1689350532","12"
"130285334","Dog Named Ham","I credit this dish for all endorphins in my brain on the wintry day I made it. In a wasteland of depression and early sunsets and bad news, this was like a miracle that wrapped me up in a giant red sweater (of flavor). I am looking forward to eating the leftovers, though I’m sort of surprised there were any. Thank u ERIC!!","1704580975","12"
"125170884","james","Most groceries have small containers of gochujang paste.   If you don't have it I would make something else.  Niether Sriracha or (gasp) tabasco have the smoky, umami body of gochujang.","1684434366","7"
"126214596","Anneliese","Delicious and satisfying on a rainy Sunday. So nice to be able to make a dish with items already in our pantry, which included Gochujang sauce (rather than paste) and that was just fine.  We skipped the vinegar, added a little honey, and sprinkled with chopped peanuts for crunch. Liked the suggestion from someone here to remove the pasta from the water with tongs and place it in the saucepan. The little bit of starchy water clinging to the hot spaghetti added a silky feel to the sauce. Thanks!","1688934898","7"
"130874900","Susan A.","I love this recipe! I make the single serving and full version all the time, exactly as written.   I also sometimes finish the recipe with a spoon of natural peanut butter instead of butter—and it’s actually ridiculously good.   Between this and the Gochujang Potato Stew, I’ve been craving all things gochujang!","1706819012","7"
"130922211","debinpdx","I’ve cried recently during meals. Both have been meals made from this site and both contained gochujang. There must be a flavor or taste that hits me at my core with the multiple layers here in each bite. My mouth went nuts and I was thinking, wait, why do I taste sweet. I recalled the honey which went in with the vinegar. Amazing combinations of perfect ingredients. The honey I used by the way, came from our very own bees and I had made hot honey using a jalapeño last week.","1707001403","7"
"126824192","Michele","I made this a second time and it’s really delicious. The sauce is so good, I increased the ingredients to 1/3 cup up from 1/4 cup, plus extra butter. It takes a little longer to cook the sauce.  Fish sauce is a must to cut the sweetness of the honey, and using a whole bunch (about 5) green onions, and a whole bunch of cilantro, really rounds out the flavor, not to mention adding a little green to the dish. Stand out recipe for sure!","1691377557","6"
"129679029","Brandy","I have made this once a week since I discovered this recipe 9 months ago--it is so delicious and easy. High quality honey and sherry vinegar make all the difference, I've found--the flavor of sweetness depends so much on what your local honey tastes like. I always top with the scallions. Great comfort food!","1702208169","6"
"130615444","Jim","Made this tonight - looked at the linguini and spaghetti noodles in my pantry, and just couldn’t do it.  Had an expiring package of Chinese egg noodles, so used that instead.  Grabbed a bunch of rather sorry looking veggies (mushroom, zucchini, onion, daikon radish) out of the fridge, chopped them up, sautéed them, made the sauce, tossed it all together with the noodles - pretty tasty!  Reminded me of Pad Thai - next time I’ll use rice noodles, lime juice instead of vinegar, top with peanuts.","1705901104","5"
"126538711","riff it up bebe","PORK BELLY!!!","1690257379","4"
"129942077","Ron H.","Delicious but felt more like a side dish than a main. Needs a bit more umami to round it out. Might experiment by adding roasted mushrooms or a poached egg. Also, 1/4 cup honey felt a touch too much as well.","1703132373","4"
"130443272","Delicious","Used 4 Tbs of avocado oil instead of butter and forgot to add the additional 2 tbs. Still turned out great but was a little dry so next time will use all the oil/butter recommended. Followed recommendation to add crushed salted peanuts in addition to scallions. That was a great addition. Used less honey as recommended by some (used 1 tbsp). Had to add sugar to balance things out so next time will use 2 tbsp of honey. Also added frozen edamame to pasta near the end of cooking time. Amazing.","1705199819","4"
"131262703","elborealis","Made this tonight.  Really good.  I added a splash of light soy sauce at the end which filled my need for a little more salt.  Also cut the honey by a bit, maybe half, just my preference.   Served with Sauteed Bok Choy a la Sam Sifton.  Great counterpart.   I am ducking as I say that next time I might try half gochujang and half doubanjiang in the mix.   I was wanting some earthiness, but that's just me.  Something different from original recipe intent, but fun to try.","1708308792","4"
"131467922","Alli","It isn't midnight and I'm 0 drinks in, but it is Tuesday and the rest of the family is out for the evening which means there's no one to complain about a spicy dinner.  Quick, easy, absolutely delicious.  I used cilantro and next time will serve witj shrimp to make a complete meal.  For me tonight, just a bowl of noodles was completely perfect.","1709077529","4"
"129445652","Jenny","Don’t hate me, but I added about 1/4 cup of heavy cream to cut the spice. I thought it was deeeelish.","1701283251","3"
"130764568","H","Better with some sautéed tomatoes added to the sauce and allowed to cook down.","1706454777","3"
"131082466","Mary Orsini","While the gochujang has an unusual and pleasant flavor I'll have to say that this recipe is the most overrated recipe I've ever made from NYT...especially when you consider you've squandered 6 Tsp of butter.  There is just no there there.  There are so many wonderful Asian noodle dishes out there and they are all better than this.","1707592717","3"
"131239420","Amy","This was delicious! I did use a bit less honey because of the previous comments. I also hydrated some dried shiitakes while the water was coming to a boil; sliced and added to the sauce just before adding the pasta and WOW, those are good! They really soaked up the flavors and added a nice textural element. Yum.","1708194669","3"
"124818304","Katie","Gochujang varies widely not only in spice and salt levels but also in sugar content. It might be worth checking out a different brand for this recipe- or reducing the amount of honey you use. Just a thought!","1683085758","2"
"130182039","Ben","Amazing, no notes except only that we should get more solo serving suggestions. That alone made this super clutch.","1704252427","2"
"131025593","Joanne","Could you make this using olive oil instead of butter?","1707416031","2"
"131029449","Beth B","Hmm...so we should avoid gochujang sauce because it has sugar and vinegar....and then add honey and vinegar?","1707426161","2"
"132373365","Helen","I could not find gochujang paste at all in any of my grocery stores (I'm in Montana!). I don't know if gochujang sauce is stronger or weaker, but I would just say go easy because you can always add more later. The first time I made this it was inedible (my fault), but the last two times, these noodles were positively addictive. I attribute to going a little easy on the spice until you get exactly what you want. Thank you Eric Kim for a wonderful recipe.","1712457351","2"
"135077108","AK","This dish is amazing. I've made it a couple of times and my favourite swaps are: soba for spaghetti, maple syrup for honey (and less than it calls for), tossed with sesame oil, addition of sesame seeds, green onions,  and air fried tofu. Next time I'll add some veggies like edamame, baby spinach, match stick cucumbers...maybe daikon, mushrooms or radish. Def one of the  best meals of all time.","1722371075","2"
