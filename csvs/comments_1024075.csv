"125714994","Becky Home-ecky","I need enlightening, what is Chile crisp? Where do I find it? ( what stores and what aisle?) Also where do I find crispy shallots? Is it something like the old fashioned onion crisps?","1686756356","491"
"125714628","Kayla","Any recommendations for the best frozen dumplings?","1686755620","277"
"125995025","ProblemChild","Nothing about this recipe should work but the dish all of these unexpected flavor combinations create is astonishingly delicious. I'm going to be making this all summer long. PS: Don't mess with the ingredients or proportions because you think you know better. You don't. Make this as written. You'll be so glad you did.","1687992661","205"
"125715921","Ellen Morrison","Trader Joe’s dumplings are all good. I also like most dumplings labeled “gyoza”, preferring that style bc I lived in Japan. Ajinomoto is a good brand.","1686757998","184"
"125899656","Anneliess Lush","Recipe for crispy fried shallots if you can't find in store: 3 shallots sliced thin 1/2 cup of vegetable oil Combine shallots and oil in medium bowl. Microwave for 5 min. Stir and continue to microwave 2 min longer. Repeat stirring and microwaving in 2-minute increments until beginning to brown (4 to 6 min). Repeat stirring and microwaving in 30-second increments until deep gold brown (30 sec to 2 min). Using slotted spoon, transfer to paper towel–lined plate, season with salt, drain for 5 min","1687550592","167"
"125725548","Anna","I love the Asian flavor of this dish.  I think I may try an Italian version with mini cheese ravioli.  Throw in a bit of pesto, good olive oil, olives, capers, grilled red peppers, and fresh ground pepper to taste.  More ideas are popping into my head, but I will stop riffing now!","1686778044","165"
"125714654","Tammy","Question about using/measuring chile crisp: Should I stir it up and then measure out a tablespoon, so that I get a mixture of the solid bits with the oil? Or does one tablespoon mean one tablespoon of just the oil? TIA","1686755672","134"
"125719140","Steve H","I love Chili Crisp. Our local store has Momofuku Chili Crunch, which is good, but my favorite is Fly-by-Jing. It has just the right amount of heat (not too much) and is also not too salty.","1686763770","108"
"125703515","Kaydee","Wow, this looks like a quick meal with many possibilities! Looking forward to trying it. Vegetable pot stickers, here I come! Maybe some wilted spinach thrown in and will opt for low sodium soy sauce or tamari.","1686705195","104"
"125716240","janet","Trader Joe’s frozen potstickers are excellent.","1686758570","91"
"125717904","Megan S.","Lao Gan Ma is my favorite brand, if your town has a asian grocery, you may be able to find there, looks like it is also sold on amazon (at a markup). I buy it in Chinatown. Trader Joe's has a chili garlic crunch oil that I do not like as much, and Fly By Jing has a chili crisp that can be found it looks like at Target, as well as online.","1686761526","81"
"125720266","Jane","I made this for lunch immediately after it was posted. I bought Mr. Bing chili crisp. I had “ROSTAD LÖK” fried onions from Ikea. I used the chicken cilantro mini wontons from Trader Joe’s. It was delicious. It is a great way to use up leftover or slightly past due tomatoes and basil. It also is one of the juiciest meals ever. It made an exquisite “sauce” that was designed to be sopped up with good bread. Long live the juice.","1686765899","70"
"125716921","Claudia","Someone asked about gnocchi - I think Korean rice cakes would also be awesome here","1686759846","64"
"125718048","Kirsti","It's a Chinese condiment made with crispy onion, chile and sesame suspended in oil. Adds an earthy kick.  Find it in supermarkets in the Asian products aisle.","1686761768","56"
"125721903","Brian S.","Chile crisp is a Chinese condiment that has become very trendy and popular over the past decade.  There are many versions: one that is very popular and accessible/easy to buy (at least for me in CA) is Lao Gan Ma brand. It is a mildly spicy, oil-based condiment that is deep red and contains chile pieces, Szechuan peppercorns, and scallion cooked until deeply savory.  It adds a hit of umami and heat.  Note Lao Gan Ma brand carries many different sauces: Spicy Chili Crisp is what you seek.","1686769453","34"
"126073758","Mahiwema","I made this the other night, when I had almost no energy left to think about dinner. It was very good, and so easy. Next time I’ll dial back the chili crisp, and maybe add a chopped up peach. Peaches go well with tomatoes and basil, and they’d add a nice sweet element to the dish.","1688321165","27"
"125829381","Cynthia Witter","Well friends, I made this tonight. It may or may not be relevant that I’m 71 years old. It’s tasty but exceedingly hot. Next time I’d use half the chili crisp and twice the vinegar and soy.","1687305629","20"
"125715654","Lobster","Love it! Bibigo beef and veg dumplings (bought from hmart) go really well this recipe!","1686757549","19"
"125742503","Laura","Use care when pan-frying frozen dumplings. I have learned the hard way that they splatter violently!","1686842670","19"
"125718443","fried shallot resource","Bottled fried shallots (and fried garlic) can be found at your local Asian grocery store or international market. Try them this Thanksgiving on your green bean casserole, too!","1686762448","18"
"125715196","area runner","STIR IT UP! IMO -  you want the texture from the chile crisp.","1686756730","17"
"125996539","PSS","This recipe was a miss for me. I had beautiful local heirloom tomatoes, basil from my garden, and all the other ingredients. I cut the recipe in half for two of us, but otherwise followed it exactly. While I like all these ingredients individually, they just didn’t seem to come together into something special. I probably will not make this again.","1687998099","12"
"125722529","Chuck Cairns","Can you substitute gnocchi for the dumplings?","1686770888","11"
"129668081","Susan","FABULOUS!!  I made this exactly as written but did not think that the fresh basil added anything so I've left it out since then.  I've probably made this 15 times since I discovered it.  I've also started keeping a small jar of the sauce in the fridge to pour onto halved cherry tomatoes for a mid-afternoon snack...no dumplings just sauce and tomatoes.","1702144700","10"
"125718618","Patriciact","Where do I find crispy fried Shallots?","1686762743","9"
"125738877","Ellen GF","Feel Good Foods (available @ Walmart & Target) makes gluten free potstickers in the frozen foods section.","1686836928","7"
"125981736","Carol","This was fantastic. I bought veggie dumplings at Trader Joes as others recommended and because I didn't have time to make a 40 mile round trip to HMart, which would have been my preference. I made my own chili crisp, which was great. Nothing negative about this recipe. I will note that if you're not going to eat the entire dish at one time to leave the dumplings out as they will get soggy sitting in the dressing.","1687961576","7"
"126550056","Johnny Wokit","I made this recipe as per instructed on the first go and found it to be delicious. On my second try I substituted Doubanjiang for the chili crisp because I dislike chili crisp’s gritty texture. I also wanted it to be more like a salad so I let the dumplings cool before tossing with tomatoes, crunchy romaine, cucumber and a bit of cilantro along with the basil. I highly recommend Bibigo chicken cilantro wantons for this recipe.  They can be found at Costco.","1690307043","7"
"126608754","Chris","Agree that salting the tomatoes early pulls out too much liquid and overwhelms the dressing. I preferred to salt at the end or just up the soy sauce.","1690501912","5"
"134184899","Leslie Mignault","Where are there ""summer tomatoes"" right now?","1719501944","5"
"134672471","Kat","I ... am so confused by these reviews. I've never left a comment on a recipe here before, but we were so blown away by how bad this was that I had to. It has all of my favorite ingredients, but combined, this was a flavorless tomato chile oil soup, with seemingly random dumplings. I'm sad I wasted so many beautiful heirloom tomatoes on this.","1720979360","5"
"125920676","JT","This was just a bougie version of dumplings that we eat all the time, at home and at restaurants, here in Japan and probably throughout most of Asia. The ""vinaigrette"" is literally a combination of the things you see on any ramen shop counter; everyone eats their dumplings with a combination of soy sauce, vinegar, and chili oil (though typically just straight oil, no crunchy bits). All this recipe did was eliminate a second plate for a salad!","1687690833","4"
"126135219","Emma","Ok but after making this recipe twice now, it’s probably gonna be a go-to (Especially with farmers market tomatoes and frozen veggie dumplings from my local dumpling shop!) As someone who struggles to eat traditional salads I highly recommend this one. Super easy and tasty.","1688604124","4"
"126262527","Karen NBvW","A BJs fav is their Pot Stickers by Bibigo!  Been buying these vegan potstickers full of whole soy beans & plenty protein for some time!  Fav in winter over charred cabbage, in spring when lots of beautiful lettuce but not much to go w'it for salads, and NOW how to make high summer tomatos a meal unto themselves! YES!","1689157232","4"
"126363708","Marne Carmean","I did make the vinaigrette first and added a little honey about a teaspoon.                               Don't set aside tomatoes for long, if at all, because you will have a soup. If there is a next time  for me I will steam the dumplings/pot stickers first and they can cool down. Then cut up tomatoes and quite immediately add the dumplings and wash all with  the dressing.","1689570756","4"
"126802718","Mariel R","Loved this - note to use a very solid chilli crisp next time (more crisp than oil!) as the soy and vinegar loosen the dressing up a lot. I’d like to try this with maybe noodles added - unsure of cold or not - to satisfy my double carb obsession.  Very tasty and fresh but still deeply satisfying. Perfect hangover food.","1691267238","4"
"127232817","Jed","A fun change of pace, when - and this is critical - you have really juicy-tasty tomatoes lying around that need to be eaten, because the tomatoes make this or break this.  I made this once with not-quite-there tomatoes, and it did.not.work.  Also easy to improve on with other salad vegetables, such as onions or hearty greens.","1692837202","3"
"129704174","AA","This was delicious, but I found the amount of tomatoes to be disproportionate. I would have been happy with half of the recommended 2.5 pounds.","1702312809","3"
"134183924","KDA","I've made this a few times and we're addicted to the dressing! Cucumbers make a good addition if you have some on hand.","1719500575","3"
"135027103","Instant Pothead","Overwhelms the dumplings, and doesn't go with every dumpling flavour.","1722194926","3"
"134175499","Julie","I thought this sounded weird but I wanted to give it a try because of all the good reviews. It did not work for me unfortunately. The tomatoes/basil/garlic is good on it's own. The dumplings and sauce are good on their own. I ended up separating everything and saving the tomato mixture for a caprese.","1719460405","2"
