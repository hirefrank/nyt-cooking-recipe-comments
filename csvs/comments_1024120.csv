"124531444","Jennie","I know we are all thinking this…what alcohol would pair best to make this an adult beverage?","1681918115","548"
"124548894","Big Talulah","Ok we made this and it was delicious albeit quite messy… my brother in law then proceeded to just mix storebought limeaid with condensed milk and zested a lime over top, poured it over crushed ice and it was, dare I say better??","1681984739","188"
"124537226","Anne","I am thinking of using cream of coconut rather than condensed milk and adding RUM for an adult indulgence.","1681929523","167"
"124540296","Siri C","I have lived in Rio de Janeiro. Brazil for 40  years and have never heard of adding sweetened condensed milk (aka “Leite Moça”) to Limonada Suíça. We blend the cut up line with sugar or sweetener, water and ice and serve in a tall glass with a straw. Very refreshing on a hot day!","1681936346","166"
"124532389","Kriss","Or cachaca, Brazilian rum.","1681919772","95"
"124569539","Mayanne","I have never heard of this luscious offering and the idea of whirring whole limes seemed crazy. And, I'm not a fan of sweetened condensed milk, which to me seems fake and cloying. BUT, this was wonderful. Tart, sweet, light, refreshing. Thank you for sharing!","1682039953","86"
"124531773","Jake Romero","This would be a fantastic party punch with silver rum, vodka, or tequila!!!!","1681918672","65"
"124533913","Aloisio","If you want to pair it with alcohol, ditch the condensed milk and add cachaça from Brazil and you have a caipirinha like drink","1681922387","56"
"124548264","Emo","I peel half the limes, and the white stuff on the wedges, as you would for a caipirinha, otherwise its too bitter--Amy, try with half-peeled limes and see. As for it keeping for 3 days, well, I guess technically it does, but it might be undrinkable by then: the longer it sits, the bitterer it gets. In Brazil, we make it and serve it, since no one likes ""limonada azeda""!","1681976585","46"
"124542874","Gage","Made exactly as recipe states. The first glass fresh out of the blender was great, but as it set in the refrigerator it seemed to become much more bitter. Next time I might peel some of the limes to avoid extra bitterness. Also an extra lime or two would be great if you like it more sour.","1681943777","33"
"124547449","Frank","But the song says you put the lime in the coconut, not the other way around!  Seriously though I will try this since I'm not a fan of too much sweetness.  I have been buying Outshine Lime and Coconut popsicles lately and this will scratch both itches.","1681964866","25"
"124531903","Tara","Coconut milk or cream and honey?","1681918937","24"
"124548222","Emo","Yes, and it was a disaster; limes bounced around and water spilled out the sides. When it was all done I was left with a mess and no limonada. BTW, condensed milk is certainly optional--plenty of limonodas suíças are made with sugar, and it's more refreshing that way on a hot day. And yes, it is delicious mixed with cachaça.","1681975909","20"
"124538143","ekelly","Gin and lime, that’s a great combo.","1681931671","18"
"124532128","Morgan","I am using Nature's Charm Sweetened Condensed Coconut Milk, but regular sugar.  Monk Fruit, agave syrup, or honey may be a good sub.","1681919330","12"
"124602417","Chickenfog","This nicely cuts into 1/4 for a single serving. I microplaned the lime then juiced it and ditched the sugar. Delish! Will make again.","1682186525","12"
"124541516","expatinMelb","Has anyone tried this is a food processor? I don’t have a blender in my kitchen but would love to try this!","1681939783","11"
"124541012","DRK","I agree with cachaca but also think Pisco would be great.","1681938227","9"
"125143714","Ann","This was ok, but I probably won’t make it again. What I WILL make again is the Orange Julius I made this morning. I peeled 4 oranges and blended them with 2 cups of water, 2 cups of ice, and the other half can of sweetened condensed milk I had leftover. Delicious!","1684342985","8"
"124537798","Amy","Turned out to be extremely bitter. Made the recipe as written but it was unpleasant.","1681930806","7"
"124540580","Marisa","coconut condensed milk or oat condensed milk would be a better substitute.","1681937104","7"
"124677618","Mateus","Do not refrigerate for up to 3 days. After 3 hours (30 min?) it is already extremely bitter because of the rinds. This should be drunk ASAP. Also, just as a curiosity, the sweetened condensed milk as a sweetener is something of a regional variation within Brazil. Most brazilians would tell you that the difference between regular lemonade vs ""swiss"" lemonade is squeezing the limes vs blending whole limes.","1682509886","6"
"124531262","Melinda","likely not, it would probably curdle because of the limes","1681917793","5"
"125417154","Cassie","Made recipe as is but replaced one cup of water with 1 cup cachaça. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Super refreshing, not too sweet.","1685476381","4"
"124554519","Douglas Chapman","I use oatmilk and more sugar or maple syrup: just as delicious.","1682000410","3"
"124608154","Santi-YES","Really good, I was worried it was going to be too sweet but it was perfect, not too sweet not too sour.   Have you tried a salty Vietnamese limeade?","1682215595","3"
"124534133","Patricia","sometimes we (Brazilians) will use ""Leite Moça"" (condensed mild) as a sweetener in Caipirinha and it is really good.  So, I would say Vodka or Pinga.","1681922822","2"
