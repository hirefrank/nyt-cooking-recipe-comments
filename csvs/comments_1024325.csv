"126013170","LisaM","Sounds like a fancy version of my go-to red wine spritzer: dry red wine + Fresca + a good squeeze of fresh lime, over ice. It’s really refreshing!","1688062428","139"
"126027024","Lena","Original tinto de verano doesn't have any syrup, lime or salt. Just red wine, La Casera (original or lemon taste), a lemon slice and ice. It doesn't require prep, it is done on the go.  Proportions will change depending on taste (more or less wine, etc). A touch of vermouth is only done is some parts of the country (I don´t fancy that one as much, is less refreshing in my opinion). Many times simpler is better.","1688110880","122"
"126047018","Elizabeth","If you’d like to prevent it from getting watered down, add frozen grapes instead of ice cubes.","1688159787","92"
"126020106","Amy Maricle","I spent a couple of happy summers in Sevilla Spain. In the bars there they always made it simply with a dry, red wine, and either lemon or lime Fanta and ice. Very simple and very delicious.","1688078040","85"
"126013593","PB","I’ve made something similar to this for many years! I like to use San Pellegrino or the Italian lemon sodas (should just be soda, no cream or anything) sold at Trader Joe’s or most grocery stores as they’re less sweet and more “citrusy” to me. If it’s still feeling too sweet I’ll sometimes squeeze lemon in or cut it with a bit of club soda","1688063201","80"
"126050793","jojo banana","very VERY tasty.  I’m completely blitzed on this getting pizza right now, but I have been chasing down this cocktail since I was slinging them in the north of Spain for a year.  I made the simple syrup with the intent to use it tonight, but ended up topping the ménage a trois red and sweet vermouth with half a can of sprite.  I pre froze the wine glass before serving and garnished with a lemon slice and I’m pretty sure this is my new EVERY DAY cocktail.  10/10 thank you NYT!","1688172022","78"
"126054628","Thomas Anderson","Have spent many summer months in Spain and never saw such a complicated Tinto de verano. Just buy a high-quality lemon soda like San Pellegrino or the excellent lemon soda that they sell at Aldi and mix with red wine and ice.  This is my go-to summer drink.","1688215844","52"
"126016030","Tracey","I have been making a lighter, less sweet version of this for years now. Dry Spanish red wine with lemon seltzer and a good squeeze of lemon. I don’t miss the sweetener (although if I did, I’d probably just add a splash of the regular simple syrup I keep on hand).","1688068599","48"
"126038235","Miriam","I also opt for an Italian soda—the lemon one from Trader Joe’s is a great, tart, not-overly sweet option! Would also highly recommend trying this with grapefruit soda!","1688143840","36"
"126050692","eaalice","How do you think this would go with Fever Tree Sparkling Sicilian Lemonade?","1688171649","32"
"126050181","Oscar Rollán","Being from Spain, I have been drinking this for many years. This a simple and yet refreshing drink. All you need is some normal red wine, lemon fanta (unfortunately not available in the US), ice and a slice of lemon. I am still looking for a lemon soda close enough, but I have not found it yet. But I am still looking and trying different lemon sodas.","1688169704","31"
"126020763","TM","Seconding PB's recommendation - I've been doing this with Trader Joe's sparkling lemonade for years now! With or without the extra alcohol, and always over ice. Even friends who hate red wine will drink a tinto de verano.","1688080005","21"
"126044366","AC","Ice, 3/4 red wine, 1/4 orange soda. Perfection.","1688154135","21"
"126062469","Richard","Did you read that the lemon/lime syrup is optional? Otherwise it's ice, red wine and soda.. again with optional vermouth. Nothing complicated.","1688243873","17"
"126050852","Kim","Following up on my note, I tried both the sprite and homemade lemon lime syrup/club soda and liked them both. The sweet vermouth came through with more nuance and complexity than the sprite but both delicious and colorful. Perfect for a fair summer evening.","1688172261","9"
"126070839","D","Any type if red you want. Nothing expensive because you'll be adding a soda to it .","1688312259","4"
"126115643","Gracias","For those about to add to the comment section just to say ‘when I was in Spain they used …’  go ahead and read the intro paragraph and save yourself some time.","1688510768","4"
"126240963","Paisley","I made the simple syrup today and let it steep. I used only lemons because I have a tree. To make the drink, I used the proportion of wine and syrup given without sweet vermouth and topped with San Pellegríno. It was delicious. I drank 3 of them and still only had 6 ounces of wine—great for a hot day.  You could certainly use whatever lemon lime soda you have available in the absence of the Spanish one, but the lemony sweet of the syrup was delightful And did not mask the taste of the wine.","1689058919","4"
"126556027","Sally Peabody","I've spent a lot of time in Seville. While this recipe looks fine and delicious, in Seville they use a large tumbler type glass, put in about 1/3 hearty red, fill with club soda or a lemony soda, add a slice of orange and ice. That's it.. A very basic spritz but lovely and refreshing and absolutely no fuss. Of course works with a nice dry inexpensive white wine too.","1690318686","3"
"126023947","Sam","This is REALLY GOOD. Just make it.","1688090510","2"
"126373601","Miguel Gomez","Casera is much closer to sweetened tonic water than to 7up. This version of tinto de verano is more like the variety made with lemon Fanta or Schweppes soda. They are two distinct varieties.","1689611884","2"
"126965737","Mary W.","The whole point of this drink is to keep it simple. If you can’t find the Casera in the US, my Spanish friends recommend cutting up “summer fruit”—stone fruit, fresh crushed berries—to add to Tempranillo in a pitcher and offering Wegmans Frizzante Sicilian Lemon Soda so people can adjust their drink to taste.","1691836137","2"
"132640610","Lady Di","I make my Spanish sangria with Squirt. It’s the closest thing I have found to Fanta de Limón which is what they used for sangria and tinto de verano in the 90’s when I studied at the University of Seville. We don’t get lemon Fanta in the U.S. (though I foundnit once at a Polish grocer in Chicago in the early 2000’s), and I don’t know where to find Kas.","1713488490","2"
