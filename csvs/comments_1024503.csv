"128110096","cd1600","I have been making this for years.  I pound my chicken cutlets and by the time it’s done they’re are falling apart tender.  I add a lot more broth and thicken it with the flour from the chicken.  I also add a half pound of cooked pasta and a lot of raw baby spinach at the end - it melts from the heat and makes this a true one pot meal.  I always have enough for at least 2 nights!!","1696092175","903"
"128134558","amanda v","Made this tonight. Didn’t have cream so used whole milk and some flour to thicken. We don’t like SDT so I used a can of petite diced tomatoes drained and it was delicious. Served it over rice. Was very good, easy and came together quickly. Marry me tho? Maybe not lol. Sleep with me, maybe haha.","1696205726","639"
"128119037","Souad Sharabani","You don't need to use that much oil & butter to make this dish, 1/2 the amount is sufficient . You can also use milk, or coconut milk instead of cream","1696152282","482"
"128160401","Ash","Add a finely diced shallot when you add the garlic, you won’t regret it.","1696287793","435"
"128208327","Curt Conklin","In college we used to joke that every fella needed to know how to make a creamy chicken dish for serving a first-time dine-over date. It didn't matter the recipe, but we all called it Chicken Seducto. This qualifies!","1696434497","403"
"128105618","Degustibus Dan","Deglaze with a shot (or two) of vodka after cooking the tomato paste (double that too) and the dish becomes pretty classic vodka sauce.","1696078804","352"
"128104658","Donna","Wondering if you could use greek yogurt instead of heavy cream to cut back on the fat content?","1696075428","259"
"128256387","Katie","This recipe nearly caused a divorce in my household as my boyfriend got so mad at the amount of oil I had splattered everywhere. Also I used chicken thighs as it was the only thing I had in the fridge. Frankly the outcome was a little gross, between the fattiness of the thighs and the creaminess of the sauce. I know, none of this is the fault of the recipe, but I guess my advice is don't use thighs and get a boyfriend who doesn't hover over you while you cook.","1696564438","231"
"128124918","Lindsay","Sub the dairy for sour cream, add some onions, serve it with spaetzle or other dumpling and you’ve got chicken paprikash. Yes, my spouse we would remarry me for this.","1696173058","230"
"128209360","Stephanie T","This was really good, and the leftovers reheated well and made a great lunch! I did make some modifications based on some notes. After browning the chicken, I sautéed some mushrooms until nicely browned, removed from pan and then sautéed some finely diced shallots and garlic until soft. Added the tomato paste and after a few minutes deglazed with a splash of vodka. once that cooked off, I added the broth and followed the rest of recipe, adding the mushrooms along with the chicken in that step.","1696436018","187"
"128139938","Christina","As a newlywed, my first dish was this! I added extra red pepper flakes for more heat, and doubled the amount of sun dried tomatoes for extra tangy-ness. I also threw some basil into the sauce after removing the pan from heat, as well as extra for garnish. Came out great!","1696249858","115"
"128115667","steve rayman","Threw some vermouth in to deglaze the pan.","1696114655","95"
"128095177","JG in Florence","I made this as written. It was very tasty and the whole family enjoyed it, and I liked the overall technique in the recipe.  The sauce was yummy mopped  up with bread. That said, I doubt me or my partner would have been impressed by this kind of food. Butter, cream and parmesan on chicken is rich. It's good, but if we want to splurge, we'd rather do it  on something  else!","1696018001","74"
"128165403","SophiaSprinkles","So if it’s like a curry but without spices and with sun dried tomatoes, it’s nothing like a curry. *shrugs*","1696298197","61"
"128235755","Vetty","Great recipe The principles used in this recipe can be applied to others. Pound chicken cutlet. Make sure meat is dry. Coat in flour and shake off excess. Sauté in olive oil. Add liquid and spices. Put on low to thicken. For chicken Marsala, add mushrooms and use Marsala wine instead of milk/chicken stock. For chicken piccata, add white wine and lemon juice. Throw in some capers.","1696518373","50"
"128116432","beepboop","I always put toasted garlic breadcrumbs on top, with a little bit of cumin. It's my version of curry not curry!","1696119356","45"
"128126578","Martin B","Servings are based on weight. About 2 lbs is 4 servings, 1/2 lb each.  Cutting a sandwich in half doesn’t mean you have 2 sandwiches.","1696176804","41"
"128218390","Karen","I made this very same recipe but with salmon filets and my husband asked  me to marry him  ten  days later. It was our first supper together.","1696451853","35"
"128131979","Johan Z.","And why would there be a need for 4 servings in the first place?  ""Marry me chicken"" does rather imply a tete-a-tete dinner.  Unless you've invited 3 potential beaux (or belles) and you intend to snap up the first to utter those words.  Sounds like a fun party!","1696193735","31"
"128301144","Gary","It’s Marry Me Chicken when being served and eaten but becomes Divorce Me Chicken for the clean up.","1696722896","29"
"128166157","Barbara","Rave reviews on this one from family. I added 8 oz sliced mushrooms and a chopped onion. Less butter and just 2 tablespoons of half and half (what I had). Carmelizing that tomato paste really adds deep flavor.","1696300395","28"
"128149644","Jeanne","Made this exactly as written (I measured and everything!) and it was absolutely delicious.  I'm going to try the sauce with other dishes/preparations because it is to die for.","1696267393","26"
"128202952","cauliflower","For meals like this, I serve over cauliflower. I grew up on pasta everything...but I find the fluffy texture of cauliflower gives more focus to the main dish. I simply steam the fresh cut up cauliflower until cooked well; drain, dump in the serving bowl and chop up with a knife or two (shhh....sometimes I do it right in the steamer pan).","1696426712","23"
"128102180","Laurie","I also wondered about the number of servings. If the chicken breasts are large (as they so often are these days), this should easily serve six.","1696043451","22"
"128276371","DejanK","I also have been making this for decades - original, as I learned it, called for garlic, mustard and sour cream, trust me to die for - but the basic principle is that the meat is almost done as it is fried and that the sauce thickens from the flour used on golden-browning the meat. You could do this with different kinds and cuts of meat - cubed pork tenderloin, veal scallopini, boneless thighs, duck breast, etc. - and with different flavors and liquids - stock, heavy cream - for the sauce.","1696621004","21"
"128159226","andrea","Did whole can of tomato paste with double garlic, chicken stock, one cup cream, subs dreid tomatoes   Also did chicken thighs","1696285052","20"
"128213395","susan stevens","You can use evaporated milk from a can:  much lower fat......maybe after the wedding.  Also, I make variations of this dish with chicken breasts on the bone--much healthier and better flavor.  I removed the skin but keep the bones.......also after the wedding.","1696442458","15"
"128217782","StellaP","I love this recipe! For next time, I would be more liberal with salt and pepper rubbed all over chicken before coating with flour and frying.  I did not have time to get sun-dried tomatoes. So instead, I slow roasted half a container of grape tomatoes ( near death!) 320F for 20~30mins (during prep time). Was great!","1696450715","14"
"128202602","AF","Absolutely blown away by this. MAKE IT!!!!","1696426174","12"
"128162701","Cats4Lyfe","Made this with Country Crock plant cream to make it mostly dairy free (although I did add Parmesan) and it was delicious. The cats came out from under the bed to bask in the smells. Will definitely be making again.","1696292023","11"
"128106316","Julia M","My son must be coming to dinner.","1696080808","10"
"128552585","Sue Fisher","This was amazing. After 35 years of marriage, I wasn't sure whether my husband wanted to renew our vows or just marry the chicken.","1697672991","10"
"128134496","Punque Roc","It's not the same as Chicken Paprikash - what about the paprika??","1696205345","7"
"128159217","Pam from NJ","Fabulous. May have added a bit more chopped sundried tomatoes and leftover pasta sauce instead of the paste. Mister loved it, gonna seal the deal with this one ;)","1696285033","6"
"128271392","Rick","This'll be even better with boneless thighs, which IMHO have more flavor than breasts.  And in any case, the marriage boat sailed a long time ago!","1696610326","6"
"128477684","Wow!","This recipe is excellent! We subbed boneless skinless thighs for the breasts and coconut milk for the heavy cream. Amazing!!","1697410919","6"
"128856047","Kris","Marry me (again)?  “Why, yes,” he said - after 35 years.  Followed the recipe to the letter and it was sublime.","1698793726","5"
"128938009","Gayle W.","Made this last night. Followed the recipe, but added a shallot along with the garlic per one suggestion. Absolutely delicious and easy. My husband of 23 years said he'd marry me again.","1699100136","5"
"129715458","Morgan","I have made this as written replacing the heavy cream with cashew cream that I made from soaked raw cashews. I still use the butter. It’s still so so decadent and my husband wants to have this every week. Oh yeah - I added the minced shallot as another reviewer suggested and it was a great addition.","1702333412","5"
"131045770","Nawal","I had guests over for dinner and made this dish. Such a hit! Everyone wanted to know what was in it. Simple to cook, instructions are clear and it came together beautifully! I doubled the stock amount in order to make it more saucy. Definitely one of the dishes to include in your 'marry me' cooking repetoire!","1707486495","4"
"132702432","Florrie","Glad I read tips from others before cooking. I added half a shallot when I added garlic. Also I reduced the cream and parmesan a bit so it was less creamy and more tomato -focused.  This came out amazing- 5/5, will definitely be making this again.","1713748480","4"
"128134532","Punque Roc CA","In much the same way a quiche resembles an omelette... minus the obvious differences.","1696205573","3"
"128464973","WW","This is a glommy version Penang curry chic, Horrible and not worth tweaking as I have tried.","1697338134","3"
"128789103","g sum","I don't know know if this would really get you a second date. There much tastier versions of this dish out there.","1698520701","3"
"129604320","Nancy","Add more Parm and tomato paste....it's wonderful","1701913547","3"
"131038134","Alexandra","Used chicken thighs (boneless) Added 1 onion & 2 shallots with garlic Added thyme with oregano  Reduced with vodka & broth  Baked for 20 min @ 375 to finish","1707445272","3"
"130048327","Ross","This was great. Made it pretty much exactly as described other than eyeballing the butter and olive oil and a little heavier on the parm, but it had a great flavor and heats up well, too.   It took a minute or two more than estimated for the stock to reduce and then sauce to thicken.  Served it over rice with a side of roasted broccoli","1703633259","2"
"130142839","MariaFF","Made this for dinner at work. I doubled the sauce recipe and prepared 1.5X the chicken.  I also added more sun dried tomatoes.  Pounded chicken made it 'fork cutting tender' and the sauce adhered to its surface area splendidly. Will be adding this to my monthly meal schedule at home.  Coworkers loved this- firehouse approved!","1704049753","2"
"130329586","Zandra","Already married with children but was looking for a recipe to use up the heavy cream I had left over from making Alison Roman's tiramisu at Christmas.  This was excellent and so easy to prepare. Every plate went back into the kitchen clean!! I used chicken tenders and served over bow tie pasta.","1704759109","2"
"130937871","courtney","Love this recipe. After first following the recipe fully, the next couple times we’ve added mushrooms to sautée right before the garlic and some frozen peas when the broth goes in. Makes it a full meal.","1707107047","2"
"136323160","Charlotte","This may be contentious, but I am not sure what all the fuss is about. It tasted like a really basic creamy tomato sauce, a fake American version of ‘Italian’. Absolutely nothing special whatsoever.","1726794392","2"
