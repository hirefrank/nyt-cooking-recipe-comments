The best, easiest, vegan krispie treats are -so much more easily- made with the following ratio:  one-third cup each of maple syrup and tahini; 3 cups of the cereal. A fantastic, exotic taste without fuss or nasty cleanup.","1705288278","94"
"130588727","Sharon","@Veronica: So you made significant changes to the recipe, then dissed it? Play fair.","1705768493","50"
"130438670","Todd",""". . . stir the blend like you’re frying rice."" As someone who rarely fries rice, I have to ask . . . what does this mean?","1705177237","44"
"130538699","mtmartini","My partner makes black sesame rice crispy squares with black sesame paste, which takes them to a new level. Finding the paste and paying for it is another thing.   To this recipe, I would add one to two heaping tablespoons of the paste at the same time you add the marshmallows, depending on your taste.","1705595220","28"
"130440626","mellie1234","I just made them with Sprouts vegan vanilla marshmallows, and it worked perfectly. They take a little longer to melt, but otherwise taste delicious.","1705184058","27"
"130439282","R. Ellis","An old stylist trick: line the pan with foil first. Even better use non-stick foil (made our lives and work easier.)","1705179284","20"
"130597093","JLW","Maybe you should try following the recipe.","1705800412","17"
"130439432","Lynne","These are delicious. Not too sweet! Made exactly as recipe says.","1705179825","16"
"130496125","JRG","Yes, I'm replying to my own review with an update: I thought about these all day today. Couldn't wait to come home and eat one. These are SO good.","1705456700","16"
"130468683","Veronica","They are good but nothing to rave about. I might look for higher quality toasted sesame oil if I make these again. I did NOT add the oil to the mix, just greased the glass pan and toasted seeds. My standard receipe uses vanilla extract but not this one, so i used 16 oz of large marshmellows instead of the 12 oz this mix calls for. Also, the plastic bag the cereal comes in makes a great nonstick surface to press down the warm mix into a pan. Just cut it into a large square","1705358237","15"
"130465857","Joyce","Made as written, easy and delicious. I doubled the batch knowing they would be a winner. The seaseme seeds cut the sweetness and make this a nice adult treat.","1705338925","11"
"130451872","Julia","Absolutely delicious, especially served with milk. I used white sesame seeds because that's all that my local grocery store had; I dry toasted them first.","1705253399","10"
"130499250","Nic","marshmallows from Trader Joe's are vegan.","1705469941","9"
"133478353","Cole","If you up the recipe by 1/3, you can use a whole 16oz bag of marshmallows (the bags I found only came in 10 or 16oz). This also uses close to the whole box of Rice Krispies and a whole stick of butter.   This makes a great amount for a group as you can make it in a rectangular pan (like a 13x9) instead of the square one. I used a glass one I had with a lid, and it was perfect.","1716788060","9"
"130435343","jodyG","Any idea how well these work using vegan marshmallows?","1705167713","7"
"130470445","Keith Alverson","Mine look browner. I think because my sesame oil is good japanese toasted sesame oil, and very dark.  Otherwise I made by the recipe. They are delicious.  Like black sesame ice cream, but crunchy and sticky.","1705371272","6"
"130491936","Belle","These are divine :) made them vegan with Dandies marshmallows and Earth Balance butter (also used brown rice crispies from WF) and can't stop snacking on them","1705443946","4"
"130524924","Natasha","Life changing. Delicious and easy. Best Rice Krispie treat. 10/10. A must-try!","1705539750","3"
"130636871","jennyl","Good, though tastes salty. I used 1 tsp maldon sea salt flakes. Next time I’d just use 1/2 tsp.","1705986520","2"
"130777076","Esther","Ok these are our absolute new favorite dessert! At first I think our brain was a little confused as to what we were eating.  After the first bite settled in... WOW!  I've made them three times and I can't keep them in stock in the pantry.  LOVE LOVE LOVE them!","1706494731","2"
