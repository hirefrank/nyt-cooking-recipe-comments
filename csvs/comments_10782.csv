"15881568","Sydne Newberry","This has been my go-to brownie recipe for 30 years, even after going to baking school! I agree that using the best cocoa possible makes a difference. These days, I use Callebaut. In the 80s, an acquaintence in Germany to whom I brought some of the brownies, and who considered herself a great cook, asked for the recipe but was never able to get it to work. She kept asking me what she was doing wrong and I was never able to solve her problem. Eventually, she moved to the US and stole my husband!","1509373111","3887"
"16524083","Stephen Exel","Bake it like Kate: Food & Wine published this recipe in a dessert book published in the late '80s. They left the method in Miss Hepburn's original rendition. Step 1 calls for the eggs and vanilla to be added to the melted cocoa/butter mixture, and then you ""beat it all like mad."" This you must do with perfect posture and cheeks sucked in, of course.","1509377555","1347"
"16911987","Keith","No one else has mentioned how important it is to let the chocolate batter cool sufficiently before adding the egg mixture.  If the batter is too hot you will cook the eggs and the brownies will not rise or set up correctly when baked.","1509378122","927"
"21248381","Booger McSmoot","I substituted applesauce for the butter; you lose the crispness that butter provides, but I didn't have butter.  Also didn't have vanilla. I substituted 1/2 cup (8 tablespoons) bourbon.  Add 1 teaspoon to the batter, reserving 7 tablespoons and 2 teaspoons in a glass of your choosing. Add the best ice you can find.  Sip while brownies bake. Find inner peace","1508858525","843"
"104725688","M","This is the go-to brownie recipe for so many people, including me, that I wasn’t planning on commenting. However, it seems like all the other people who love this recipe are swimming in a sea of Valrhona chocolate like Scrooge McDuck diving through piles of gold coins. Just wanted all the other bakers getting cocoa powder at Trader Joe’s and Walmart to know that everyone loves these brownies, even if made with regular ingredients. *Everyone* loves fat and sugar. Sincerely, a broke grad student","1579570868","837"
"15045021","Edith F","Use good cocoa, not Dutch. I use Penzey. Mound the cocoa measurement a little and underfill the sugar a bit. Toast the nuts, preferably pecans. Throw in a couple more pinches of salt, and 1/8 tsp of espresso powder. Easy and amazing and very popular.","1509369002","806"
"22505726","Carla","The sugar should be added to the melted butter before the eggs. Not with the flour mixture. The sugar reduces the temperature of the butter so the eggs don't scramble. I've been making this recipe since my Mom worked in the food department at McCall's magazine.","1506868468","436"
"16605862","Emily Weinstein","Hello all, we have retested and adjusted the baking time on these brownies to reflect your notes. The original baking time was 40 minutes; you'll see the recipe now suggests 30 to 35 minutes. These are best when they are gooey and fudgy, so as the recipe says, take care not to overbake!","1509376684","422"
"16518336","Susan R","I, too, have made these brownies for years and think that they are the perfect mix of nuts and gooey chocolate.  I have always used 2 ounces of unsweetened chocolate.  I also cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup.  I make sure to use the full cup of walnuts, and even those who don't like nuts in brownies, love these.  Have to watch when the brownies are in the oven, particularly when using a square glass Pyrex pan, because they cook more quickly.  As soon as you smell them, they are nearly done!","1509375903","314"
"16724334","Louise","Best brownies ever!  I followed the recipe exactly except for a small adjustment--I melted the butter and cocoa in a large glass bowl in the microwave, thus saving myself the task of having to wash a saucepan.  Lined the pan with greased parchment paper for easy removal.  Baked for 29 minutes.","1509377099","275"
"16525531","Matt","Add some dark rum. Dark rum makes everything better.","1509376139","268"
"17488115","LEL","The melting point of butter is about 95°F--well below the temperature required to ""cook"" eggs.  Do not rush the melt by setting the stove to frying temperatures.  Cut the butter into small pieces to melt faster at low temperature.  It is actually faster than waiting for hot over-heated fat to cool!","1508869812","263"
"16517876","TMS","I have been making these for years. I use one teaspoon of espresso powder in it.  Everyone's favorite.","1509376224","221"
"15490500","anne","Good point about salt.  I use about an 1/8 teaspoon Maldon salt.  Also I find it necessary to line well buttered pan with foil and then lavishly butter foil.  I let foil overhang sides of pan and lift out when cool for easy cutting.","1509372116","165"
"16523214","SandraS","Have tried many brownie recipes, but this one, which I have used for years, is the best.  I started out using 2 oz of the unsweetened chocolate, but recently began using 3 oz unsweetened choc and found this to be an even more delicious brownie.  No need to increase the sugar if using 3 oz.","1509375907","165"
"23541023","Jane","Doubled  recipe in a 9 X 13"" glass dish, greased, not with butter (which burns) but I used a light coating of Pam.The batter is stiff, needs to be spread out evenly,  it will seem to be too little or low in the pan however they rise, yielding 24,  2 "" square,  1"" thick<br/>i wanted a  both chewy and fudgy  texture with a bit of rise to it, so I added 1/4 tsp of baking powder, to the doubled recipe.   They came out just as i described with a shiny cracked top.","1506880538","137"

"15872888","Linda Newman","I always admired Katharine Hepburn.  Tried her brownie recipe.  It was a big success.  I put the nuts on the top only as they roast while the brownies are baking.  Will we be treated to other recipes of KH?","1509372660","71"

"16531525","Susie","I did over bake this, a fault of my crazy oven.  This is an adult brownie, not overly sweet, and has a nice rich dark chocolate taste.  I used Giradelli's cocoa powder.","1509376076","68"
"15850212","A Mayer","just like Mark Bittman's in Cooking Everything, exchanging his 2 squares of unsweetened choc with 1/2 c cocoa.  excellent brownies","1509372585","66"
"16518507","LynnG","Baked with walnuts on top, instead of stirred into batter, then, after baked and removed from the oven, frosted with a thin layer, about 1/4 inch, of ganache and you have heaven.","1509375719","66"
"31101407","Darren","Great recipe.  My family loves brownies that are more on the fudge v cake side of the spectrum and these fit the bill beautifully.    I make a few tweaks.  1.  If you're using an 8 X 8, double the recipe.  Otherwise they are pretty thin.  2.  This is particularly true because I skip the nuts.  3.  When I melt the butter and cocoa, I add 1/4 cup chocolate chips.  4.  After several tries, I've found that you can cut the sugar in half.  Way more chocolate as opposed to sugar flavor.","1552867281","64"
"16771011","The Tortoise","I can see this recipe belonging in the archives if just for the cachet of association with a beloved actress.  But there are much better brownies out there - for instance, any other brownie I've tried from the Times.","1509376696","57"
"17878995","Laura M","Good question!  To quote from the King Arthur Flour site: ""[the old$ recipe calls for “2 squares unsweetened chocolate, melted.” Used to be a square of unsweetened chocolate was 1 ounce; these days, a square is 1/2 ounce.

"30282939","Ellen Tabor","Line the baking pan with foil, using enough foil to create an overhang at opposite ends; since this calls for an 8"" square pan, if you take a 16"" piece of foil, you will have 4""overhanging both ends.  Grease it with butter.  Once the brownies are done and cool (and they will firm up a little as they cool) simply lift out the foil and use a pizza cutter or long sharp chef's knife to cut the brownies into squares.","1548211201","38"
"28667528","Sabine","I think this recipe is great, except for the sugar content. Instinctively, I used 3/4 cup sugar but next time I will use even less to make the other ingredients stand out more. It’s a common problem with American dessert recipes: Too. Much. Sugar.","1537383375","37"
"16632765","simply the best","i use extra dark cocoa powder and dark brown sugar instead of white sugar. gives them a dramatic appearance and a deeper flavor. they are terrific either way. this is my go-to recipe for brownies. If i have a little extra time i make them as brownie bites in parchment mini cupcake papers.","1509376676","36"
"17888543","Laura M","A question for the NYTimes food editors:  why did you change an essential element in Katharine Hepburn's recipe?  As others have pointed out, she didn't use cocoa powder, but chocolate squares.  (See: <a href=""http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/katharine-hepburns-brownies-106559"" title=""http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/katharine-hepburns-brownies-106559"" target=""_blank"">http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/katharine-hepburns-brownies...</a> )   Since I had only coca powder on hand, I was happy to use it, but frankly the result was lease pleasing than my usual method (underbaking the ""back-of-the-Baker's-chocolate-box"" recipe).","1508872259","36"
"24712248","tianlei","Melted the butter in the 8x8 pan I was using inside the oven, and then transferred it to a glass mixing bowl after it had melted. This solved two problems - the butter melts properly and slowly in the oven and cools faster when transferred to a room temperature bowl, and secondly, it coats your baking pan for non stick cooking. ","1509788597","36"
"17752832","Elle Kaye","I melted butter and cocoa in metal mixing bowl while preheating oven. Took Edith F.'s advice to ""mound"" cocoa and lessen sugar. Omitted nuts, added 1/4 tsp. salt, 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper, 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon, 1 tsp. finely powdered espresso. This doesn't taste spicy, they just ""wake up"" the chocolate flavor. When baking nearly done, I sprinkled a thin layer of mini-chips on top, let soften, and spread them over entire cake.","1508872480","34"
"16521285","Laura","If they're hard as a rock, it's because you baked them too long.","1509375440","33"
"16614271","Nancy","These were excellent!<br/>I found that doubling the recipe and baking for 35 minutes or so in a 9"" square pan worked very well.<br/>I tried cutting back a bit on the butter and sugar but everyone preferred the full sugar and butter, original (doubled) recipe.","1509377256","33"
"25559116","Elvis","Save clean-up time by doing all the mixing in the saucepan. Save prep time by not bothering to grease the pan, there's enough butter in these brownies to come clean. Increase your yield by using a rubber spatula to get every drop of batter into the pan. And make sure to wait until the brownies are cool before removing them from the pan or else you just end up with goo that you need to reform into actual brownies, which is, however, possible.","1515930026","33"
"17888548","Laura M","P.S. You might mention in the recipe how FEW brownies this recipe makes.  If I'm going to the trouble of baking brownies, I'd appreciate producing enough to give some away.  If I'd been aware, I would have doubled it.","1508872647","32"
"18653354","Edith F","Tweaks:  little changes in preparation. <br/><br/>To prepare pan, butter it and ""flour"" it using cocoa rather than flour. <br/><br/>After melting butter after very low heat, stir in sugar and stir over the low heat until  partly melted. Add cocoa  and stir in till melted; remove from heat to cool. Proceed as usual.","1508876143","31"
"30549098","OnThePlate","In response to Chef Z, that may be true of some recipes not intended for home cooks, but if you grew up baking at home in the US, the opposite is true. Assume salted butter unless unsalted is specified. Salted butter is the kind typically found in American households and recipes have been written with this assumption for decades. For this recipe and the context and era in which it was written, I would assume salted butter.","1549756589","30"
"24160980","LeslieMac","Outrageously good! I've made this 3 times. I'm not sure high-quality cocoa makes a difference -- I used plain old Hersey's every time -- but European butter makes a HUGE difference. Kerrygold butter baked for 35 minutes and they were perfect (at 30 mins, they will be gooey and messy to cut). American butter makes them significantly drier.","1508764035","28"
"16595928","Allie","Yes, Bill -- try lining your pan with baking paper instead of greasing it. Then you can use the sides of the baking paper to lift the baked brownies right out of the pan.","1509376945","21"
"18024614","Brian","This was not a great recipe -- I followed the instructions to letter, even letting the butter and cocoa to ""cool for a few minutes.""<br/>I was expecting a thick, rich, fudgey browning but they were think and over-cooked.  Doing some research online, I found that the same version of the recipe added the sugar to the melted butter and cocoa after cooling but before adding the eggs and the vanilla.  Makes much more sense given that sugar is considered a liquid ingredient in baking.","1508871190","21"
"23463040","quinn neuhofer","Because of the low flour content resulting in a fudgey batter, this brownie is more dense and therefore, thinner. most brownie recipes do not require a levening agent, which is the biggest distincation between brownies and cakes.  the baking powder was not inadvertently left out of this recipe, adding baking powder would undesirably and drastically change the texture of the brownie!","1506878557","21"

"15870388","sheila","Leaving out most of the flour was so smart of Katharine. I used Ghirardelli cocoa, and these turned out dark, intense and addictive. Eager eaters suddenly discovered ordinary brownies were too cakey for them. Very easy to make and we'll do so often.","1509373583","19"
"16360998","eleanor1","This is the worst brownie recipe I have ever tried.  Hard as a rock.  Thin.  Too sweet.  Never liked her and I don't like her brownies any better.  Compete waste of time and ingredients.","1509376041","17"

"17487989","Berat","It should've been made clear that the butter cocoa mixture should've cooled down completely. I only waited a few minutes and my eggs just cooked. Admittedly, it was my fault to not think it through but I was in a bit of a hurry and was following the recipe to the letter. I was devastated.","1508869889","16"
"30018223","Conan","This was easy and delicious. I baked it in a cast-iron skillet, which added a nice carmelized crust. I also threw in some melted baker's chocolate and coffee grounds for good measure. ","1546755529","15"

"15871267","littlemissdelight","so easy and very good flavor; i only had a 9x9 pan so I doubled the recipe (except the walnuts) and baked for approximately 40 mins at 325 in my vulcan. the end result was gooey and delicious. this will be my brownie recipe from now on.","1509373521","13"

"19542027","ellen","A Trick to removing them -- Line pan with foil. Turn pan over & press foil around sides and bottom.  Remove foil from outside and reinsert it to pan, pressing into corners.  Use a potholder or paper towel to press into corners (so as to not tear foil).  Spray or butter as usual.<br/><br/>When cooled and set, just lift the foil.  Et voila.  I freeze mine, but that's a cosmetic thing.  It keeps the brownies moister longer after defrosting b/c there's no evaporation during cooling.","1508882404","11"

"30609333","Chuck","I don't get all the fuss about salted versus unsalted butter.  Salted butter actually has very little salt in it.  Salt enhances flavor, and I'm guessing that it was added to preserve butter pre-frigeration.  In fact, many unsalted butters have ""natural flavorings"" added!  Really? If you're worried about it, omit the ""pinch"" of salt called for in the recipe if using salted butter.","1550119055","11"

I prefer a dark not overly sweet brownie. Also found that my local creamery butter has a lot of fat in it and made the brownies too moist--standard unsalted butter from the store works better.

Then added sugar with burner in low...removed from burner and whisked hard.  Then added already beaten eggs very very slowly while still stir in also added vanilla.  Then flour and salt..

"30355637","Erin","My new go-to brownie recipe. Other reviewers described these as gooey, which is not what I'm looking for in a brownie. I used 1/2 tsp salt and bread flour, because I'm a sweet-salty, ""chewy"" brownie girl. Loved them. Dark, rich, and fudgy. Despite the 1c sugar, they were perfectly sweet. Very easy to make with ingredients that are readily available in the house. Definitely let them cool completely, so they don't fall apart, and line the pan with aluminum foil for easy removal.

"112677889","Barbara","I adored Hepburn and copied this recipe from an article interviewing her back in the late 50s, and from her mouth to your ears, here is what she gave as her recipe: she used dark bitter baking chocolate, not cocoa. She mixed the entire batter in the actual pan in which she melted the chocolate. She didn't fool with an extra bowl. Maybe using cocoa is better, but I've never tried it because the original recipe is so very good. I just think it should be mentioned as a ""version"" of her recipe.","1619981364","9"

"17253439","Meg","Very close to fudge. A tasty mess (bars were not happening for us) when fresh out of the oven, but then hardened to the consistency of concrete, and now having to hatchet it out of the pan. Hepburn was a great actress, though.","1508868248","8"
"17538823","Sam","The easiest and best brownie recipe. To make it EVEN EASIER make the whole thing in a double boiler and mix the whole thing in one bowl rather than fouling up a saucepan. I've always used unsweetened chocolate squares but the cocoa worked just fine as well.","1508869544","8"

"29757726","SuzyQ666","Good idea! I generally line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper, and spray the sides of the pan, and the parchment with cooking spray like Pam. If you remove them onto a large enough cutting surface, and invert the pan, your brownies will come out easily, with parchment paper now on top. C-A-R-E-F-U-L-L-Y remove the parchment paper and cut the brownies into squares, using a sharp knife, dipping the knife in a glass or other container of ice water, after each slice.

"101680098","Ashley G","I was reading all of the helpful tips from other bakers as my pan of brownies was in the oven, looking for advice on what the texture of the brownie should be like when it is done. Kudos and thanks to the baker who made the comment that once you smell the brownies, take them out. I had 4 more minutes on the timer (30 min) when I smelled a delicious chocolate scent wafting through the house. I checked on the brownies and they were done - clean test in middle and on sides!","1564239232","8"

"18651432","Steve Roth","My mother made her own version of this brownie with one alteration.  She used the same amount of walnuts as called for but used black walnuts instead of white or your standard walnut.   The flavor of black walnut is complex versus the one dimensional white  walnut.  And to be honest some self acclaimed foodies think they are too rich. Phooey.<br/>When you find them and try one batch, go back to the store and buy 4 packs for your freezer.","1508876593","7"
"21130134","Sarah","I just made these today and let me just say, OMG!! These brownies are just ridiculous! This will be my new go to recipe from now on. I threw in some bittersweet chocolate chips and toasted walnuts. I would like to try 2oz of bittersweet chocolate in place of 1/4 cup cocoa powder (when doubling recipe) next time.","1508858895","7"
"27730478","John","Love the flavor, but wish I’d read the notes first.  These brownies are, indeed, fudge-like and sticky, so lining the pan is a must.  Otherwise, they are difficult to neatly remove, which I found to be quite a challenge.  ","1530680963","7"
"30610247","Erika","LOVED this recipe! I made it for my husband for Valentine's day and he was also a huge fan. I wanted to add chocolate chips, but accidentally put them in when the batter was too warm and they melted into the batter, making it even richer. Might do that on purpose next time ;) Impossible for these to end up dry if you follow the directions. Fudgey, moist, chocolatey goodness! My new go-to recipe for brownies.","1550135051","7"
"100432993","Janet H NYC","I doubled the recipe, adding a rounded 1/8 t of cayenne. I baked it in a 9X13 inch pan for 25 minutes and they turned out perfectly.

Makes it flexible, something you can easily whip up with stuff you have on hand. ❤️","1569163300","2"

"104088264","Emliza","You cooked them too long. Trust the time on the recipe. They should be gooey. Let them cool completely before cutting and cut them carefully.","1576061339","2"
"104441158","jil","Great success! I baked this in a buttered 8"" glass pie dish. I sprinkled the pecans on top after pouring in the batter, which created a nice crisp top.  It was hard to get the brownies out of the dish so next time I will use parchment paper on the bottom.","1578165314","2"
"104807086","Dana","Perfect for GF instances-  had to use almond flour instead and was wonderful.  Chose pecans, and then added 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper and 1/4-1/2 tsp cinnamon (I forget).  I do this with many other chocolate recipes so wanted to try it out.  Had used unsalted butter as I wasn’t sure what it called for, so after the pinch of salt in the batter I still sprinkled the top lightly with maldon.  The crunchy salty bits were amazing so would totally have used a little more on top!","1579914958","2"
"104830843","matt","The recipe picture shows a nice neat stack of perfect square brownies.  Mine were so gooey that I had to shovel them out of the pan in clumpy bits.  They were good but I wish I had squares that I could hold in my hand and bite, rather then scooping up bits and chunks.","1580073954","2"
"105382763","Deborah","I am a big fan of Katherine Hepburn and brownies are probably my favorite sweet, so this recipe caught my eye.  I have made it twice now, exactly according to directions and I cannot overstate how delicious these are.  Perfection.  I have used walnuts and pecans and both are great.  As most everyone has said in their comments, don't let the gooey part lead you to think they need to be cooked longer.  You won't be disappointed.","1582412525","2"

"105735606","Steven Sutton","I would recommend using melted unsweetened chocolate instead of cocoa powder. Also, you should trying adding white chocolate chips. I recommend Guittard.","1583881676","2"
"105951826","linds","I was worried about overcooking. They looked good at 25 minutes so I took them out. Turned out *too* gooey so timing is important. Flavor, texture, and walnuts were great!","1584753852","2"
"105960501","Melissa G","This is the only brownie recipe I’ve ever used, for like 50 years. The only thing I do differently is melt the butter and choc in the baking pan right on the stove then add all the other stuff and bake. Perfect every time.","1584818279","2"
"105969953","Larry BH","My go to easy brownie recipe since I read Ladies Home J interview of Ms Hepburn in the 80s where she used 2 sq of bakers chocolate .  Variations, like 1/2 c shredded unsweetened coconut are easy.  You can also substitute 3 TBS of green butter for an adult dessert and freeze the brownies in 2x2 squares.  Just label carefully.","1584884675","2"
"105996230","phalgal","These are amazing. Also, I think, very customizable. Next time (probably tomorrow, at the rate I'm eating them!) I'm going to use pretzel pieces instead of nuts. Also going to try some spice combos, such as cayenne, or ginger and cardamom.","1584994947","2"
"106958935","Kim","Yes, ""beat like mad"" was the wording from my grandmother's ""sewing group"" cookbook from 1984 for ""Kate Hepburn's Brownies."" Also two squares of unsweetened chocolate were called for instead of cocoa powder and after ""mixing all that up, dump the whole thing into the pan quickly.""","1589039066","2"
"110999296","Tyler","Honestly, I think all brownies are good (it’s hard to mess up gooey chocolate). This one was no exception but I don’t think it was great. It’s a dense brownie (good!) but didn’t develop a crispy top & the finished product tasted almost like I was just eating the batter.   If I make again I would probably add espresso grinds and 1/8 teaspoon of baking soda","1610203731","2"
"114717652","Ruth","Ok this is how you make this recipe: Melt 1 stick butter, add cocoa, let cool. Add vanilla, 1/4 tsp espresso powder, 1/4 tsp cardamom (if you like that flavor profile). Add 3/4 cup sugar to mixture. This cools it further before you beat in eggs. In separate bowl, add 1/4 cup flour, 1/2 cup pecans, 1/4-1/2 cup chocolate chips, pinch of salt. Mix until all covered in flour. Add to pan with butter mixture, mix just until incorporated, put in 8x8 baking pan (essential!), bake for 20 mins. Let cool.","1632709485","2"
"115772281","soloist66","Woah -- I need to make these brownies on a regular basis.  I mostly followed the recipe but substituted 3/4 brown sugar for white and in addition to the cocoa powder, I also added 2 ounces of Ghiardelli bittersweet chips along with the chopped pecans.  Also followed the tip to add 1 tsp of espresso powder.  Finally, I baked in an 8 x 8 pan and sliced into 16 pieces.  For me, this was perfect size-- after all, brownies are treat not a meal replacement.  Thanks for all of the tips!","1638647075","2"
"116089052","Jo","I made these for Christmas, and they were divine!! I am personally not a huge fan of wet gooey brownies, so I upped the flour to 1/3 cup, and baked 35 minutes.  Because I was baking for someone who can’t have gluten, I used King Arthur’s 1 to 1 gluten free baking flour mix. I had pecans on hand, so I used those instead of walnuts.  The result were the BEST brownies I have ever made or had. You would never know they were gluten free. I’m making again with regular flour for friends this weekend!","1640627009","2"

"118034344","Carolina","Amazing.  While I’m sure the better the cocoa, well you know.  I used simple Hershey’s and will never make or try another recipe again.  Thank you Ms Hepburn and NYT cooking.  Followed the recipe to the letter and it did not disappoint.","1651017355","2"
"125067298","Pam","Re: cutting cleanly  I’m sure I might  be blasted for this but this works for ME: to help with slicing, I let these cool in the pan for a bit then put the pan in the fridge till they firm up. They cut nice and evenly 🙌","1684029024","2"
"132123725","Emily","I doubled the recipe and baked it for 30 minutes in a 9x13 pan. Threw a few chocolate chips on top before baking to make it look extra pretty. I otherwise followed the recipe line-by-line and they came out delicious.  I recommend cooling the brownies for AGES before cutting. 2 hours at least. At one hour post-bake they were overly gooey. Two hours post-bake they were fudgier and the consistency was noticeably better.","1711498169","2"
