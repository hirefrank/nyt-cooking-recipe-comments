"17236801","Karen","Where you use towels to hold the dough, I use parchment paper...then I grab the paper, lower it into the 450 degree pot put on the lid, and bake it.  No sticking.  No burning.","1508867714","4032"
"17315779","Abby","My results were equally perplexing. I used 3 c of flour. Added 1 c butter and 2 c semi sweet morsels. Two eggs and some vanilla. Instead of forming a loaf, I spooned tablespoon sized balls on a baking sheet. Baked for 10 mins at 350. Came out tasting like chocolate chip cookies!!! Not sure what I did wrong. Maybe a little more tweaking will help.<br/><br/>I'm kidding, but you didn't follow a single thing from the original recipe. Your comment has nothing to do with Bittman's recipe.","1508867573","2975"
"14899846","Molly Gallucci","I've made this for years. I double or triple the batch and after rising 2 hours I put it, tightly covered, in the fridge. The next day I take out a large handful/grapefruit sized amount of dough, shape it and let it rise on the counter on a lightly floured silpat covered with a kitchen towel for 1-2 hours depending on how much time I have. Follow the preheat directions and use the silpat to transfer the dough to the pot. You'll have dough for days and it will taste more complex as days pass.","1509369402","1548"
"14805244","mjan","In a follow-up article, Bittman's article added the recommended weights for the ingredients.<br/>430 grams flour<br/>1 gram yeast<br/>8 grams salt<br/>345 grams water<br/><br/>Bittman also noted he settled on just under a tablespoon of salt -- call it 16 or 17 grams.  I use 16 grams.","1509368167","1409"
"17244008","RD","I've made this for years and, at the outset, found that last rise outside the bowl was a disaster--dough stuck to whatever it was placed on and sprawled all over the counter if left unchecked. I started to do all the rises, including the last one of two to three hours, inside the same steel bowl, and have never looked back. Easier and we've found has the same results","1508867359","1010"
"17364444","Joyce","Maybe this will help you: I line a bowl with parchment for the second rise. At that point the dough sticks somewhat. But when it's time to bake, I pick it up by the 4 corners of the parchment and just plop the whole thing into my preheated Creuset Dutch oven, put on the lid, and bake as directed. The parchment peels off easily after baking. The crust is amazingly crisp and the crumb is like in the picture. Just had some with supper tonight.","1508868047","991"

"26980262","Big J","You can't always get what you want.  But if you try sometimes, you find you get what you don't knead.","1525471884","560"
"16462223","Nannette","Not 1/4 teaspoon yeast ; but 1/4 ounce equals 2 and 1/2 teaspoons of yeast. Made it as recipe states once ! Obviously flat! Excellent bread","1509375537","524"
"30136956","Chris","Note to all cooks who use a LeCruset with the Phenolic knob - it is only oven safe to 375 (it will explode and melt in your oven if you put it in the oven at 450).  Best to replace with the stainless steel knob, which LeCruset says can withstand any oven temp (available at many retailers and inexpensive).","1547414207","501"
"17235380","Steve Martin","I have been making this for years.  Every time I do, folks declare it the best bread they've ever had.  Tip: for an airier crust, increase the water to 1-3/4 cup.  I for this tip at th Scottsdale Farmers' Market from the bread chef at The Phoenician resort.","1508868471","441"
"14813174","Patricia C","I have been making this for years too and do a lot of variations.  Diane: it helped me get over my fear of baking.  Also check out Bittman's variations.  These days I usually use 1 cup of whole wheat, 2 cups of unbleached white bread flour, handfuls of pumpkin, sunflower, poppy and sesame seed, and one heaping half tsp of instant yeast.<br/>Susan: The towel is definitely the hardest part of the recipe!  So I let it rise in a greased bowl, covered.","1509368606","376"
"18512559","Jim R","For those looking to improve the flavor, try slowing the rise!<br/>Cooler temperatures encourage bacterial fermentation, converting starches to sugars that result in a more complex flavor.<br/>After shaping the loaf in step 3, try refrigerating the dough overnight, then allow 6-8 hours at room temperature for the final rise, instead of 2.<br/>It increases the time from 24 hours to as much as 48 (or more), but you'll never know unless you try...<br/>I also prefer more salt.","1508875044","329"
"17243342","KAE","I have made this general recipe weekly for 5 years...I find it extremely forgiving.  I double it, cover, leave it overnight.  I stir it away from the sides in the a.m. pop it onto a floured board, cut in 2. Fold each one into itself, make a nice balls.  Cover with towel 35 min, while containers heat up.  Place each one into the hot dish, place cover on and bake.  Gorgeous crusty round bread when done!  Slightly more or less of any ingredient doesn't make or break--it is an amazing recipe.","1508867541","323"
"17594006","CCM","I've made Mr Lahey's bread so many times I've lost count. I've stopped buying bread in stores. I converted the volumetric measures for flour and water to grams and use this recipe: 430g bread flour, 345g water, .25tsp dry active yeast, 1.75 tsp course salt. I use an electronic scale to weigh the flour and water. Works every time.","1508870364","306"
"15841174","Jane","I use a pizza pan and a stainless bowl that I heat in the oven... and it works really well, since I don't have a heavy pot with a lid.","1509373208","252"
"17485538","Abby","I love this recipe, but when I made it my dough was always wet/sticky. Jim's dough (at 1:53) is stiffer. His dough at 2:22 is firmer. He tossed into oven, I poured. <br/><br/>I just tried the recipe according to the video using 1.5C of water, 430g of flour. Oven at 500. Loaf is taller, crust is more caramelized. What a difference. <br/><br/>My only mod was to skip the towel. I use a very lightly oiled bowl for final rise. Works great. Dough stands taller and slides nicely into Dutch oven.","1508869976","222"
"17595060","Rita","The best bread. I use Cooks Illustrated's modifications. I use part beer for the liquid. Gives it a malty taste. 10 oz AP flour; 5 oz white whole wheat. Honey as a sweetener. 1 tb vinegar. I form the loaf on oiled parchment and use a pie plate for that rise. The parch,net becomes a sling to move the dough from the plate to the heated pot. I've also used a long covered clay pot to bake the bread to get a long loaf. The parchment helps with that too.","1508869612","220"
"19723257","Theresa SF Bay Area","Mark Bittman wrote a follow-up article called No Kneading, but Some Fine-Tuning on 12/6/06. He specified gram weights. 430g of flour, 345g of water, 1g yeast and 8g salt.  Hope this helps.","1508883735","217"
"17408855","Charlie","The advantage of using weight in baking is that flour's density changes depending on how tightly it's packed and some other factors so a cup of flour doesn't always contain the same amount of flour. Measuring flour by weight ensures that you're getting the exact amount the recipe calls for every time.<br/><br/>Using weight also has a convenience factor. You can just keep putting ingredients in the same bowl and setting the scale back to zero which saves a bunch of clean up","1508867379","208"
"16388800","Natalie","I really like this recipe and have shared it with many people.  I use 1.5 cups whole wheat and 1.5 cups bread flour - works great. For a slightly cripsier crust, I add 1 tbsp of olive oil.","1509375397","180"
"16066612","paulpegg","I have been making this since Jim Lahey published his book in 2009. A variation I like the best substitutes rye flour for 25% of the flour and adds 150 grams of red miso to the water. Just add water or flour if the mix is too stiff or too sticky. <br/><br/>I like the idea of oiling a stainless bowl for the rise and then pouring the dough into the dutch oven. Score the top of the dough, add a handful of ice cubes around the edge, put the lid on to add some steam in the pot to boost the initial rise.","1509374759","174"
"16330875","ko","Just wonderful.<br/>It's pretty forgiving too.<br/>Per the video, I used very high heat on the first attempt but the bottom charred.<br/>The video is helpful but just follow the recipe as written.<br/>I've added olives to this base before the second rise with excellent results.<br/>Also, I always double the recipe, making one for now and one for later. A few days in the fridge before the second rise makes a loftier, more complex loaf. I usually prefer the second, ""aged"" loaf.","1509376262","174"
"30656373","Annie","That is a harsh statement, ""lazy and knowing nothing"".  As for sourdough, that's fine if you like sourdough.  I do not in fact.  I prefer a fluffy interior to my bread with a crunchy crust that I have never been able to get through sourdough.  I am going on 83 and have cooked and baked all the years I remember and I believe there is nothing wrong with a shortcut sometimes.  Especially when you have other things going to feed a family or group of 11 men gathered to make wine in my cellar.","1550334126","167"
"18996570","Teresa","Someone noted that their Dutch oven lid knob would not take the 450 oven temperature. That problem can be solved by putting aluminum foil over knob to protect it.","1508878299","163"
"17042873","coo","I've made this recipe many times since the original publication And it always turns out great. I'm not very fussy with the ""turn it out on a towel"" part (even just dumped it straight from the bowl) and never had problems. One thing has helped a lot: my cast iron Dutch oven is old. I found that if I line the lid with heavy duty aluminum foil it seals much tighter and I get fabulous rise.","1509378168","161"
"15870161","LW","Drop it in oiled stainless steel bowl for the rise then dump easily into baking vessel. Can add fennel seeds for more complex taste.","1509372739","156"
"18529438","Tom Tigue","After the rises,I put the dough into a room temp covered baker , put it into a room temp oven, turn oven on - set to 450F - let bake for 55 minutes - covered - then uncover for 10-15 mins.<br/>No nasty putting dough into a flaming hot pot with an equally hot cover..... check the bread with a pen type thermo - 195-200F is fine. ( No wasting energy pre-heating a large oven either.)","1508876362","143"
"17949433","Marlo Finner","I seeded, deribbed, & sliced three large jalapenos and mixed them in with the flour, salt, yeast and water.  Right before putting the dough under the towel for two hours to proof, I folded in 1.5 cups of shredded aged white cheddar.  Baked at 450 for 35 minutes, removed lid and baked for another 12 minutes.  Let stand on rack for 15 minutes. Tremendous.","1508871195","128"
"16698405","Ben Helvensteijn","This recipe seems pretty much foolproof. Made the dough last night (23:30), then left it overnight in the oven with its light on (kept it 21.5°C\71°F). At 08:00 scraped it carefully onto an oiled & floured springform and baked it right after per temp\time directions.  And, yes, that leaves out the risky hot-pan manipulation (sigh of relief): With a lightweight springform there isn't really a drawback in not having it preheated. So, having it sit longer isn't needed to taste great.","1509376850","122"
"29474580","Scudder","Whoever said that one should place the bread on a tea towel for the second rise should be shot.  Parchment paper is the intelligent choice.  This dough is way too sticky and would require way too much flour not to stick on a towel.","1542748625","121"
"106054225","NotaBaker","I was 100% convinced this would not work. Could not work. Not with me at the measuring bowl.   I used a whole packet of yeast. Oops. I probably screwed up flour measurements. Does kosher salt measure the same, or do I need more? I have no cotton towels, just determination and a carb addiction. There is no [tea]spoon.  It's still turned out more perfectly than anything I've ever attempted to bake. I may never buy store-made bread again (and not just because of the apocalypse).","1585176481","114"
"106220041","Gail","Instant"" yeast can be added to dry ingredients. If you use ""active dry"" yeast (which is different) you have to activate it first, Take about a 1/4 cup of the water from the recipe, heat it to about 110 degrees, and *twice* the amt of yeast (1/2 tsp) and a tsp of sugar. Wait for a few minutes--it if foams and bubbles, it's active and you can then add it along with the water to the flour.","1585845931","111"
"16790318","Gregg","I agree with Jake.  Weighing ingredients is far more accurate than measuring by volume.  I use 440 Gms of flour, 1 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp yeast, and 1-2 tsp of gluten, just because.  For small amounts, measuring spoons are fine.  Then 345 Gms of water.  I make this bread ALL THE TIME.   Makes a great gift. Cooks Illustrated has a modified recipe for those who want more flavor.  It has a bit of beer and a drop of vinegar in it and is quite good.","1509377281","109"
"16790368","Gregg","I do my second rise in a bowl with a parchment sling under the dough.  When I pull out the hot dutch oven to put my dough in, I lift it up and place it into the D.O. by the sling.  I don't worry about getting burned now, and my dough doesn't sink from the violent toss into the pan.  If you use the sling method, be quick and fluid in your motions.  If you go slowly the dough can fall off of the parchment sling.  Hope this helps.","1509376765","94"
"23800782","Peter Best","One and five-eighths cups? Can anybody claim to be able to measure that approximately, let alone accurately? Enough of this mad stuff. Give us grams, millilitres or at worst, pounds and ounces. I know that science is on the nose in the US but a bit of accuracy in the non-political world of the kitchen should be acceptable. Please don't refuse to acknowledge the virtues of other peoples' ways of doing things.","1506884536","92"
"18609092","Tom Tigue","I just put it in a room temp Dutch oven, into a room temp oven, turn oven to 450F - bake 50 mins covered , then about 10 mins uncovered till it tests out at internal 195 - 200 degrees...no nasty hot pots to deal with.","1508875471","84"
"15596905","Nancy Miles","In the video he used 1 1/2 cups of water, not 1 5/8. Mine too was very sticky and I had to add more flour. Will use 1 1/2 next time!","1509372302","82"
"30657443","David Griffiths","Cooks Illustrated has a version of this that is much better (I've made both). They add vinegar and lager (beer) to give it more flavour, and they call it ""mostly no knead"" as the do knead for 30 seconds.  This version is a little anemic in flavour, but the CI version is one of my faves.","1550342826","67"
"17615872","Margaux Laskey, Staff Editor","Sorry for the confusion. In general, on our recipes, follow the written recipe and think of the video as a demo.","1508870535","60"
"16404524","Mickey2942","Turn on your crockpot, lowest setting, and when it is slightly warm, unplug it, and place the dough in there, in a separate bowl. <br/><br/>This works in Montana.","1509376146","59"
"17141217","Niels Damrauer","Ive noticed that there is a lot of variation in the density of the all-purpose flours we have bought. With the less dense ones my dough becomes far too wet with the 1 and 5/8 cups of water. I have found that  when my cups of flour weigh about 146g/cup the process is far easier than when they weigh about 130 g/cup. From now on I will be weighing out 440g of flour as a surrogate for 3 cups.","1508868847","59"
"30547199","Francoise","I recently added a tea spoon of avocado oil, into which I previously added Rosemary and Oregano leaves a few hours b4. Heaven! I sprinkled the loaf with Parmesan cheese, right off the oven. Neighbours came knocking at my door!  With balsamic vinegar, this one is an appetizer. ","1549737789","59"
"18512521","Jim R","It seemed like some commenters were put off by the idea of using rapid-rise or quick yeast.<br/>Most of the time, a product labeled ""quick"" never comes into my kitchen: I have no desire to pay extra for a product that promises convenience but yields an inferior result.<br/>Not so with a rapid-rise yeast! It simply has a much lower percentage of dead yeast cells.","1508875931","56"
"30650767","Adrienne","has anyone tried doing this with gf flour?","1550280553","53"
"30674835","Liz","I've been making this bread for years, using Lahey's recipe. I weigh the flour (430 grams), use 1 1/2 c. water, 1 1/2 tsp fine sea salt, and 1/4 tsp yeast.  The loaf turns out perfectly every time. I bake it in my Le Creuset dutch oven. I have perfected moving the dough from the cornmeal dusted towel (less sticking that way) to the hot pot by gathering up the towel around the dough & doing a quick 180 flip of my wrists which flips the dough into the pot. My bread bakes in a total of 45 minutes.","1550468605","52"
"14978665","Maxine","This is my go to bread recipe.  I usually add kalamata olives, and maybe chopped fresh rosemary or herbes de provences with the olives.  I wish though it was 50% larger.  I make it usually with 2 cups bread flour and 1 all purpose.  I would like a larger loaf, but think I would screw up the proportion of yeast if I messs with it.  Help me Mark.","1509369545","49"
"17324625","Ratty","I followed the recipe and came out exactly as described and looks like the picture! Taste delicious too. <br/><br/>If it didn't work for you, try following the direction exactly -- don't tweak the recipe with different measurements until you master the basics! The recipe works!","1508867422","49"
"18538351","Theresa SF Bay Area","Here is a follow-up article from Mark Bittman in which he discusses the size of the pot.

"29916796","Corinne","Help! love this recipe, but the bottom of my loaf is often very thick and hard--difficult to cut and not easy to eat. -how to fix?","1545972235","37"
"30658761","beth","I've been baking this for years and it's a favorite.  It works better with a hotter oven: 500 degrees.  The problem with the higher temp is that the enamel on many dutch ovens will melt at 500 as mine did.  I bought a cast iron without enamel and the bread is perfection with an even harder crust due to the higher temperature.","1550352965","36"
"30550643","Mich","The problem with recipes like this is th use of cups, which is just too imprecise for baking.   Any decent bread baking book will recommend you measure by weight.  400g of flour 320g of water 8g salt 3g of yeast.  works every time.  ","1549773313","35"
"16595891","Charles","I've used this standard recipe for five years.  And I've learned to play with it.  I've added fresh rosemary during the first 18 hr rise and then Moroccan olives during the last 90 min to two hour rise.  I've added baked butternut squash pureed with the juice that flows out... mix it into the flour -- add water until you have a proper dough.<br/><br/>Baking bread is my favourite thing to do.","1509376755","33"
"22761031","PJ","I made this with 2C gluten-free flour and 1C oat flour, and accidentally left it for 24 hours, not 12-18. It rose well, behaved a lot like gluten-full bread dough, and had a nice texture when kneading. I baked it in a heavy cast iron pan- I realized I didn't have anything to cover it, so I baked it with the top open. OMG, the flavor and texture are good! There is a wonderful sour note, texture is good and it holds together. What a treat after not making bread for years.","1506870551","33"
"30659698","Richard Schinella","Sorry Chris, but arrogance isn't close to Godliness, so I'm in complete agreement with Annie on this subject (and I've been baking for 55 years). I've baked many excellent French & Italian breads that are extremely demanding (time-wise) and produce excellent bread, but this recipe produces excellent quality bread with very little work.","1550360265","33"
"18043168","Jacqueline","No Carol, it is ONLY 1/4 teaspoon in the original recipe, this one.  You may be looking for the speedy version, which does use a full packet of yeat, but gives poorer results IMOHO.  Look for ""speedy no-knead bread"" for that one.  I am making my nth loaf of this bread this morning, using only 1/4th teaspoon, and it is rising beautifully.","1508871271","31"
"19668507","Carolina","I have NEVER used a 6-8 quart dutch oven for this.  The largest I've used is a 5-quart, but my favorite one to use for this recipe is my 3.5 quart oval Le Creuset.  The larger ones are too big and the loaf just spreads out flat.","1508884221","31"
"21502886","Bettina","I used whey drained from my Instant Pot homemade yogurt as the liquid - seriously over the top bread! I've also let the dough rise in the Instant Pot on yogurt setting for 12 to 18 hours.  The longer the rise the better it tastes.  Can't  believe I can make bread like this at home!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe :-)","1508866229","31"
"22018938","Kerry Montgomery","Cooks Illustrated found, as did I, that replacing part of the water--about half--- with a good mild beer (not an IPA or dark beer) really adds to the yeasty flavor of this bread.  Try it.  It works.","1506864434","31"
"100321490","Kate Wilson","In Lahey's book, My Bread, he asks for 1 1/3 cups water, instead of 1 5/8, as Bittman writes. I tried both measurements and the 1 1/3 makes a perfect loaf every time (1 5/8 cups water makes the dough excessively sticky and it doesn't plump up to a perfect dome).   Our family adores this recipe and makes it weekly.","1556966835","29"
"17261396","Es","This is my first time making this. I have made the 6-hour version frequently. This is phenomenal: the quicker one is wonderful, this one is even more wonderful. I used 1 1/2 cup regular unbleached flour and 1 1/2 cup bread flour, a generous 1/4 tsp yeast, and next time I think I'll only use 1 1/2 cups water. The dough was very sticky and I didn't think it would work but wow! it sure did. A 4-qt. Staub pot (I used cornmeal) cooked it perfectly, the crust was the essence of a crust.","1508867576","28"
"29373379","Cornelia Taylor","I am puzzled by the oven temperature difference.  In the video, they mention 500 or 515 degrees but in the written recipe it 450.  So, which one is correct?  Help!","1542001045","28"
"23803054","David B","One more idea to throw in - I use a long stainless steel fish pan to get an elongated loaf!","1506884003","27"

"28318846","Laura","I spent years attempting to make fabulous bread with mixed results. I nurtured a sourdough, bought special equipment and lots of books, and took classes. I finally decided it was impossible to do in a humble home oven. Now several years after abandoning my quest, I made this bread using the trick mentioned in one of the notes of throwing an ice cube into the pan after the dough and discovered that the bread I've been questing after isn't just possible, it's impossibly easy.","1534861189","26"
"17003818","Hattie","I made this recipe - and got rave reviews - with the following substitutions:<br/>1) whole wheat flour (I used 3 c, but in the future would do less. It was almost too dense;<br/>2) substituted active dry yeast for instant by priming one packet (slightly more than the recipe suggests) with a couple of tablespoons of warm water;<br/>3) olive oil on top for an extra crunch and more flavor;<br/>4) two teaspoons salt; and<br/>5) used a 3.5 quart Le Creuset (due to the density of the ww flour this size worked)","1509378237","24"
"30557532","Ann Goodman","I used parchment paper today and viola!  Success!  No muss, no fuss.  The bread came out just has beautiful, both on the top and the bottom.  In fact, it looks even better because when I made the dough ball I placed the seam side down onto the parchment paper covered bowl, so after it raised and was placed in the hot dutch oven, the beautiful dome was maintained. ","1549833083","24"
"30656774","Christine","Can I make this bread in an oval Le Creuset or must it be round? I guess it would have to be an oval shaped loaf and baking time might vary. Thought?","1550336407","24"
"17563512","RB","I've made this many times and it works beautifully! My only issue with the recipe is requiring a very specific 5/8's of a cup of water. Most of us don't have a measuring cup that can do this - so just measure 1/2 cup and add 2 tablespoons (or half of a 1/4 cup). So many variations to play with! This will become one of your favourites as well.","1508870861","23"

Push the exposed foil against the sides of the pot. That will seal in the steam better. The other problem, if you have a very chewy thin crust, is that your oven might be too cool.

Watched Jim Lahey fold the dough and then form a ball, but this was near impossible. Had to add a 1/2 cup more flour and still very sticky. Have experience with wet doughs (ciabatta, baguette, etc.) but this was different. I ended up flopping it on the floured towel and baked in a cast iron combo cooker. Crumb tasty but a bit dense, and crust good. Also, video says 500 vs. 450 in recipe?","1509369069","9"

Next time, make sure your yeast is still alive by proofing your yeast: Just put some yeast and a little sugar in a glass of water and wait about 20 minutes. The water should start to foam -- that'll prove your yeast is alive and well. It's a bummer to have this happen; I hope you have better luck in the future.","1509374059","9"
"18466181","Brandon O","This makes amazing pizza dough!  If you want it ""finished"" faster, just add more yeast and leave in a warm place, I put mine next to our wood stove in winter and it rises within the hour, less flavor, but works great!  If the dough is too wet to work with, just add more flour until it doesn't stick, then press out your pizza crust.

These proportions (75% hydration) gives a less sticky, more manageable dough than the original recipe (80%) - maybe start off at 75% if you're new to this method.  Thanks to all who suggested ditching the towel and using the same bowl for the second rise; so much easier!  I use a 3.5qt oval cast iron pot which works perfectly and gives a high loaf.","1520165316","7"

This produces a great crust and an open crumb very much like a traditional pane pugliese. In addition, I find that a smaller dutch oven contains the spread better and results in more oven spring. I use a LaCreuset No. 22 round pot which I think is only rated at 3.5 or 4 qts. I score the top with 4 scissor cuts in a square pattern.","1521472793","7"

When I realized the mistake, I looked up the conversion, and you should technically use 1.25x the amount of active dry yeast if substituting for instant yeast. So in this case, it would be 5/16 of a tsp of active dry yeast instead of 1/4 tsp instant yeast. I just use a heaping 1/4 tsp. Works fine for me. I've made 3 loaves so far.","1586467351","5"

How is the dough after 2hr proof? If it didn't expand, the yeast is probably dead or it's underproofed. Try moving it to a warmer room or proof with the oven light on. If it's more than 2x it's overproofed and will collapse when baked. Be gentle handling the dough or you'll knock the CO2 out and it won't rise.","1587670192","4"

Let it sit 15min so yeast wakes up smoothly b4 adding water. Also, add 1 tea spoon/organic brown sugar to lukewarm water *careful, water cannot be 2 hot or it kills the yeast*. Yeast needs food (sugar) to rev up her motor & rise. Then, mix warm water & flour. Once dough bowl is been covered with plastic/cloth, a hot water bowl placed under it will provide energy 2 rise ;)","1549736916","3"

Some notes: it works best with high-quality flour, and you will definitely see variation with flour types. King Arthur all-purpose flour seems to yield the best loaves for us (soft inside, bubbly, crust isn’t rock hard). Other types of flour will yield wildly different results even if all other factors hold constant. Allowing the dough to rise for something like 24 hours works best!","1556829321","3"

"104375777","Will","You don't really need to make any changes; your bread will just rise more slowly at a lower temperature. The upside is that a longer, slower rise will also develop more flavor— this is why bakers often allow their dough to rest in the refrigerator overnight before baking.  You may want to make your first loaf when you have time to keep track of its progress in your environment so you know what to expect the next time, and the next, and the next.","1577794802","3"

The long ferment allows plenty of opportunity for the 1/4 tsp of yeast to do its work. If you're having problems it isn't from the yeast. Artisan doughs are typically wet. That can alarm bakers used to drier doughs. Wetter dough gives you a more open crumb. Also measuring by volume is less accurate than measuring by weight.

"104030518","EricJM","The herbs can be mixed into the dough, and the olive oil can be brushed on side that will be top before adding to pan. I would eliminate the bran or cornmeal on top if doing his. For the Gruyere, it seems it would be best added when you take dough out of container and lay out right before folding. Put in Gruyere, then fold. I like to add sesame seeds, or poppy or flaky salt, etc. on occasion. I find done best if I eliminate bran then oil top with oil of choice or melted butter, then add topping.","1575757457","2"
"104030591","EricJM","It is okay to flour sticky dough to fold and shape.  I would also recommend parchment instead of towels.  It's easier to handle and can even be lifted and placed directly in pan with parchment.  Parchment will not burn and helps it just turn out of the pot onto cooling rack.  I use it because I don't want to use bran or cornmeal.","1575757805","2"
"104364625","catzi","Variations: For seeded bread thickly scatter seeds of choice–i.e. fennel, poppyseed and sesame–on parchment rather than a towel for the second rise. Parchment helps the seeds adhere and I find it easier to flip. For a cheese-y loaf scatter in about a cup of shredded cheddar divided in at least three fold-overs. Rise on parchment and lower it into the hot baker. Brush with olive oil and more shreds. Works best with dry aged cheddar. Fabulous toasted!","1577726627","2"
"104368983","Penny","I, too, have made this recipe for several years.  It's always delicious.  I also make a variation using half whole wheat and half all purpose flours, and then add coarsely chopped walnuts and rosemary.  The rosemary, walnut version is also delicious and almost always eaten with butter as soon as it comes out of the oven. I did find adding some extra cornmeal to the hot pot before adding the dough helps the bread release more easily.","1577742972","2"
"104372497","catzi","Did you heat the pan for a full 30 minutes before putting the dough in? The high heat should repel the dough. If your Le Creuset is an older version with an exposed iron bottom it might help to put a reflective pan under the pot on a lower shelf to prevent burning. I use an aluminum pie pan for this when I use my older baker.","1577759109","2"

I didn't backwards plan the resting time-so the dough went in the oven ~11pm. Next time, I'll plan better to eat fresh while the crust is crunchy & perfect.

We are fortunate to have the space to have hung on to a Romertopf clay cooker that has been rarely used for anything but baking bread (actually 2 of them-- found the second one at Goodwill). This bread dough is fairly loose-- so it needs a pot rather than a pizza stone in order to raise the sides. W/most pots you'll get a nice enough crust and some lift, but in a CLAY pot you'll get BRICK OVEN results!  Delish and gorgeous!","1589550929","2"
"107062553","Donia","It's a slow-rise bread, so you don't need to start with warm water to get the yeast going.  Just keeping the dough in a decent ambient temperature long enough will allow the yeast to multiply (and it starts off slowly).","1589551252","2"
"107062870","Donia","Anything w/sides if you want a loaf to use for sandwiches.  A pizza stone is awesome if you don't mind the dough spreading like a fat foccacia (reduce the baking time).  Even a very clean red clay flower pot would make for a fantastic crust and lots of lift (cover the hole with a bit of foil).  VERY IMPORTANT:  Be sure to pre-heat your clay pot (or pizza stone) so the sticky dough doesn't get into the pores-- the heat seals the crust right off & makes it easy to get the loaf out.","1589551816","2"

"118549501","Mary Ann Shubert","This is a wonderful recipe.  I've been making it pretty much every week for over a year and have dusted it with a very finely ground cornmeal.  Yesterday I was out of that cornmeal so had to improvise.  Instead I used a very coarse cornmeal intended for polenta.  It was terrific!  It added some crunch to the crust and looked very attractive to boot.  That's what I'm using from now on.","1653766168","2"
"118802108","BB","I prepared the dough the night before a camping trip, and baked it in a Dutch oven using hot coals from our campfire to rave reviews. If the weather ever gets warmer, it should be an easy recipe to prepare entirely at camp, but it wasn't warm enough outside for the dough to rise this weekend.","1655167286","2"

"121875900","Ben","A less fussy approach is to proof the dough in your Dutch oven, covered, and bake as is. If you leave the Dutch oven in your oven while it preheats, it will slightly reduce the proof time required.  Also, if you mix in two Tbsp of gluten to the flour mix, your crust will turn out more crunchy like an Artisan bread. Einkorn flour adds a lot of flavor compared to typical bread flour.   Also, most store bought yeasts stop fermenting far more quickly than wild yeast, so a long proof is not useful.","1670397931","2"
"121875946","Ben","Someone asked why their dough was so liquid-y and their bread turned out rubbery. I have found this recipe can be too wet, especially in a humid climate. Try reducing the liquid until you can form the dough into a ball and not have your hands completely coated and sticky with dough. Plenty of steam is trapped in the Dutch oven as the bread bakes. This ratio of water to flour makes more sense in a dry, high altitude kitchen in Denver but may not work well in Miami or Houston.","1670398607","2"
"121958655","Sarah","Gently folding in before the second rise, I think. Consider gently coating the wet ingredients (sun-dried tomatoes, cheese, olives) in flour before adding them in so they won't sink down in the bread.","1670856452","2"
"122078802","Peter C","Every week for the last 2 years I have made 3 loaves of bread based on this recipe.  1) You do not need a dutch oven. Put a lump on a sheet or use a bread pan.  2) Even if you use exactly the same ratios every week, the dough will vary. 3) Dough  range from  runny (bread good for toast, long rises, longer bakes,frustrating)  to  stiff enough to handle with you hands (30min bake) . 4) Rise1=3+ hrs. Rise2=2hrs. No final knock down/rise. 5). Bake=465deg,","1671386667","2"
"122967312","Trilby","This was a new recipe for me.  I made this bread twice this week, weighing the ingredients, with great success.  The first time, on Sunday, the ""dough"" was more like a thick batter; I had to add almost an extra cup of flour before it became a ""shaggy"", cohesive ball. Today, I only had to use the 430 grams of flour, without adding any extra. The difference?  On Sunday, it rained all day long.  Today was clear.  I'm assuming that the higher humidity on Sunday required more flour in the dough.","1675391410","2"
"123008751","S. Parker","For lean breads like this (no fat, no dairy) you want temp to be 200-210; 190 is not overbaked, if anything it's under.","1675612084","2"
"128474993","Michelle Jones","The hardest part about making this bread is waiting for it to cool before cutting a slice. This recipe yields extraordinary results with minimal effort. Start a new tradition of making the dough on a Saturday and baking on a Sunday to ground yourself for the week ahead and to fill the house with the intoxicating smell of a fresh loaf or two.","1697396642","2"
"128595948","Linda","Cold oven method...Do 2nd rise seam side down in Dutch oven lined with oiled parchment paper. Slash dough, cover pot & place on middle rack of cold oven. Turn oven on to 425F and time 30 mins. Remove lid and time 20-30 mins more, until done. (internal temp 210F). Works just as well as the hot oven method, and much easier.","1697814096","2"

"130181257","CBelle","This turned out soft and chewy in the inside and just the right amount of crusty crunch on the outside.  I was one of the few people who didn't make this during COVID.  But somehow, now's the time.  I let it rise just a little longer than 14 hours.   I am already making my second load.   Also, the video was helpful plus it made me smile at the beginning of a somber day.  Thank you!!","1704249267","2"
"131243204","Ann Marie","For those of you who are caught up in weighing water.  One mL of pure water weighs 1 gram because the density of water is 1 gm/mL.  Most glass (Pyrex) measuring cups have measurements in cups on one side and and in millimeters (mL) on the other.  Do the math.","1708204972","2"
"131319150","Richard","I forgot to start this recipe the evening before a dinner party but hastened the first rise by placing the bowl of dough in the oven set to “proof” (100F). In a couple of hours the dough had doubled and was covered with bubbles. I then followed the normal recipe process and it came out beautifully.","1708541501","2"
