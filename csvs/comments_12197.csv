"17001635","Ben Cripps","I have made this numerous times.  Everyone loves it.  <br/><br/>I found that the salt/sugar mixture at the final stage, tended to fall off of the roast.  Basically I would have small patches of sugar with the rest ending up on the bottom of the roasting pan.<br/><br/>I experimented a bit and now I add a small amount of cider vinegar to the salt/sugar combo.  It forms a nice paste that stays in place and forms a nice lacquer.   I also used water and various liquors but landed on the vinegar as the best.","1509378252","1917"
"17410525","RK","The one cup of white sugar and one cup of kosher salt that you cure the meat with for 6 hours, do you leave it on the meat or wipe it off before baking at 300 degrees?","1508870148","1480"
"16806439","Randall","I prepared thanksgiving for the Girlfriends family. All twenty-three of them. Yes there was turkey and the green bean casserole, I couldn't help but throw this in the mix along with crab Rangoon. They like me now.","1509378332","604"
"18582317","carolfitz","re the dry rub.  For what it's worth, there's quick video of Chang & Martha Stewart prepping this and he says don't remove the rub prior to cooking.  <a href=""http://www.marthastewart.com/334288/bo-ssam"" title=""http://www.marthastewart.com/334288/bo-ssam"" target=""_blank"">http://www.marthastewart.com/334288/bo-ssam</a>","1508875958","534"
"18896234","Eleni","I desperately wanted to make this for Father's day but live in a small house and the idea of running the oven for 6+hours in the summer heat was unappealing. Cooked the pork in my slow cooker for 8 hours and then followed instructions, coating the meat brown sugar and placed it in the oven for 20 minutes on 500. Turned out perfect, soft on the inside, crispy outside and my house was a comfortable temp for all!","1508878159","532"
"17419048","marcolius","I've made this several times, and it's always been a hit.  A couple suggestions:<br/>-It makes A LOT.  Plan on feeding at least six, but up to 10 or 12.<br/>-Secondly, for some reason my crowds really heap on the ginger-scallion sauce, and I've taken to (yes, really) tripling the recipe.","1508869585","525"
"22067412","jenfalv","Here is an interesting piece of info that might clarify the salt debate.  The Jan/Feb 2017 issue of Cook's Illustrated reports that there are significant differences in sodium chloride levels in the three main salts used by cooks. This could account for the differing results. I know the time I didn't use Diamond Crystal salt, my bo ssam was nearly inedible. They say:<br/>1 tsp. table salt = 1.5 tsp.Morton Kosher salt = 2 tsp. Diamond Crystal salt","1506864835","505"
"22630981","JonnyD","I've made this twice, once as written (but halved) and another in a slow cooker. The slow cooker was better, so sharing if it's helpful: 3.5 pound boneless shoulder. Halved salt in initial rub (i.e. 1/6c salt to 1/3c sugar for 3.5 pds), 12 hrs. Browned sides in a pan over medium heat, ~1-2m each side. Slow cooker on low for 7 hrs. Finished as written. Suggestion to add apple cider vinegar to brown sugar worked great. Previously, it all ran off and burned, setting off smoke alarms.","1506869518","359"
"16209208","Sam Sifton","Skin up!","1509374158","299"
"17412102","Lyn","This is my third time making this dish, and all three times it's been received rapturously (really, who can argue with candied crackling and fork tender meat?). <br/><br/>The recipe as it is, is amazing. But my favourite hack so far is using radicchio instead of the bibb lettuce. The bitterness of the radicchio is great with the salty-porkiness and zingy condiments.","1508870436","257"
"17330060","Mathias","It's the same cut of meat. Pork shoulder is also called Pork Butt or Boston Butt. Living in Boston for a number of years, I always just took this interchangeability for granted, but a quick search reveals that the term 'butt' originates from the wooden casks, called butts, that were used to encase the cheaper off-cuts of meat for storage or shipment around the time of the American Revolution, and not the anatomy of the animal. So there you go!","1508868870","251"
"17309933","LP","Save a step.  Whole Foods carries the Ssam sauce pre-made.  Woot!","1508868462","243"
"17300508","Ellis","Use parchment paper on the bottom of the roasting pan.","1508867684","242"
"17308650","KM","I've made this several times now, but instead of the ssam sauce I mince fresh hot chilies (Thai or habaneros) & raw garlic and let them sit in a mixture of rice wine vinegar, salt, & sugar for a couple hours.  (I also like to make Japanese-style cucumber salad -- tastes great in the wrap!) Also, I rinse the salt/sugar off the pork and cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil for the slow roast. That way, I don't have to baste, and I don't get a hard-to-clean mess. :)","1508867767","199"
"17611948","Teresa","Best. Pork. Ever. We call it pork crack! ;) We are a family of four and thus had a lot of leftovers. One of our favorite ways to use up the leftovers is to mix some ramen noodles with the pork and the scallion ginger sauce and top with a poached egg and the ssam sauce. Absolutely delicious! We have also done similar with leftover rice that we stir fry. Can't go wrong with this recipe the day you make it or with leftovers!","1508870679","191"
"17334026","Sam Sifton","This recipe works so well because the pork butt's so fatty. Beef, I think, would dry out; likewise, venison and moose. I believe my brother tried it with moose and got a decent result, but he may simply have been very hungry.","1508867399","164"
"17656423","David Bertan","After eyeing this recipe since it was first posted, I finally broke down and did it.  I used half a Boston Butt, about 4 lbs, so I used 1/2 cup of salt and sugar to brine it.  I also added a tablespoon of 5 spice powder.  It cooked exactly as written, with one small exception: I added some water to the roasting pan because I wasn't getting enough drippings at first.  The pork was perfect, falling apart as I lifted it out of the pan.  Would definitely cook this again!","1508870077","145"
"17954557","Marcy Smothers","I had my guests at the driveway. The amazing aromas that wafted into the neighborhood did not disappoint at the table. Next time I will save my manicure and use a heavy duty disposable pan with a quarter sheet rack inside (the deep carmelization on the pork was also on my roasting pan and quite the chore to clean). For sublime lettuce, try my grandmother's trick: After washing and air-drying on paper towels, place in a cotton pillowcase and tuck in the fridge a few hours.","1508872094","141"
"15084883","Gerry","Made this exactly as written for a house party crowd ( 10 adults) up at the cabin. One of the best evenings remembered of good food, great conversation, and as the cook, I got all the compliments! This was so easy - we were out all day hiking while the pork cooked its way to perfection. Sauces were whipped up over pre-dinner glass of wine.<br/>To the writer who skips the last step so as not to ""smoke up the kitchen"" - oh live a little! And to the other writer who skips the sauces - why oh why?","1509369073","129"
"17508323","Eric","Do you rinse the cure off before cooking? Just scrape it off?","1508869947","108"
"14829883","LoriB","Outstanding! Easy and guests loved it. The second time, I did the slow cooking a day ahead, then warmed the meat up at 300 for about an hour and a half before the final high-temp roast and it turned out great. I'd love to experiment with the salt/sugar cure--maybe add some 5-spice powder? Also used doubled-up disposable pans the second time, because clean-up in a heavy roasting pan was a challenge.","1509368209","91"
"16962483","Sam Sifton","Too late now, but you don't need to cover!","1509378918","84"
"23972153","George Aye","After cooking this about six times, my notes:<br/><br/>Pork shoulder from Costco about 14lbs (2 x shoulders about 7lbs each). Due to long cook time, I cook both shoulders, serving 1st, cut up   freeze 2nd. <br/><br/>300°F for about 12 hours min for the meat to fall apart as expected and internal temp to hit 200°F. <br/><br/>I used two disposable pans, one as a pan the other as a lid, saved me the constant basting. Take off the lid for last 2hrs for color. Finish w/ brown sugar at 500°F as instructed. ","1508764033","80"
"25857105","Sam Sifton","Lots have asked whether you can make this dish in a slow cooker or pressure cooker and of course the answer is yes -- you're applying heat and humidity, under pressure or not, for long enough to collapse the meat. But that's a braise not a roast and you're not going to get good ""crust"" out of the skin. You're going to end up with a floppy glove of it that's not going to candy-up the way it will if you follow the original recipe. So I'd do it as written.","1517942587","77"
"15779341","Tim H","I respect your restraint, but I leave on as much fat as possible. Sweet, salty, buttery inside, crispy outside pork fat? Doesn't get much better than that. Though I don't mind bits of meat with my fat.","1509373670","70"
"16287303","Maeve","MAKE THIS PORK. So delectable and impressive, you will make it many, many, many times. Great for special occasions, birthdays, etc.<br/><br/>I've skipped the final application of caramel crust plenty of times, and I've made the Ssam sauce with chili garlic sauce in a pinch- very similar flavor accounting to the sherry vinegar.<br/><br/>If you're single: This also is an amazing bento-style lunch for work/school etc that lasts for a week or two. I usually stick in some cherry tomatoes and a hard boiled egg.","1509375990","67"
"16023825","Dave","Made this for the first time yesterday - it was fantastic, and easy!  I dialed back on the salt and granulated  sugar by about 1/3 and the results were great.  Watch like a hawk during the final 10-15 min brown sugar char - the skin can go from delicious bark to scorched very quickly.  It was delicious even with a little scorching.","1509374926","63"
"15472253","courtney","Made this several times as written and it is worth the time. However this weekend I had a rack of pork spare ribs and wasn't sure what to do with it so I made bo ssam ribs and they were awesome! Just rubbed them with the same mixture, let sit over night and let them cook at 300 till they were falling apart. So tasty I had to resist the urge to eat them all while standing at the stove.","1509372198","60"
"24186335","CR","Fantastic meal for little effort!  After making it a few times, I changed the brown sugar process at the end.  I push the meat down to expose more of the meat, add some of the juices to the brown sugar mix to make a paste, and then brush the brown sugar mix like icing all over the top.  It was terrific!  The brown sugar worked its way through the meat without overpowering the top, and there was no charred brown sugar.","1508764074","57"
"15849677","Ben French","This has become my favorite recipe for serving a crowd. After making it a few times, I've found I like the way it turns out when I cook it a little slower. Try 275 degrees and it will just take a couple extra hours.","1509372659","54"
"28183987","JR","Made this at least 10 times and it's always a hit. The last two times I had guests who didn't eat pork so I substituted a baby goat leg and it was spectacular. Followed the suggestion of other reviewers and wiped off the salt/sugar mix before cooking it and took it out after about 3.5 hrs. Guests that announce they're vegan AFTER you tell them you're serving Bo Ssam: substitute fried cauliflower for the meat and don't invite them back.","1533907856","53"
"24376329","Patricia","I found a jalapeño garlic sauce recipe that is wonderful with this:   Jalapeño Garlic Sauce 2 jalapeños 2 cloves of garlic dash of vinegar dash of soy sauce salt and pepper grape seed oil  Roughly chop jalapeños and garlic cloves and place in a blender. Season with salt and pepper. Slowly drizzle in grape seed oil until it takes on a creamy sauce-like consistency.","1507564598","51"
"18494139","Florence","A slow cooker works great for the first step. The butt will be incredibly moist and tender.  Cook for eight to ten hours on 'slow' depending on size.  A couple of suggestions. First, secure the pork butt with kitchen twine before placing in the slow cooker.  Doing so makes it easier to transfer to a roasting pan for step two.  Second, a slow cooker won't work for step two.  Transfer the slow-cooked butt to a roasting pan and finish in oven per directions above.","1508874910","46"
"17668805","Sam Sifton","On top of the skin. This is one of those cases where you can ask the butcher not to trim the meat, so you can cook with it on. It makes for a delicious part of the final presentation.","1508871908","38"
"25554682","Frances/David Tanis","I experimented a bit and now I add a small amount of cider vinegar to the salt/sugar combo. It forms a nice paste that stays in place and forms a nice lacquer. I also used water and various liquors but landed on the vinegar as the best.","1515862517","37"
"26985343","val","Made last night. 10 stars. Have another David Chang recipe which I clipped from a magazine.  Calls for 5lb boneless shoulder/butt.  Cure is 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 C kosher salt.  Do not rub off.  He says to cover pan with foil/baste every hr. I took off foil for about last 45 min or so to brown a bit as covered it looks anemic.  For the final sugar rub,  you use degreased pan drippings and combine with sugar.  No smoke at 500 deg finish.  Added Persian cucumber salad to accompaniments So Delish.","1525538116","36"
"29582452","Joe N","An important note from his book: he says to use enough of the salt/sugar mixture to cover the pork and discard the excess.  I generally only use a teaspoon of salt per pound and adjust the sugar accordingly, because the amount called for is a waste.","1543631411","36"
"16081256","Eric","We made this with a 5 1/2 pound butt. It turned out exactly as described (like a deflated football) with a hard crust and very soft interior. It took almost 6 hours to cook, so a larger butt might take longer? (I cooked it to 200 degrees internal, as for BBQ.)<br/><br/>It didn't get too smoky, but the pan was coated with char and ash. As someone noted, disposable foil pans would be a great idea. <br/><br/>This is pretty much a perfect recipe. We did have leftovers, which will go on tacos tonight.","1509374412","35"
"14590511","KensCooking","MAKE THIS.<br/><br/>Made per recipe for four. It was absolutely amazing and delicious, albeit a bit of work. <br/><br/>Finding ssamjang was a bit of a challenge in our Asian Market, but well worth it. It's a taste unlike any other I've tried. Do a web search for ssamjang and see what the container looks like, that may help you find it.","1509368556","33"
"15535846","CSS","Be sure to brush off the extra salt/sugar rub before the long cooking. I did an almost 11lb roast - it took 7.5 hours to cook and honestly could have used a few more in order to be pull-able in the center. Outstanding recipe with the two sauces, we all loved it.","1509372169","31"
"28395429","Wigs","Echoing the note to use Diamond Kosher Salt or consider seriously cutting down the salt if you’re using Morton’s Kosher Salt. First one turned out like a salt lick!","1535348207","30"
"16879224","Nancy","1. I cooked a smaller roast (8 lbs.) and 1 cup each of sugar and salt turned out to be too much. You need enough to cover the surface, but 1/2 cup each for a small roast would probably be enough.<br/><br/>2. You should definitely scrape off the rub before cooking.","1509378122","26"
"17487395","John L.","FYI, I have seen kochujang chili paste spelled Gochujang.  A little research with Google indicated that they are both acceptable romanized versions of the same Korean word.","1508869826","24"
"16347140","Tom","Yes to brushing off the rub.  I didn't do this and I wish I had.","1509375445","23"
"17093071","Oliver","Success! I also made a paste with the brown sugar and salt by adding a little cider vinegar. It worked well. I also ended up broiling it for a little bit at the very end to get the perfect texture. I cooked it at about 225 for almost 10 hours using a meat thermometer to monitor the internal temperature. The most labor intensive part of this dish by far was the cleaning and dicing of all the scallions. Well worth it though. The meat was everything one could want. Sweet, tender and juicy!","1508867822","23"
"29496718","Greg","Changes to make after ~8 times cooking this:  1. Line the baking sheet/roasting pan with aluminum foil for easier clean up. 2. Cook at 275 for five hours 3. Use the low broiler to caramelize the sugar at the end - it simply takes too long in the 500 degree oven.   ","1542928685","22"
"29960957","Noah","I've made this six times. Two ideas: 1. salt needs more time to season interior  meat of a large roast, so rub with  .5 tsp kosher salt per pound of meat 48 hours before cooking, and cut the salt in the sugar/salt step in the recipe. 2. The dish takes beautifully to a little smoke, so you can either start or do the hot finish using indirect heat on a kettle grill, with some apple wood. Crisping up with the brown sugar in a hot kettle grill also saves mess and burt sugar smell in kitchen.","1546370972","22"
"17483165","PWJ","I tend to wipe a little but not too vigilant and don't rinse or wash it off. If you leave it all on the au jus gets fairly salty.","1508869811","21"
"18598398","Ben","For the Ssam sauce: If you have a hand blender, use it to mix the sauce. It'll prevent the oil and vinegar from separating. A food processor will work too.","1508875893","21"
"30454233","Lisa","This was as knock your socks off good as its reviews suggest. My guests loved it. Here are a couple of things to know (thank you other reviewers): • You are not meant to use all of the initial rub, just as much as is needed to cover the meat, which turns out to be about half. I didn't brush any of it off before cooking. The top of the roast is good salty-sweet and the interior is not at all too salty. So half turns out to be perfect. ","1549211022","21"
"17258377","Julia","I have done this in a slow cooker and it works fine. I usually cover it, and while you lose any crispiness it becomes very tender and pulls apart beautifully. I use any fat or skin leftover to cook beans at a later date...","1508868264","20"
"17180691","Kathleen Russell","Wow wow wow, cooked this exactly as the recipe said except I used a 4lb roast, and cooked it at 275 for 6 hrs. I did wipe the rub off a bit. Will make again soon for company.","1508868009","18"
"17260739","Kathleen Russell","Yes, it is a miracle. Nothing should taste this good. This was my second Bo Ssam. Made according to recipe except used half the salt and sugar. Left guests raving.","1508868025","16"
"17171133","LoriB","I've only used boneless--works great!","1508868935","15"
"22395002","camiller","reduce salt/ sugar for dry cure, always add 5 spice.  Drain the juices cook without wiping off remaining cure. Save 2 TBs wet cure + 6 TB brown sugar for final crust, + vinegar or pickling liquid for a paste.  Cook over 'rack' of celery /carrot/onions. When start basting, add water to pan to keep juices from crusting and ease clean up.<br/>In addition to sauces , rice, lettuce, can add the roasted veg and do a quick pickled daikon/ carrot . Just can't get into the oysters.","1506867060","15"
"30860791","Mara Thompson","This is so good!  I have made it several times for friends, family, and out of the country family, that hail from the capital of the ""carnitas"" epicenter in Mexico and know a great pork dish.  I did not add salt to the last sugar caramel step, since it was salty enough.  The sauces are a must, if you're doing ""tacos"". We serve with the lettuce, corn tortillas and an additional Asian/Mexican chile de arbol and sesame hot sauce.  Run to the grocery store and get the ingredients to make this!","1551495881","15"
"100104987","Tif","I’ve had bo ssam at Momofuku Ssam Bar several times. It is solid. This super simple recipe is all over the internet, so I was surprised at the lack luster average ratings and reviews.  As others have mentioned, the confusion comes in the very first step with the amount of kosher salt. It seems most chefs use diamond crystal brand, which due to the crystal structure is much less salty. So if you use a different salt, cut the amount in half. Do not scrape the mixture off before cooking. Enjoy!","1555780635","15"
"109000093","BruniBomb","I LOVE this recipe, but used shrimp instead of pork and white bread with Hawaiian Punch and hornel chili sauce instead of ssam and substituted Peter Lugars sauce with the strawberry jelly.  So basically perfect.","1599414873","15"
"21688624","jenfalv","No wiping!!!  But must use Diamond Crystal Kosher salt; otherwise too salty. Have made this 3 times now, and it really is pork crack!  I think I may try the first part in the crock pot, per others' suggestion--will let y'all know how it goes. A bit trepidatious about messing with perfection, but would like to try, so perhaps I could make this and not be at all anxious about leaving the oven on all day.","1507132634","13"
"25353813","Geoff Last","I have made this before and it is delicious but since I have recently acquired an Instant-Pot (like half the world apparently) I was wondering how it would turn out using the pressure cooker feature.","1514411037","13"
"28164392","Michael","Instead of using the oven, I cooked the pork butt in an Instant Pot for 90 minutes on high pressure. In addition to the 90 mins of cooking time, it took approximately 30 mins to come to pressure and about an hour to release pressure naturally, so about 3 hours total to get the meat super tender. I also cut the 9lb pork butt in half, which was the perfect amount to feed four hungry adults.","1533771404","13"
"29585002","Peggy","Cooking this now and it smells so good! I'm curious about the ginger scallion ""sauce"". I wouldn't call it a sauce since it's very dense with scallions and very little liquid. Is 2 1/2 CUPS of scallions correct or is this a typo?","1543669707","13"
"29772216","Andy","-6.5 lb. bone-in pork shoulder.  -Used brown sugar in 1st rub, refrigerated about 20 hrs.  -Added Chinese 5 spice several times while cooking.  -Cooked 6 hrs at 300°F. -Rested 55 min.  -Added some 5 spice to 2nd rub. -Finished for 10 min at 500° -Served with all listed condiments, but no oysters.   Excellent   ","1545020777","13"
"18177103","Misun","For Ssam sauce, try mayonnaise (optional teaspoonful of sesame oil) insteal of oil. It makes the sauce more savory. You can add chopped nuts (i recommend pecan and walnut) and sesame as well.","1508873989","12"
"21619318","trexgirl","I have made this a dozen times to great acclaim!  Super easy and so very tasty.  I use the leftovers to make friend rice the next day, the Mark Bittman way and wow, almost worth it to cook this just for the leftovers.  Today, I varied it by cooking it on my Traeger grill and it was even better.  remember to rinse before cooking and it won't be salty.  If you want more input into this recipe, Martha Stewart has a video of David Chang cooking it.","1508865710","12"
"29870297","paulpegg","I have made this many times. I generally mix 1/2 cup each of kosher salt and regular sugar and rub it on the meat to make a thin coating. I discard the rest of salt/sugar mix if there is any left over. I do not rub it off when it goes in the 300F oven and it is not too salty. I put the brown sugar/salt on at the end and put it under the low broiler for a few minutes until the sugar bubbles. Do not walk away or you could easily ruin the dish at this point. EVERYONE LOVES IT!  ","1545593011","12"
"17528060","Dan","Not for the gochujang -- that's a central flavor in Korean food. You could use miso for the ssamjang though. And both are fermented and shelf-stable, so it'd be safe to buy them from Amazon or something.","1508869288","11"
"19157933","gary","Try to cook at 300 for 8 or more hours, not the 6 stated in the recipe, at least if the pork butt is in the 10 lb range.  Keep the fat on top to let it drip through during the cooking process.  The final 500 degree cooking step is very important -- for both flavor (more sweetness to accompany the  saltiness in the meat underneath) and texture (crispiness to go with tenderness below).  Use rakiyo (Japanese pickled scallions) and spicy bread and butter pickles for additional accompaniments.","1508880329","11"
"20966340","Dana","omg SAVE THE FAT. You can roast yam chips and spears in it and they are delicious. I put a tablespoon or so on a cookie sheet, melted it in the oven while it was heating (400degrees) then tossed the chips in it. Be prepared for the animals in your house to stare at you beseechingly while the fat melts.","1508859063","11"
"21431255","Doug Johnston","Reading the comments, I am baffled by the negative responses--particularly from the folks who said the end result was too salty. I can only assume they either failed to clean the brine off the shoulder before cooking it--or used too fine a grain of salt.<br/><br/>I have been cooking this for parties--since the recipe first appeared--the dish has always been a big hit.<br/><br/>My only tweak(s) to the recipe has been to go with a lower/slower oven (250) and to be vigilant about the progress of the meat.","1508865926","11"
"22394669","camiller","always add a few teaspoons 5 spice to the salt/sugar cure. Cook without wiping, save 2 tablespoons of the wet cure at the bottom of the bowl and + 6 tbs brown sugar for the final crust- add a little cider vinegar or pickling juice to help it stick if needed. Add water to the pan when start basting at an hour and minimal cleanup.<br/>Quick pickled carrot/ daikon is a great additional side.","1506867070","11"
"26562801","Lisa","I’ve made this a bunch of times and everyone loves it. I’ve found that you can put it in a 250 degree oven in the morning before you go to work and it’s done when you’re ready for dinner. I’ve left it as long as 12 hours and I’ve never had a problem.  ","1522625077","11"
"104401135","BLC","This is easier than it should be, given how delicious it is. I used a couple of the tips from the comments. Lined the roasting pan with parchment, which make clean-up a breeze. Covered the pan with foil, while roasting, to keep it moist. Added 2 tsp cider vinegar to sugar mixture in step 6, which helped it to adhere and develop a beautiful, tasty crust. Also de-fatted and saved the drippings for future use.","1577981804","11"

"110844129","Margot","I've never commented on a recipe before, but I benefitted enormously from reading the many comments here before making this dish for the very first time after years of returning to this recipe time and again. Because of y'all, I used apple cider vinegar to make a paste, lined the pan with foil, and halved the sugar/salt rub (don't remove excess). So here I am, paying it forward: do all of those things, and accompany with sushi rice specifically. That's it. A miraculous meal. Happy New Year.","1609480882","10"

"15588721","Jill","I have made this several times -- it's an all day deal so I plan ahead.  Best to use a high quality pork butt with most of the fat off.  That way, you get the best of the delicious crust and not so much fat when you use it.  I start with lettuce tacos then move to tortillas later in the week.  The sauces and finishing at 500 are a must.","1509371950","9"

"15869238","Lyn","This is excellent for feeding a crowd. Even though the recipe did not specify it, I wiped off all the excess cure (there was a lot) before roasting. I added a little grated ginger, garlic and crushed star anise to the cure as well for a little flavour boost. <br/><br/>A fan-forced low oven at 150 celcius, was syill quite hot, as it burnished it a deep brown two hours into the cook.

The sauce is better with less oil, more like a loose salsa. Toasted sesame seeds for next time<br/>--6 hours at 275 was plenty of time. I got the caramelized bark without the brown sugar step, so I skipped that<br/>--It's crazy delicious","1506881406","8"
"23718533","George","It's hard to imagine 1:1 ratio of salt and sugar working for this recipe..but it does! I used a boneless butt and it worked perfectly. I highly recommend buying the pork from a reputable butcher or from a Whole Foods. It may be 3X more expensive (about $40), but the quality and marbling of the pork was phenomenal. Finally, separate the fat from the juices and pour it on the dryer pieces of pork. Very flavorful!","1506883633","8"
"29787177","s. lee","Excellent and so so easy.  I misread the ingredients list and instead bought a 10lb boneless butt... so probably nearly double the quantity of meat!   I adjusted the seasonings and sides and was still completely eaten out of the house by 13 people.   Next time I will make 4x the sauces, definitely let the roast sit outside to cool to make it easier to add brown sugar crust, and I’ll try that tip of adding cider vinegar to make the brown sugar stick.  Served simple noodles in broth afterwards ","1545118108","8"
"30454282","Lisa","Continued.. • Line the pan with foil.  • I skipped the last step because, after the 6 hours, the top was crispy and brown. If I'd cooked it more it would have been burnt. It was also plenty salty. The NYT article talks about the ""skin"" puffing up in the last cooking. My roast had no skin, only a layer of fat. I didn't know to ask for the skin to be left on since the recipe doesn't mention that. It was fantastic with no skin and just the fat layer which renders and just leaves a crisp top.","1549211266","8"

I'm not adverse to salt, I'm in fact the opposite, so this surprised me!  I think it allowed the pork flavor to come through.  I love it with all the fixings, including the fresh oysters.

Didn't create caramelised crust with salt brown sugar mix as didn't have time and still meat was incredibly good. Enough to feed 3 adults 1st night; and 2 adults each 2 leftover dinners. As everyone says, scallion ginger sauce is made for this roasted pork. Ssam sauce good but overshadowed by scallion ginger. Bibb lettuce very nice. I served Hex brand kimchi from Baltimore MD, which was perfect! Nov 2017","1511638688","7"
"26203838","Easy win","Used the apple cider vinegar trick (1 T/7 T brown sugar). Careful not to burn!  Started in the slow cooker @212F (high on mine) for four hours while I ran errands, then finished in the oven @300F until collapsed.   The ginger scallion sauce seemed dry, so I halved the ratio of scallions to the rest of the recipe. Also, had to triple the quantity of it (7.5 c of scallions, x6 the rest). It is like crack. Need to keep a supply in the fridge for hubby now.   Can’t really mess this up. ","1520205026","7"
"26653436","Jeremy","Wow - great recipe. I used a 4-5 lb roast for 4 people - took off a bit of the excess salt and sugar prior to cooking in a Dutch oven (no cover) at 300 F for 5-6 hours, then with the brown sugar rub for 15-20 minutes at 475 F. The braising might not be needed, but I checked every hour for scorching and had to add a bit of water to the bottom of the pan. You do NOT need any extra spices in the rub - just salt and sugar and pork. The sauces (the GREEN ONOIN SAUCE!!) have a TON of flavor.","1523287725","7"
"31426023","Tom","The meat itself, you could pair with any decent red that you like with a roast.  The trick here is the garnishes.  Strong Asian flavors, delightful yes, but finding a wine is tricky.  Kimchee and the scallion-ginger sauce seem to want a crisp, non-oaky white like a good Chablis or Sancerre.  But those would disappoint with the robust pork.  I prefer this meal with lager, and open the Brunello after dinner.","1554615422","7"
"100185248","Wine Guy from Iowa","I agree with Tom: that it has to do with the garnishes. For the savory pork itself, a robust rosé like a Tavel from France's Rhône Valley, would be perfect. But for my money, the best wines for pairing with tricky partners come from Alsace. If your accompaniments are on the spicy side, go with an Alsatian Gewurztraminer (full-bodied, and on the slightly sweet side, to balance with the spice). If your sides are more briney and acidic, like kim-chi, try a dry Alsatian Riesling or Pinot Blanc.","1556235447","7"

If I didn't have things like this to look forward to, quarantine would have my soul.   One other thing.

I did wash most of the salt (3/4 cup) off the joint before putting it in the oven and was glad I did, as I think it was salty enough in the end. I cooked it at 275 and covered it for 90 minutes, and I think the steam helped it get super tender. It was uncovered for the last 90 minutes.

I've only cooked this once but I did my research prior. Discarded all the juices and the remaining salt after brining for 36 hrs. My roast came out fine because of this step. I also covered it with foil the first hour but decided to uncover and baste because I wanted it to brown.

Authentic? Perhaps not, but the sauce was the star of the show.  Had a 5lb shoulder.

I don't think I'd add salt to the sauces as the pastes in the ssam sauce are probably salty enough.    Hmmm my first reaction was NO!  Now I'm reconsidering.  :-)  ","1548030182","3"

"102994422","Mags","I made this and will make it again.  My 8lbs of meat shrunk to about 4 after removing the bones. The outside burned but I was able to rub char off.  As-is this is ALL ABOUT THE SAUCE.  I had homemade kimchi, ssam sauce, and the ginger scallion sauce, sweet soy with garlic chili sauce.  I'll take the suggestions found here: add 5 spice, cook less/cover partially if I can't find actual skin on(I thought the fat cap was skin) and reduce the temperature to 250 to 275. Worth trying!","1570592335","3"

"110854049","Katie","I made this during New Years week and it turned out delicious. A few notes I wanted to add based on the reviews. I made a 4.92lb bone in pork butt, it took about 6 hours to cook. I highly recommend you use a disposable roasting pan for seamless cleanup and place the meat fat cap up. The ginger scallion sauce is a do not miss addition and something we used a few days after on bo ssam tacos for leftovers. Highly recommend!","1609557100","3"
"115677254","HUGE hit with picky teenagers","THIS is why it helps read the reviews! I usually get a smaller piece and have had a few misses because of time to size ratio. Saw someone suggested setting the temp to 275 for 6 hours and it was PERFECT!!!","1638150705","3"
"115790739","Rose","On three separate occasions, with three separate groups of people, three people completely crushed 3.5 lb bone-in pork shoulders made per recipe (once in crock pot, until last step), served as lettuce “tacos”, sadly, no oysters. After the first delicious feast, I learned to double the ginger/scallion sauce, it is amazing. Spectacularly good, and an messy “event” to eat with friends.  Beer and g&t’s to drink, lots of sparkling water, loads of napkins, fruit for dessert. A quadruple triple.","1638809416","3"
"116067078","Oliver","For the life of me I can't tell whether 'skin' refers to the physical skin on the pork butt or the crust that forms after the final broil. It's only mentioned after the latter step, and in Chang's demo with Marth Stuart there doesn't appear to be any skin on the cut of meat. Sam Sifton however in the comments seems to refer to it as being 'skin on' from the butcher. Any opinions from the crowd?","1640381488","3"
"118322605","Taylor","I had a 4lb pork shoulder and was nervous about overcooking it. I cooked it at 285 for the first 4 hours and for the last 2, lowered to 265 & covered with foil. Turned out beautifully! Truly wait for that ""deflated football"" look. You might think it's done sooner, but it's not! I chopped the pork up carnitas style and served on a wooden board. Everyone kept picking at the caramelized bits of pork until it was gone. I supplemented the spread with grilled gojuchang shrimp in favor of the oysters.","1652545618","3"
"118528736","Nick Corcodilos","Every time I make this, I do the first 60-90 minutes in the smoker, using mesquite or apple wood. If you have a smoker, try this. It adds a deep flavor you can't get in the oven. This is my favorite crowd-pleaser recipe!","1653660290","3"
"118547582","CVilla","One of my favorite recipes to prepare! Disclaimer: under no circumstance should you use a cup of Morton Kosher. I made the fatal mistake of thinking Diamond Crystal and Morton’s were interchangeable. Needless to say, it was inedible going down. Now I know that Diamond Crystal is the only salt to be applied. During summer if you’re feeling festive, baste it with pineapple juice, brown sugar, and gochujang. You won’t be sorry!","1653756590","3"
"120392837","MainLineMike","Made this for dinner tonight, but since I live in a kosher home, it required some adjustment. Instead of the pork butt, I used a beef shoulder roast. To make it tender, I cooked it in the sous vide for 48 hours, and threw it on the grill for the final caramelizing of the sugar. Also used tortillas instead of the lettuce since lettuce cups get kinda messy. Huge hit. It will be on the meal plan again.","1663118850","3"
"124227648","KR","People! Stop using table salt when a recipe calls for kosher. You’re blaming the recipe and it’s no one’s fault but your own. Just buy kosher salt for cooking and use it when the recipe calls for it. If you insist on Morton table salt when the recipe calls for kosher, you’re going to want to dial that back, sometimes by half. This is cooking 101, folks.","1680713280","3"
"128203993","Mark Eckstrom","For years, this has been our go-to dinner party recipe. Most everything can be prepped in advance and the only last minute detail is the caramelization before serving. There’s one serving modification we’ve made that is a game changer: Trader Joe Jicama Wraps instead of Bibb lettuce leaves. Lettuce tends to break and get messy while jicama wraps hold their shape and give an essential textural crunch to each bite. And the time saved in prep is terrific as well. We highly recommend this switch!","1696428094","3"

"25647144","Lily Blank","I think the solution for that is to take it out and let it do the resting phase. Probably 30 minutes is best. That allows the top to cool enough to hold the brown sugar mixture when you put it back in, and time for the meat to settle (which is what the resting phase is for).","1516578844","2"
"25947708","Joe","One step that always helps a glaze adhere to meat is to pat the meat dry with paper towels to absorb any excess grease. Eliminating this grease will prevent the glaze from just running off.","1518550973","2"
"27304361","Christopher","Absolutely the same experience I had. Diamond or nothing with this recipe, as the amazing skin is ruined with other salts (at least with Morton).","1527904252","2"
"28198953","val","Don’t use the degreaser sauces-maybe a bit of the apple cider vinegar for final rub.  Half the sugar and salt-try wiping off the rub before you cook the meat.","1534041518","2"
"111083978","coffeespoon","Tried earlier w/5 lb roast but it came out tough and dry. Next try: -Diamond kosher salt 1/4 cup and 1/4 cup sugar - it melted into the roast overnight -8 lb roast, 300 degrees x 10 hours, internal temp monitoring to achieve 200 degrees  -Apple cider vinegar and brown sugar for final step -The meat was amazing!! Low and slow makes it super easy. Only thing - I didn't baste or cover with foil so the fat cap/skin got inedibly hard. Will probably try foil on until last 2 hrs on next go around.","1610573583","2"
"111471579","Nan","Even a 3.5 lb roast makes an incredible amount. The slow cooker method works  in 6 - 7 hours, time so it isn't left on warm much longer. Mixed brown sugar with sherry vinegar for the crust, that worked. Made the black bean sauce without the chili paste and was delicious. Used less green onions and ginger and it worked great.","1612758784","2"
"111663270","me","Brine 2 days prior, brush off (not rinse) before roast. 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar to brown sugar paste. Ssam sauce needed more gochujang and honey, otherwise too acidic. Food process scallion ginger sauce","1613775942","2"
"111671631","DW","Made this last night.  Fantastic!     Had a 5 lb 1/2 pork shoulder.  Used 1/8 cup kosher (Morton’s) salt and 1/4 cup sugar and left overnight.   Cooked 6 hours, rested 40 minutes and then did mix a tiny bit of apple cider vinegar with the brown sugar and salt  and then 10 minutes at 500.   Do use a disposable pan. Did not smoke my kitchen.   Did not include oysters or kimchi but did serve sesame noodles and cucumber salad along side.    Super easy and delicious.","1613841345","2"
"113057982","Laurie","Have made this many, many times, ever since the NYT first ran it (2012?) and it's always a big hit.  And, yes, the recommendation from another poster to triple the amount of ginger-scallion sauce is spot on. It's the perfect balance for the rich pork and folks do use a lot of it...me included. I also make it without the kimchi and oysters if I can't get them.","1622391355","2"
"114496375","CK","The scallion ginger sauce - so simple but so tasty! I found the ssam sauce a bit thin so spooned half out and added more of the two pastes plus a tsp minced garlic and tsp sesame oil.","1631502234","2"

"116193999","Sammy Z","I did the glaze he describes in his new book instead of packing it with brown sugar. It was amazing.   Pour off the pork fat into a bowl with a cup of brown sugar and some salt. Whisk. Try to get it to a honey-like consistency that you can paint onto the butt. I loosened it was a tiny bit of water. Paint and blast at 500 for 20 minutes. It’s awesome.","1641312134","2"

"118514386","Mark M","I love this recipe, but I rarely have enough guests to justify a full batch.  So, I tried a modification.  I bought a two-pound boneless pork shoulder, and used the same recipe, with two modifications:   I sealed it in foil for the first round of cooking, to try to prevent it from drying out.  Took off the foil at 4 hours and only cooked it for a total of 5 hours, then the 15 minutes at 500.  Turned out great.  Also tried substituting white miso for the ssamjang!  Not so fine....","1653592806","2"
"118784640","Grace","I've made this twice, once as written (but halved) and another in a slow cooker. The slow cooker was better, so sharing if it's helpful: 3.5 pound boneless shoulder. Halved salt in initial rub (i.e. 1/6c salt to 1/3c sugar for 3.5 pds), 12 hrs. Browned sides in a pan over medium heat, ~1-2m each side. Slow cooker on low for 7 hrs. Finished as written. Suggestion to add apple cider vinegar to brown sugar worked great. Previously, it all ran off and burned, setting off smoke alarms","1655056389","2"
"118789745","Hanna","Way too salty. I had a 5.7 lbs pork shoulder, so I cut the salt/sugar to 1/2 cup each and I used Diamond brand. let it marinate overnight, rinsed off excess salt and baked it at 290F for 5+ hours. Tender but inedible by itself due to the saltines. I cut it into 8oz portions, froze it. Hate to waste all that meat so I plan to use it in street tacos, egg rolls or other inspirations to dilute the saltiness.","1655082574","2"
"121199396","ea","Fat up when roasting. Don’t need a rack but aluminum yes. 4.6lb boneless was just enough for 4 adults and 2 kids. double scallion sauce.  8 hours at 250.","1667042408","2"

"122321782","Carl","Have made this 5 times, and i love it. You should really use a meat thermometer. The perfect temp to eat the pork is 204 degrees. Take the pork out at 195 or so and let it rest and come up to temp.  It does get very smokey and scorches the roasting pan a bit but its worth it when you cook it fully to temp.","1672596565","2"
"128934509","SM","Loved the way the meat turned out but (don’t hate me) we didn’t care for the sauces. Think next time we’ll serve with a Japanese cucumber salad as someone suggested.","1699063229","2"

I started it off with 2 hours on my smoker at 225, then 6 hours at 300 in the oven, basting every hour after I put it in the oven, then 500 for 10 mins with the brown sugar/salt. Turned out perfect!","1724563767","2"
