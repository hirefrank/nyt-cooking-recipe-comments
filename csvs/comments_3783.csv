"19627155","Mary","Hi - I'd like clarification on the flour --- 1 C flour, sifted - is that one cup of flour and sift and add, or sift the flour to equal one cup of flour - makes a difference.   Thank you.","1508881561","3443"
"16636410","Jan Wong","In 1988 my Toronto newspaper was about to post me to Beijing as a foreign correspondent. Alas, my house wasn't selling. I'd read that the fragrance of baking helps so I bought a frozen loaf of bread, and warmed it in the oven. No sale. Desperate, I baked this torte for an open house. Ta-dah! With the kitchen infused with the sweet perfume of Original Plum Torte, the house sold.","1509377357","2224"

"27762757","Yury","Hello, i'm from Russion Federation. This is exellent. I'm cooced it every weekend. My children very liked this pie. I not very well know English. Sorry for mistake. From Russia with love ;)","1530959696","1395"
"15894646","John","Made this last night after tasting the one made by our daughter.  Used raspberries and blackberries, one basket each, instead of plumbs, and 1/3 c. cornmeal and 2/3 c. flour.  Fantastic!!!  The cornmeal adds a very sophisticated ""Italian"" character to it, very slight crunch, and amazing flavor.  Topped with coarse sugar before baking.  Did this in a motorhome convection oven for 50 minutes.  Perfect dessert with whipped cream, flavored with a few pureed berries and sugar/vanilla.  So easy!","1509373370","1057"
"19704177","Marty","This was GREAT.  Sliced the plums and arranged them in a fan pattern -- better than halves because prettier and more evenly distributed over cake.  Added lemon zest and sliced slivered almonds.  Next time I would toss the plums in the lemon juice, lemon zest, sugar, almonds, and cinnamon, because the cinnamon and the zest clumped up when sprinkled.  Will also experiment with other fruits.","1508884468","778"
"15474338","juleezee","A nice recipe for Obstkuchen, the German-speaking bakers' classic! I grew up on this cake and have been making it for many, many years now. It can be made with any neutral vegetable oil too. Use any kind of nice fruit or berries, just make sure that they are firm, otherwise they can release too much juice during baking. Also, grease the the round or square pan, line the bottom with parchment and grease that one too. No springform required, but it's nice if you have one.","1509371779","534"
"18022257","J. David Nelson","A 9"" pan gives greater height and moisture to the tart than a 10"" pan.","1508872318","519"
"19757763","Jen in Astoria","Note:  My Mom makes this all the time and it's a family and guest favorite.  It freezes PHENOMENALLY well--her usual tactic is to wait until it's cool, then into the fridge, THEN when it's really cool you wrap it first in plastic wrap and then in foil REALLY well, like you're launching it into space, and then into the freezer.  Also works for leftover torte.  If you have more than 1 springform pan make 2 and freeze one for Emergency Company Cake.","1508884074","510"
"16343339","Cris","A delicious and indeed elegant torte. I have made it twice with these alterations: 50% almond meal; 50%brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. It also freezes well.","1509376166","425"
"16970085","MsBlucher","Torte, schmorte. It's a delicious, homey dessert you can bake in just about anything - though a springform pan does make for a somewhat ritzier presentation - and top with whatever fruit is in season. My Polish mother made it in a rectangular metal pan all summer long (mmm...placek!), though the household favorite WAS the Italian/prune plum iteration. She used grated lemon rind and 1 t. vanilla in the batter, tightly-spaced skin-side down fruit, and ground cloves instead of cinnamon atop.","1509378218","404"
"19596185","Bohemian","Plums must have been a lot smaller in 1982. I only needed 4 plums (8 halves).<br/><br/>The size of the pan is also going to affect cooking time, rise height, and so on.  I used a 9"" pan and increased the recipe for the batter to 1 1/2 times.  Perfect.<br/><br/>It only took 45 minutes to cook.  It would have burned if I'd left it an hour like it said.  I could smell it and tested with a toothpick and stopped at 45 minutes when it came out clean.","1508881499","384"

"16097468","Ela","My favorite recipe from NYT - annual ritual for 20 years!<br/>Baked with - apricots, apples and cranberries when off season.<br/>Also used half whole wheat flour and was perfect. This year sliced the plums  thinly and layerd tightly like rose petals - still the best.","1509374981","324"
"20237309","hermsoven","Even better with this trick:<br/>• Fill a six cup cupcake pan with liners.<br/>• Fill liners evenly with batter (about 3/4 full)<br/>• Top the 6 unbaked cupcakes with your favorite berry or berry mix and press into the batter. Don't over fill. Sprinkle lightly with cinnamon.<br/>• Bake @350°F for 35-40 minutes or until tops are nicely browned.<br/>• Allow to cool and serve.","1508885278","239"
"19697812","Debbie","I've been making this recipe for 20 years. Wouldn't be the bittersweet change of season without it. When those first cooler days signal the coming of autumn I go to the market for Italian prune plums,pull out this recipe and remember everything is going to be alright.","1508883519","236"
"16539746","cynthia","My aunt used to make this and it's still wonderful.  Agree with others--30 minutes. Make it in any pyrex, casserole, anything.  Any fruit works. This time, I did frozen, unsweetened cherries.  I reduce to 1/2 cup sugar and sometimes could use even less.  No reason to roll pie crust--just make this!","1509376818","204"
"19772610","Lisa F.","I've made this many, many times, always in a regular cake pan.  A springform is not required!  I also find it better to cut the plums into quarters or eighths as they are then more bite size in the torte.","1508884406","202"
"19841969","Zoe Gerard","I calculated the nutritional value of this torte as described above. Using 3/4 cup sugar, the entire torte comes to about 2,100 calories, or about 260 calories per generous slice, if you divide the pie up in 8. To put it in perspective, most of the cakes sold at Starbucks pack almost twice as much calories per serving.","1508884249","146"
"16004819","linh","i have been making this torte since the recipe was first given, with prune plums, with nectarines, apples/cranberries, and also peaches - they are delicious, easy, freeze well and make fine gifts - but i always put the plums skins down and find the cakes more attractive and bake as well.  love it!","1509374462","145"
"19794138","Pat","I freeze plums while they are plentiful, by halving lengthwise, removing pits and freezing on a baking sheet before bagging - thus available all winter for this and other uses.","1508883796","145"
"16075762","Robin","This was so easy and as lovely as everyone has written. I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a teaspoon of almond extract. Also added peaches when the plums ran out. Fabulous recipe! Thank you Marian Burros.","1509374424","144"
"20081766","Ben","Went with:<br/><br/>- half cup of sugar, 50/50 white/dark brown<br/><br/>- 50/50 almond flour/white flour<br/><br/>- 28 plum halves<br/><br/>- 10"" skillet (hey, use what you got)<br/><br/>- zest of 1 lemon in batter<br/><br/>- 40 minutes in oven.<br/><br/>Came out fantastic. And surprisingly, even with those changes, looked exactly like the picture. Seriously flexible, bulletproof recipe.","1508886386","134"
"19773494","Jane Wolchonok","Not only have I been making this since 1983, I have the original clipping from the NYTimes and treasure it!  I was charmed then and still am with the story of Marian making these and freezing them at her friend's house and the friend's mother eating them.  I've passed the recipe on to more people than I can count, and most importantly, to my daughter-in-law.  It's a treasure!  Thank you, Marian.","1508884186","125"

"19796089","Laurie","I love this recipe and have been making it every year since 1989.  Great for breakfast or in the afternoon with coffee.  For a dessert, I add some whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.<br/>  I have a couple minor adjustments:<br/>---I first add the eggs and 1/2 tsp almond extract to the creamed butter and sugar, then add the dry ingredients.  It blends much more smoothly that way.<br/>---I use whole wheat pastry flour, which is so finely ground that texture is the same but you have more fiber","1508883621","115"
"15967517","Jane F","Made this for the first time using 4 cups of blueberries and raspberries (mixed). It was perfect!","1509374624","108"
"15807804","Loretta","Great recipe, I can see why it's a classic. Added 1/2 cup of ground almonds as someone suggusted. Replaced some of the white sugar with Demerara sugar. Added some almond extract and sprinkled the top with vanilla sugar. It was delicious. Will definitely make it again","1509372741","105"
"19839433","Jessie","I've made this twice in the last two weeks -- once with plums and once with peaches. Both times I added vanilla and a bit of cardamom. Delicious. More fruit is better. And the best thing is how quickly this can be thrown together.<br/><br/>BTW I never sift flour. This worked out just fine without that step.","1508883625","103"
"107170446","Rick Liebeskind","In my family, we believed that this recipe was the creation of my grandmother, Alice Liebeskind. In one version, your coauthor Lois Levine  (Alice’s niece and my cousin) liberated the recipe from Alice’s recipe box when she died in December 1976.  I don’t remember Alice’ ever saying explicitly that it was her recipe, but she certainly left that impression.  That impression was confirmed when you claimed (on the umpteenth printing of the recipe in the Times, (more...)","1590085221","103"

"19833407","Ellen","I am kosher and would like to serve this torte on Rosh Hashanah. Can I use a butter substitute or oil instead of the butter? Will it be as good or should I forget the pot roast and go dairy!","1508883954","85"
"19842592","Theresa","I just made this exactly per the recipe in a 10 in. springform pan.  It was delicious, however my Italian plum halves (skin side up) fully sank and did not have the beautiful appearance as the NYT photo.  Any tips?  Could it be that I used extra large eggs vs large eggs?  Should I coat my plums in flour before placing them in?  Does skin side down help it to stay on top?","1508883786","83"
"19841548","Bee","I bet this recipe could be made in a cast iron skillet.","1508884218","76"
"16995849","Randy","You would have to rehydrate the dried fruit before using or you would end up with jerky. But the possibility of using some flavorful liquids to soak the dried fruits (rum, brandy, triple sec, port, fruit juice) adds some intriguing possibilities. Soak the fruit for at least 4 hrs. and drain before using. This could turn into a great winter dessert...","1509378456","74"
"23957437","Lee Norris","Marian Burros' original recipe called for Italian prune plums. I'd like an answer from The Times as to why this was changed. No wonder ""Bohemian"" surmised that plums must have been smaller in 1983. Italian prune plums ARE smaller, and very different in texture, taste, and appearance than the gigantic American plums.","1508764053","73"
"30550656","SSSumi","The amount of fruit determines how long you should bake. Only have a handful of blueberries or raspberries? 40 minutes is all you need. Wanna dump several overripe peach or plum slices on top? You’ll need the full hour. This brilliant recipe morphs to accommodate whatever you have in mind, turning into a sturdy cake with a crisp top or a molten fruit buckle, with variations in between, depending on the fruit used.","1549773472","68"
"19800118","Alan Mayer-Sommer","Just when the torte comes out of the oven, I glaze the top with apricot preserves.","1508883761","65"
"19905987","Katherine","I tried this using only almond meal, no flour, and the result was a completely delectable gluten-free dessert.","1508883830","64"
"18583827","Charles","An additional quarter cup of almond meal (or flour) is useful if you have particularly juicy fruit. (I used some very fine apricots from Frog Hollow Farm.) Otherwise they tend to sink to the bottom. Additional sugar sprinkled on top of the fruit is a good idea if using abricots--vanilla sugar is ideal. Great recipe; thank you, New York Times.","1508876453","61"
"19627292","Mary","What I did differently from the above basic recipe was:<br/><br/>Cut  plums into slivers, perhaps 8-10 slices out of a large plum.  Tumble them in a bowl where,  prepared in advance:  brown sugar, saigon cinnamon, & tiny bits of butter. Vanilla in the cake batter.    Then individually place each sliver in spirals to make an attractive design. If thin, overlap the slivers.    Sprinkled a bit more cinnamon on top.<br/><br/>With the plums slivered it is easier to cut and neater to serve, plus looks attractive.","1508882369","58"
"15664123","Eric Ligon","I made this last night. Very tasty. I increased the butter by 1/4 cup and added an additional 1/2 cup of ground almonds. Delicious.","1509372699","55"
"24028957","Katarina","This is a non-fussy, versatile European dessert. No need for butter, simple olive oil works fine. No need for a spring-form, any pan will do, just grease it (and perhaps dust with flour). The problem is the flour - the all-purpose flour is too finely ground to hold up in this cake and will make it gooey. 3/4 cup of all purpose and 1/4 cup of semolina flour works. Also, half a cup of sugar is enough. Finally, it will take less than 1 hour to bake at 350, do the first check at 40 minutes... Enjoy!","1508765262","55"
"15867983","Gail","I added a teaspoon of finely minced fresh rosemary to the batter....nice, subtle flavor.  The torte disappeared rapidly once served....better make two next time!","1509372866","53"
"23945577","Kathleen","I have made this torte hundreds of times since cutting it out of the Times in 1983.  Recently however, the cake batter seems to bake over the fruit and I don't get the lovely circles of plums, apples, etc that I have spent so much time arranging.  Is there something that I am doing wrong that is causing this ?","1508765187","52"
"18707774","Janice","This recipe needs no modifications. It is perfect as it is.","1508876983","46"
"19833581","lupi","I make 2 at a time using 8 inch pans. I start every fall with four of these in the freezer. Thaw overnight removing foil while torte is frozen solid. Warm in oven and serve with a glob of greek yoghurt on each slice. Fabulous. If only my grandmother were here to enjoy it.","1508884220","42"
"15834810","AnneC","I have been making this torte for years.  It's one of my favorites!<br/>Variations:<br/>Use apricots instead of plums, but add a bit of nutmeg along with cinnamon.<br/>Use peaches, but peel them or they get tough.","1509372845","41"
"15339905","T.M. Bennett","As with many others, I have made this for more than 30 years.  Last fall there were no Italian purple plums in the NY and MA markets where I shop, so suggestions for alternate fruits would be helpful. For B. Wheeler, the recipe calls for 12 plums (24 halves), which it always takes.  Great recipe.","1509370752","39"
"19796874","Ann","I have made this since I was a bride in 1968 when I bought the Elegant but Easy Cookbook paperback for 95 cents. I have made it with all kinds of fruit. 3 weeks ago it was blueberries. They are my favorite because they sink into the batter. For a dinner party this Sunday I think I will do apples because of the beautiful design when you fan the slices. It is a great recipe no matter what you call it.","1508883405","39"
"19866912","Patrick Chadd","Beautiful, simple and delicious - Used the cup of sugar but it wasn't too sweet at all.  I sprinkled it with white sugar and fresh Meyer lemon juice and after it baked for an hour; Then sprinkled the top with sparkling sugar.  Fresh whipped, barely sweetened cream was a perfect accompaniment.  Delicious.  For those who are wondering, a good rule of thumb for a cup of flour is about 4.5 ounces.  You can measure then sift and mix.  4.5 ounces is 4.5 ounces so you'll never go wrong.","1508884236","39"
"17173914","Mona","It is absolutely delicious. The. Only thing I had to do was breathing the eggs very well until those are fluffy and adding those  gradually at the end. I used thawed dark cherries from Costco. It is a great easy and fast desert that slightly sweet and tart. It is a staple in my kitchen now and everybody love it.","1508868641","38"
"23952382","rebecca hayden","This is a perfect recipe and makes me nostalgic for the year I lived in Germany, where Pflaumkuchen is a late summer treat.  I add Fior di Sicilia extract (a combination of vanilla and citrus, and which is available from the King Arthur baking company) and a pinch of pulverized cardamom.  Adds real depth to the plum flavor.","1508764896","38"
"19773665","Barbara","I make this every year around this time, adding 1 teaspoon of almond extract, using 1/2 cup sugar in batter and slightly less than 1/2 cup sugar mixed with cinamon for topping.  Yum!","1508883768","36"
"23695698","uptowngirl154","I did two cakes on the same day using the same ingredients. The second one was higher and tastier. The secret? I warmed the butter in the microwave for 40 sec. It significantly increased the creamed butter volume!<br/><br/>My cake deflated a bit but I saw recommendations online to let it cool in the oven (with the oven turned off) for 15-20 min.","1506882076","36"
"23696304","susan p","This recipe is perfect!  While on vacation, I needed a dessert to take to a neighbor's house.  Summer cottages lack the usual culinary tools (no springform).  I went to the local market:  no italian plums, BUT, fresh, local figs.  I mixed up the batter, put it in a pie tin, laid the beautiful figs cut side up, brushed them with some white balsamic, and sprinkled them with a little bit of sugar.  It was a huge hit!","1506881650","34"
"24026351","KBOK","I make 1-1/2 times the recipe because I make this in a 10 inch springform pan and a single recipe comes out too thin for my taste.  I also add 1/2 teaspoon cardamom to the batter and skip the cinnamon in the topping because I love the flavor of cardamom and plums together.  It's a great yet simple recipe and especially good when prune plums are in season.","1508764518","34"
"14825553","Claire","This is a wonderful recipe that I have made many times and often freeze to have something sweet on hand.  I mostly skip the cinnamon because cinnamon is overused as a flavoring.  I have also made this with pluots (plum/apricots, with sliced peaches and with cherries.  All good.  The real beauty is how fast this quick dessert comes together with ingredients you have on hand plus fresh fruit.","1509368695","33"
"23974101","Karl","For newbies: this is designed for the firm blue-black prune plums one can find in many markets or backyards in the Northeast USA in September. They are small. Do not peel or blanch them. They become luscious jewels when baked. The real original recipe keeps well if well wrapped for many months in the freezer. Abandon any effort to sub ingredients to reduce calories. Just eat a smaller portion of something more delicious. Really simple.","1508764689","33"
"31403085","Marta","One caution - follow the recipe EXACTLY when it says ""place the plums on top"".  Don't be tempted to push them into the batter!  As the cake bakes, the batter puffs up around the fruit.  If you nestle the plums in too deeply you won't be able to see them on the top of the finished cake.","1554468736","33"
"15480351","Rebecca Love","Ah, cottage pudding.  Made this with overripe plums with cinnamon a week ago.  Today used a handful of blueberries and 3 chopped up fresh apricots.  Ginger and vanilla, brown sugar instead of white, whole wheat flour instead of white.  I like this recipe because it makes a smaller dessert than my old recipe.","1509371939","32"
"15900884","Chris Bradshaw","Used about 6-7 pluots and was delish and easy.  Try adding 1/2 c. almond meal.","1509373354","31"
"19774453","AJB","The key, the real key, is to slightly under-cook the Plum Torte. It's SO much better that way. Cooking all the way through can leave it a little dry.  Trust me, under-cook it and there's no whip cream or other topping necessary.","1508884079","31"
"28241938","betteirene","I used the little Italian prune plums that came in my box of Imperfect Produce.  I made three, one for a new neighbor and one for an old neighbor.  For the amount of love I gotten in return, this recipe is worth a thousand-fold more than its ingredients.","1534361041","31"
"19926642","Jen Lin-Liu","I live in Havana, Cuba, and tried this recipe with mangoes and it worked splendidly. I reduced the baking time by a few minutes and to spark up the presentation I would sprinkle it with a little powdered sugar. <a href=""http://www.jenlinliu.com"" title=""www.jenlinliu.com"" target=""_blank"">www.jenlinliu.com</a>.","1508883599","30"
"24099887","Steven","Latest variation I came up with is seriously amazing:<br/><br/>Swap out the plums for sliced pears (five or so); replace a quarter a cup of the AP flour with rye flour; add about a tablespoon each molasses, grated fresh ginger, and whiskey to the batter. Be generous with salt, and sprinkle with coarse turbinado sugar about halfway through baking.","1508764408","27"
"17794305","Jennifer Robinson","I have made this with about a quart of drained canned fruit of any type, as well as frozen. I can plums, peaches, and pears in season and if a jar fails to seal you can bake this cake with it rather than reprocess the jar.","1508872609","26"

"14828572","Barbara Wheeler","Like others, I've been making this since it first appeared in the paper, baking multiples during the short season for prune plums. Depending on plum size, it may not require 24 (in fact, it rarely does). Freezes beautifully. I do use the cinnamon--it does not overpower in this recipe. In my view, it is the best ""coffee cake"" and simple dessert ever--not too sweet, deeply flavorful.<br/><br/>Thanks, Cooking, for putting the recipe in a place where it is easy to retrieve. My clipping crumbled long ago....","1509368557","25"
"20282211","Francine","Alert!  This is an incredible recipe - and I've made it 3 times already - but the first time was using a springform pan that was 10"" and the cake wasn't nearly high enough.  So the next time, I doubled the recipe for the 10"" pan and it was perfect!","1508885013","25"

"19102167","Kelleryjones","This recipe was terrific! Super quick to put together with ingredients bakers and non bakers have on hand. I substituted fresh blueberries and nectarines and used my pie plate because my springform pan was no where to be found.

"15392802","Bernice Glenn","I've been preparing this recipe for at least  years -- and always thought it was basically a quick cottage cake. It makes it sound fancier to call it a torte -- because a torte by any other name would taste as sweet.<br/>A delicious recipe when plums are in season. I find that it is better to use plums that are not too ripe because the ripe ones loose a lot of their liquid to the cake batter when baking.","1509372034","21"

It's the difference between a Crosstrek (it'll get you where you want to go... and a Lexus...you'll think you floated to your destination). Thank you.","1600627335","6"

"136193523","Boehker","Marian Burros’s original recipe specified the use of 12 Italian prune plums (24 halves) and called for a 9-inch springform pan.  Italian plums are much smaller than standard plums, and are usually available only at the end of summer to early fall.  That’s why this torte is seen at this time of the year.  You can use other plums, but if they are larger than the small prune plums you won’t need 24 halves.  (Vaughn Vreeland’s video of this recipe on the Times Cooking app comments on how crazy it would be to use 24 large halves, but never mentions the original intention of using prune plums!).  Just saying, because I remember the original printing, and that recipe came out pretty much “plumb perfect”.","1726336837","6"

The changes I made: used BRM gluten-free all-purpose flour, earth balance butter, 3.5-4 cups chopped pineapple, added 1 tsp vanilla extract and 2 tsp grated fresh ginger to the creamed sugar/butter before adding other ingredients. I only used 1/2 cup of sugar and 20 minutes into baking drizzled a little honey on top. Baked for a total of 45 minutes in a lightly greased pyrex 9-inch pie plate. Turned out amazing!

I used less sugar than called for and would probably use even less next time.  Cake was done in about 45 minutes.  I tossed on some slivered almonds and baked 5 more minutes.

Also a note on the sturdiness of the plum…plums that are kind of soft (so 60-40 sturdy-soft) or softer can really ruin what would otherwise be a great and easy to make cake.

If you do prune/plum butter (has no fat, btw) reduce sugar accordingly.  Or, add one more egg, and reduce butter by 4T.  Texture will be different, but won't compromise the taste.","1536675518","3"

Over time I have tweaked the recipe, and found ways to make it easier to bake multiple cakes to freeze if there is a good crop of prune plums locally. A little almond extract in the batter, and cardamom sprinkled on top of the plums along with the cinnamon works very well. Also sometimes just use pie plate lined with parchment paper to bake. Easy!","1599850476","3"

I macerated mine in a quarter cup of sugar for about 12 hours (which yielded a lovely pink syrup for “quarentini” experiments) and I suspect that could have helped preserve the vibrant ruby color but was unnecessary.

I used six for a 9-inch springform pan and cut them in quarters. That was just the right amount, although I had bought nine plums. So today's version will be plums and peaches!  For dessert night I made whipped cream with some Chambord liqueur in it to add a little black raspberry kick.

"127718554","Dorot","Made a few changes and took suggestions from other notes: for batter ~ 1/4 cup brown sugar 1/4 cup cane sugar 1/2 teaspoon vanilla bean paste for topping ~ used lemon zest, brown sugar, cinnamon plums and nectarine (what was on hand) 8x8 baking dish Turned out delicious and not too sweet.","1694653866","2"
"127720752","Bonnie","I forgot the cinnamon sugar and lemon. Is that why I didn't go crazy for it? I loved the simplicity for sure. And it's darn good, but I wasn't gaga over it.","1694661497","2"
"127727502","JMB","Cooking time seems off…I set the timer for 40 min and it may be overcooked! Easy to make for sure!","1694698153","2"
"127732064","Dawn","Adding 1/2 tsp of almond extract made it heavenly!  My plums were not overly sweet so I added a full cup of sugar.  Served warm with a scoop of French Vanilla ice cream.  Yum!  Great fall dessert and saying goodbye to summer not all that bad :)","1694706257","2"
"127734290","Jane Darrach","Utterly delicious, and so easy!  I used large plums cut into 1/8ths, by the way.","1694710716","2"
"127736858","SimonePDX","Yes, in addition to the batter seeming too dry, the cooking time seemed off to me.","1694716491","2"
"127740644","TraceyT","Good for a change. The batter is a sort of cobbler type rather than a torte (or cake) batter. I used a 9"" springform pan. The THICK batter gets SPOONED into the pan. I cut the plums into fan-like slices and added a few slices of peaches,too (because they were here and fresh). I liked the simplicity and quick prep.  Based on other cooking notes, I checked the pan at 45 minutes, left it in a few minutes longer.  It's a nice addition to the recipe repertoire and amenable to changes.","1694724575","2"

"127779284","Vikki","This was really delightful. I trusted the almost 12,000 5-star reviews, but nearly every step of this recipe seemed wrong to me. In the end, I'm glad I just followed it to fidelity. It was delicious! Like others mentioned - my plums were MUCH bigger - so I only used 5 (10 halves). I used a 9"" springform and it definitely looked like there wouldn't be enough batter, but I spread it out and dropped my plum halves in, skin-side up, as directed. It rose beautifully and mine was ready in 45 minutes.","1694874014","2"
"127787445","JLH","I agree, I wrote a comment that wasn't posted asking that they update the recipe. I understand that this is an older recipe but they are showcasing it again. It shouldn't be difficult to put 120g (1 cup) of flour unless they mean it to be more or less and 4 ounces of butter. Where I live butter doesn't come in ""sticks"" it comes in 8 ounce blocks. It's better to avoid confusion and provide the weights for ingredients.","1694905919","2"
"127799800","karen","I am a genuinely terrible baker. I can make shortbread cookies and banana bread, but that's about it. I just made two of these - one in a Bundt pan (turbinado sugar), one in a regular 9"" round cake pan (plain white sugar). The batter was so thick, I was sure I had messed it up somehow, but they look and smell amazing and I can't wait to compare! Hooray!","1694984470","2"

"127882435","Jaylorraine","I made this recipe using Bob's Red Mill One to One Gluten Free flour mix. I cut back on the sugar to less than 3/4 cup. I used slices of plums (2) on the top of the torte because I was afraid the GF flour batter would get far too soggy using plum halves. The torte took about 40 minutes to bake in a 9-inch round pan. It was perfectly done and really wonderful. I will use more fruit next time as I experiment with the GF version. Two big thumbs up for this recipe!","1695253955","2"
"127885374","JLH","My plums sunk also and I am an experienced baker. I followed the recipe, weighed the flour (1 cup is 120g) and used softened butter. It isn't your failure. I think the recipe uses a ""dipped"" cup of flour which is considerably more than 120g. You might try increasing the flour to 150g and quartering the plums. I baked mine for 45 minutes at a true 350º in a ten inch springform pan. I hope you read this comment and don't feel bad! It was delicious but it was more of a cobbler than a torte.","1695265833","2"

"135991759","Brenda","First of all, every cake tastes better when you make a yeast dough. It is really not that hard and will make a big difference. Put the plums on top of the dough next to each other, no gaps. I also suggest to make crumbles out of butter, flour and sugar(just mix in a bowl with a folk) and top the cake with them. This is the way my mother in law back in Germany used to make it and she learned it from her mother, we are going back to 1880 now...","1725641479","2"
"136003385","Gerry g","Good with any stone fruits, blueberries, apples or pears.  I marinate the fruit for a bit in lemon juice and sugar, then arrange the fruit slices atop the batter and drizzle any leftover liquid over the fruit.  I add a crumb topping (flour, butter, walnuts, cinnamon chopped together in a food processor).    Bake as instructed.  To fancy it up, a sprinkle of confectioners sugar on top just before serving.  My grandkids and everyone else loves, loves, loves!","1725669957","2"
"136019813","Deborah","This is almost exactly the same as my Aunt Bess' plum cake (which I try not to bake because it is so delicious, I can't stop eating it!) The only difference is she used a little less sugar, (1/2 cup) and no lemon juice. She also would add a 1/2 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract or almond extract. It also works well with peaches, nectarines, blueberries and/or peeled apple slices.","1725755994","2"

"136041324","capeMimi","I absolutely adore this recipe and always get groans of delight. I add 1t almond extract and sprinkle the buttered springform pan with turbinado sugar as well as the top. My plums are slivers and form a pinwheel.","1725888522","2"
"136072644","JCS3","More plums is not a bad thing, the dough eats them up. Use the little ones if you can. Adding a dollop or two of tart stiff yoghurt adds a nice flavor and creamy texture to the dough. My German(ish) wife said it brought back memories of her favorite bakery in Lausanne.","1725980829","2"
"136100641","Schroomer","Used mini spring form pans to make 5 with approx 110g batter per greased pan, setting the half plum in the center with a gentle push setting it in the batter. Using 325 convection they cooked in 35 minutes with the batter almost covering the plum. Eaten warm, it was a great breakfast on a cool late summer morning. Made exactly as originally written. And yes, you can go to 3/4 cup sugar in the batter as the sprinkle of sugar on the top provides a nice hit of sweet.","1726066865","2"

"136191541","Name ninazrose","The plum torte has been a favorite for many years at our house. We have several plum trees, including wild ones- they all work. Sometimes I line the bottom with poppy seeds- other times, with fine cornmeal. All good! Happy Plum torte anniversary!!!","1726332088","2"

"136193909","ESTELLE FRIED","This is a wonderful old Eastern European tour and plum season. Another version of this is instead of the plums as it gets into November you could make it with cranberries and apples, which is very pretty color wise also and delicious.","1726337820","2"
"136196405","Janice F","I make this often-no need for a springform pan. Butter and flour an ordinary 9” round cake pan then line the bottom with parchment. Run a butter knife around the sides when it comes out of the oven, cool 5 minutes, then unmold. Never had a problem with sticking. Don’t agonize over weighing the flour-recipe is very forgiving. Use ANY fruit or berry and don’t be skimpy-cover the top of the batter. Cinnamon doesn’t go with fruits, so add 1 1/2 t vanilla to batter, and sprinkle with coarse sugar before baking.","1726347644","2"
"136197309","Olivia","It’s worth the hype. My edit was using mostly King Arthur’s Golden Wheat (formerly known as White Whole Wheat) for the flour with a dash of almond flour. A dash of almond extract, too.","1726353739","2"
"136198117","Deborah","Have been making this recipe for many, many years. Easy, delicious, and very adaptable (to different fruits.) I use use less sugar - 2/3 cup - and it's still great. Also, I read, awhile ago, a reader who said she added fresh chopped rosemary to the batter, So I tried that and it is REALLY delicious. The 1 teaspoon of rosemary adds a lovely, very subtle flavor. No wonder this recipe is the most popular recipe of the NY Times. It's terrific!","1726362406","2"
"136198220","Caterina Colonnese","I like the reviewer's suggestion to use 1/3 cornmeal and 2/3 white flour. Note the plums shrink A LOT so place them closely unless you like a lot of plain cake! Delicious","1726363584","2"
"136198965","Bobbi","This is very close to a recipe my Austrian mother-in-law gave me decades ago that used much less sugar. Separating the eggs and folding the whipped whites in makes for a much lighter, delicate crumb. Also, I think placing the plum halves skin side down and pressing them into the batter until level with the batter, then dusting with sugar makes for a much better presentation.","1726382638","2"
"136200338","sumwug","This cake, or one very like it, was a fall ritual when I was a student in Germany almost 50 years ago. I rejoiced when this recipe came out and when I found a source for the Zwetschgen plums (a local orchard). Still bake it every year, but now I use half  “white” whole wheat flour and add a tiny splash of milk b/c w.w flour requires more hydration. Lots of leeway with this recipe. Its beauty is its simplicity. Some of the notes here bring tears to my eyes.","1726404657","2"
"136203431","penny","My mother made this or near clone when i was a kid, maybe  70 years ago. The Milwaukee Settlement Cookbook had a recipe, the Joy of Cooking had a recipe, and Fanny Farmer had a recipe, all of them almost identical to this. It’s been around forever and if you start looking at old eastern european cookbooks, you’ll likely find a similar recipe","1726412692","2"
"136209180","Johanna","This was really easy with a yummy result. I used an 8 inch springform and would probably go for a larger one in the future, just to get more plums on that dough. It was delicious as it was, but I topped it with some Mascarpone whipped with lemon zest and agave syrup and that made it even more irresistible.","1726430954","2"
"136211079","May","I never thought I would enjoy a plum dessert yet alone a plum torte. But this recipe is amazing! I used 4 red pluots cut into 1/2” slices and fan them out on top of the batter. I added 1 teaspoon almond extract and toss the sliced pluots in a mixture of lemon zest, lemon juice, sugar and cinnamon. Also sprinkle a little sugar on top before baking. I used an 8” springform pan baked in my little toaster oven for an hour.","1726446661","2"
"136211798","sarah","I don't expect anyone to read this, but ""Do It"", make this recipe.  I wouldn't give you a nickel for a plum I could find in basic grocery stores, but I can find a few once in awhile from friends who still have old, wonderful trees which produce Lovely small plums.  ANYway, don't be afraid to make this with other fruit.  I tend to use concentric circles of different berries pushed slightly into the batter.  Yes, use that sprinkling of sugar on top for raspberries or, well, just for any fruit mix.","1726457016","2"
"136294343","Park Slope","I have made this so many times, as did my mother, now of blessed memory.  It is such a forgiving recipe- it always comes out so delicious and toothsome. This time I used a half cup of all purpose flour and a half cup of almond flour and added a half teaspoon of almond extract plus some ginger and cardamom. It was fully cooked after 45 minutes. The plums on top mostly sank into the cake so it wasn’t so beautiful visually but it was moist and absolutely delicious. A fabulous classic recipe!","1726710663","2"
