"16254870","Roseanne L.","I like to use the paper bag method for dusting meat.<br/>Put flour and seasonings and meat, chicken, etc in paper bag, fold closed and shake. One less utensil to clean and even coating.","1509375373","2881"
"20608779","Eric","Tablespoon of herbs de Provence and 2 Tablespoons tomato paste will give it some flavor.","1508887811","2229"
"25283261","Tom","After browning the beef sauté the onions. Then add about 1 to 2 tablespoons of tomato paste and continue to cook until the color starts to go from bright red to rust. Then deglaze with the wine and vinegar. Add one tall spike of fresh rosemary (leaves removed and chopped) and three to four sprigs of thyme. Follow the recipe and finish with two cups of peas two to three minutes before serving.","1513733313","2016"
"30164135","Nancy","Okay People, this is ""Old Fashioned Beef Stew"" and it's exactly how my Mom made it and How I've made it for 45 years.  Flouring your meat before browning actually adds flavor to the stew.  There are tons of beef stew recipe out there, but this is authentic ""Old Fashioned""!","1547563142","833"
"29112874","Linda","If you're complaining about blandness, red wine, a bit of Worcestershire or even some harissa can help liven it up. Also, homemade peasant bread or even some store bought parker house rolls are a wonderful accompaniment.   This is exactly my mother's go-to recipe for beef stew. She's gone now, but I would give anything to eat this with her one more time.","1540241700","753"
"16272018","Lisa Conn","This was delicious.  I cubed a chuck roast which was cheap and flavorful (removing all excess fat).  I added some worchestershire sauce and ketchup at the end to add umami (flavor). After cooking I separated the solids and boiled the liquid a bit to reduce and concentrate, then whisked in a slurry of flour and water to thicken before recombining with meat and veggies.  This stew is a one pot meal.  It doesn't require rice or noodles because of the large amount of potatoes.","1509375790","488"
"30862238","Jack Wilson","I think many of the negative comments were from people who have no idea what an old time stew tasted like. They probably have McDonald's taste buds and there is no changing that. This was a wonderful stew. With that said I also added to it. My choice was worcester sauce from my Brittish background. Adapting a recipe to fit your own taste is a normal procedure. Perhaps if some of these who commented threw in a Quarte pounder they would have felt differently.","1551514066","458"
"29650151","Bill","Julia Childs recommends just browning the meat in oil without flour.  Then make the stew as shown here. She thickens the gravy at the end by adding miller's butter (half butter and half flour) rolled into little balls, one at a time, until it's as thick as you like.  I agree with her.","1544124425","425"
"20011608","Bob davison","Two great Irish cooks rated this the best beef stew they ever tasted.  It's a keeper in our home.","1508886312","419"
"21456999","Marjorie Och","Excellent. Added thyme. Sauteed the chopped onions. Used olive oil. Substituted gold potatoes for the bakers. Added about 1/2 t. Worcestershire sauce and some ketchup...good additions. Should include a beef bone in the cooking.","1508865831","408"
"22397694","Diana","Sautéed onion and a shallot, added to deglazed pot with browned meat and a few sprigs of thyme. Added 2 T tomato paste, more pepper, shot of Worcestershire sauce and peas at the last...as my mother always did. Excellent stew. I will make it again. ","1506866931","333"
"21490195","Patrick","For this stew (and all others I've made), I like to use beef shank - lots more marbling than chuck, and just melts in one's mouth after an hour or so of slow simmering. I also throw the bones in (along with marrow) to add flavor. If you're making a big pot, shank is about half the price of chuck!","1508866413","308"
"21528717","MT","This was delicious, though I made a few alterations. Like others, I added more herbs (thyme, rosemary, herbs de Provence, Basil, ground all spice). I chopped up the onion & along with a few table spoons of oil and tomato paste,I microwaved it with the herbs in a bowl for about 1 minute on high (a trick I learned from Cooks Illustrated slow cooker recipe book) & then I added this mixture to the pot at the start of step 2 above. Cooked the meat much longer, a/b 5 hrs before adding veggies.","1508866048","255"
"30293974","Fast Marty","save money and use beef chuck instead of ribeyes/filets.  get an intact chuck roast from the butcher, not pre-cubed ""beef for stew"".  Cut the meat up yourself into small cubes.  Ribeyes are for grilling, or broiling, not stew.  The collagen breaks down nicely and the chuck meat transforms wonderfully. Of course, if you're wealthy, do as you wish.","1548268097","177"
"21202734","Sheerah","Loved this. Doubled the wine & reduced the beef broth. Sprinkled in Herbes de Provence as per another review's suggestion. I'm normally a high-intensity spice seeker but found this dish flavorful and tender in its classic-ness.","1508858786","145"
"21528520","Mike","Too many recipes call for stew meat, which is often too-lean mystery cut. Chuck or some other fatter cut is much more flavorful and won't end up dry and tasteless. Want to really jazz up a stew? Add rutabaga and a couple of large oxtails (shred before serving).","1508865711","118"
"16308441","Leslie","I sadly didn't love this.  It was relatively straight forward and easy, but I found the taste to be kind of bland, despite using some killer homemade beef broth in my freezer.  There were too many onions for my taste, so I ended up scooping some out before I served it.  I used parsnips instead of potatoes, but other than that, stuck to the recipe. I will try it again and add some thyme, maybe up the red wine, caramelize the onions or roast the veggies in advance to add some depth.","1509376416","116"
"24668230","eat drink and be merry","I used balsamic vinegar instead of red vinegar and used 4 medium side red potatoes( peeled and quartered as recipe stated)and added2 medium size chopped garlic cloves -followed recipe otherwise and am a huge fan- needs 1.5 lbs of meat though. Sopped it up with garlic bread and it's a keeper! Better than ina gartens -which was always my go to stew recipe!","1509502320","116"
"21528854","Stephen Exel","Use this recipe as a starting point for making really delicious beef stew;  by itself it is only mediocre. The method is fine, but as others have mentioned, the dish lacks seasoning and depth. I had leftovers, so I upped the salt and added other flavors: one night, herbes de Provence; another, lots of thyme and black pepper. I added red wine and reheated over low heat to infuse the new flavors. The leftovers were better than the original, so if you make this recipe add your own personal touches.","1508865852","114"
"21440565","maria","I've been making this since it first ran in the Times. It's delicious! For the heck of it, I might take Eric's suggestion and add herbs de Provence and some tomato paste, for depth, but it is very, very nice on its own. A standard.","1508865874","106"
"21630382","Lindsay","This is so delicious! I cooked this as written except I used 2 pounds of beef (fat-marbled chuck roast, cut into cubes), and it lasted our household of 2 a whole work week plus Sunday dinner. I also caramelized the onions and carrots in butter before adding them to the stew to cook. It's basically a pot roast you can eat in a bowl, which is a great work-lunch concept.","1508866740","101"
"21448022","David","You could cook this same recipe in a pressure cooker and it would be done in 20 minutes.  You could then put some dumplings in and cook wth the lid closed for another 5 mins","1508866834","97"
"21447689","S.","Not much chance for flavor development with this bare-bones recipe. Just salt & pepper won't cut it. Desperately needs seasoning (garlic pwdr., onion pwdr., smoked paprika, celery salt, etc.) herbs de provence and caramelization of onions & garlic along with the meat. And that's just for starters! Better yet, just find another recipe.","1508866342","89"
"25644011","jennifer","So I read everyone's notes and just dumped in any/every spice you mentioned...the stew was GREAT!","1516554464","81"
"26376458","Terence","I added a bouquet garnet of thyme, smashed garlic, Italian parsley and the called-for bay leaves. I also added tomato paste and (at the end) some fancy store-bought beef demi-glace.  Finally, I added peas about 2 minutes before taking off heat to serve.  Looked pretty and had lots of flavor.  Oh yeah, I probably used twice the wine and an extra pound of stew meat.  You really cant go wrong with extra wine and meat.  That's just a rule of thumb to live by ;)","1521416118","75"
"30044349","EAllison","Started cooking as written. Then, I some read comments and decided to add 3 tbsp. tomato paste, a swig of balsamic vinegar, 1 tsp. each of fresh thyme and rosemary & 3 cloves of chopped garlic. Sauteed the onions and garlic until softened & slightly caramelized. Then I tossed the carrots into the saute pan for a few mins before adding to the stew. Did the same with the potatoes. Kept the lid off for 15 mins at the end of simmering and it thickened up nicely. Lovely flavor -- will make again!","1546920578","64"
"101031180","DB","I was very saddened to read today of Ms. Molly O'Neills passing from liver cancer.  This recipe, along with so many others she concocted herself and many others she wrote down to share with us her readers -- is a classic and now a family favorite.  One can tweak and add to this basic stew in many ways, but the end product, produced of patience, is incredibly satisfying and delicious.","1560959108","63"
"30036547","carmelina","salt pepper and flour in a ziplock bag...shack with meat for easy coverage. of course, everybody knows...","1546890157","41"
"14831988","William Zars","This turns out like grandma's stew. Delicious.","1509367889","39"
"21535175","brevian","Followed recipe and times as written. Except, based on others' comments, toasted about 1Tbsp ea of tomato and anchovy paste, plus 1/2 Tbsp Herbes de Provence in pot before deglazing.  Used a Yukon Gold potato, not ""baking potato"" (Russet). Also added about 1c frozen peas to finished stew and let sit for about 5 minutes to cook peas before serving.  Needed a heavy pinch of salt (broth was low sodium).  Lots of good beefy flavour, tooth firm but cooked veggies. Lovely! Will do again","1508866734","38"
"30125065","Wilva, Hamilton, On.","Used strip loin. Sauteed 5 garlic cloves, 1 onion, 2 stalks celery first. Then the meat. Then the stock, tomato paste. Simmered for 2 hours. Next day I pre-cooked carrots, and baby potatoes and then added to the stew with mushrooms.This was key, as the veggies didn't end up mushy. Gave it to my neighbour who just fractured her kneecap and is on crutches. She RAVED about it. Actually, it was the BEST stew I have ever made. ","1547330344","37"
"25611982","Joyce Miller","With the exception of the red wine vinegar, red wine, and bay leaves, this recipe is identical to that my grandmother made and called old fashion beef stew - beef, potatoes, and carrots in a thickened broth. I'm different from most folks as I like to taste the pure flavors of the main ingredients in a dish. In my mind, when you add all the extra things added by others, it is no longer old fashion beef stew but something akin to Le Boeuf and Vegetables ala Herbs de Provence. Cooking it now.","1516311853","36"
"100242575","scj","For really tender stew meat, you need big thick chuck roasts cut(trimming to remove sinews and silver skin) into 2""X 2"" inch cubes, or close to it.  Cutting against or across the grain.  Never buy any meat labeled stew meat in a grocery store.  Do not brown.  Put meat in a heavy enameled cast iron pot into a 250-300 degree oven for 3-4 hours. Stir half way thru. Browning one inch chunks turns the meat into shoe leather.","1556588906","34"
"29697330","Andrea","Recipe is a keeper! It really nailed that “I feel like beef stew” craving on a cold night. Used it several times and will keep on. Simple to make, which I appreciate. The flavor is rich and very satisfying. I get the beef stock from a local butcher along with the cubed meat. I use sweet potatoes in place of regular. Adds a suntle sweetness.*Sidenote I like to choose a red wine I can sip on since it needs a cup. Some for the recipe and the rest for the chef ;)","1544490768","31"
"30356156","Judy","Regardless of how much money you have to spend, chuck provides a tastier stew than either rib eye or filet. In a package of ""stew meat"" it's usually the major component. Fifty years ago, the average good cook knew all the cuts and what type of cooking would bring out the best in each. Sadly, that no longer seems to be true.","1548617403","30"
"28920556","Yogamom","Almost identical to my Grandmother's recipe. She was Irish-born, but moved to England during WWII to make money to send back home. She worked and trained under French chefs at a hotel in Manchester. She was an amazing cook and drew from this French influence; she added more red wine (obviously), garlic, and thyme. (When she was at the hotel as a young lady, she met Princesses Elizabeth & Anne, Vivian Leigh and Leslie Howard; it was considered a safe hotel that Hitler would not bomb.)","1538849902","29"
"30590300","DrDre2008","This may well be the best stew I've ever made! I followed this one only loosely, amplifying flavor and texture significant. I used 1.5# of beef. I subbed marsala for red wine, adding a bit more in place of vinegar. To deepen flavor, I tied together a bunch of fresh herbs--thyme, sage, rosemary, Italian parsley--and included them in the simmer state. I added celery with carrots and potatoes. A.MAY.ZING.","1550005212","27"
"30071895","Mary White","Why crest unnecessary plastic waste?","1547045620","26"
"30987659","Ben","I thought this was delicious in its simplicity. In hindsight, I might have caramelized the onions, added a dab of tomato paste and perhaps cooked the meat a bit longer. But I did not miss all the herbs and spices that other folks are recommending. And I was very happy with what came out of the pot as it was.","1552234894","26"
"30878173","Judy","I agree that the tomato paste and herbs de Provence made a more deeply flavored stew.  I have cooked it both ways but adding those two ingredients bumped the flavor profile way up.","1551644705","24"
"24609088","Madalyn","This recipe turned out delicious although I do think it is incomplete. I used 2lbs beef, doubling the flour as well, including 1 1/2tsp salt at that stage. I added about 50% more of other ingredients including beef stock, wine, vinegar, carrots and potatoes. I added the vegetables early, after only 1 hour of simmering the beef, I might have had the simmer a little too high. I also added 1tsp each of thyme, basil and parsely (dried). Will definitely make this again.","1509061066","23"
"30672765","sharinyc","This was a huge hit across the board with my family.   Looking at the previous notes, I added shallots and herbs de Provence and tomato paste.  I also sautéed the onions and shallots immediately after removing the beef and sautéed until they glistened (added 1 tbsp of butter for the sauté) then added the vinegar, wine and tomato paste to deglaze the pot.  I also simmered it for a total of 2 1/2 hours before serving.  Highly recommend.","1550441071","22"
"21444742","Catherine","The stew is better with some rutabaga--it adds a fuller flavor.  Parsnips and mushrooms are also good.  You could replace one or two of the carrots in this recipe with parsnips.  A little rutabaga goes a long way--I usually add one or at most two slices (about half-inch thick), chopped into smaller bite-sized pieces.","1508865640","21"
"29884471","Bristol96","If made as exactly as written, this is more of a soup then a stew.  The onions would have been been suited browned and not added with the vegetables.  If you want a stew plan to thicken it with corn starch.  ","1545693095","21"
"100077813","Robert","Very GOOD, i though added 3 1/2 lbs of meat. Who are we kidding, we all want more meat.","1555637797","21"
"104313278","C.  Pierson","Took almost EVERYONE'S suggestions...shook the meat in a bag w/the flour & pepper, sauteed the onions and added 2 T tomato paste, added rosemary, herbes de Provence, at the end, added peas and worstershire sauce. Tasted great and was a big hit on Christmas Eve!","1577295484","20"
"109889534","Janet","Most supermarket meat is wet and steams when you try to brown it. Salt it and set it on a rack in a sheet pan. Refrigerate it overnight or even for two nights. Bring it to room temp and blot it with paper towels before you brown it. You'll be amazed at how much more flavor your stew will have.","1604072701","17"
"21528232","Jackson Fairley","My beef stew includes rosemary and sage, two easy to grow herbs in any climate. Also, four or five stalks of celery, a large can of organic tomatoes (they really do taste better),  and most of the time, a bunch of Swiss Chard, or spinach, which just melts into the stew. I have found  that I like red potatoes better than bakers in the stew. Cooking the beef for an hour first makes all the difference because it just falls apart. Then the beef stew is perfect for this house.","1508866041","16"
"25606435","Adjustments","X1.5 for leftovers   -After removing meat from pan, sauté onions until translucent, sauté garlic. Deglaze -Deglaze with a little less wine and more vinegar. Add 2T of tomato paste -Simmer with fresh thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf -Add celery when adding carrots (also I used a little less potatoes and more veggies) -Salt and pepper to taste","1516295246","15"

"29893829","Sherry Gilliland","Pressure cook on stovetop 10 min with 1 c barley, 3# seared seasoned meat in double the liquids & bay leaves. Use as expensive a red wine as you can allow yourself. I used Robert Mondavi Cabernet Sauvignon aged in bourbon barrels for under $13 with delicious results. Add 2T tomato paste. Another 3 minutes with the potatoes and mushrooms Another 2 minutes with carrots, squashes, spinach, and onions with spices, garlic, Italian seasonings. Add sauteed onions, frozen peas if desired when done","1545781039","15"

"30614698","Candace","How much thyme, sage, rosemary and parsley?  Thank you","1550158540","15"
"30015934","Janet","A good recipe. I add more root veggies to it like diced parsnips and/or rutabagas and instead of cooking on the range, I bake at 350 for an hour or so.  Less of a chance of burning. ","1546736176","14"
"30238865","Judy","Flouring the meat before browning thickens the stew; it also adds flavor. So does making the stew a day in advance of serving. We like our stew vegetables soft enough to mash slightly into the gravy, so I put carrots and potatoes in together and cook for an hour when beef is almost tender. If using pasture-raised beef, cooking time may be longer but the flavor is worth the wait. This is an excellent recipe, basically the stew I was raised on.","1547921315","14"
"28920225","Teddy","Don't use ""stewing beef"".  It is a combination of different cuts of different sizes, the left- overs after the steaks and roasts have been trimmed.  I suggest buying a small roast or steak, like bottom round and cut it yourself into uniformly sized pieces. You know what you're getting and the price is the same.  Different cuts cook at different speeds and have different flavors.","1538839731","13"
"29759968","Ariel","Remember, other beginner chefs - stew takes a minute to come together! It's more delicious the next day. I more-or-less tripled this and it was spectacular and kept getting better throughout the week.","1544888862","13"
"29933225","Ken McBroom","Awesome recipe. I like to add a dark beer to my stew and a lot of black pepper. It’s how my grandfather did it so might be acquired taste but it taste great with this recipe. Thanks","1546116449","13"
"30255271","KT","I have made this with the add-ons suggested (more broth, tomato paste, Worcestershire, thyme) and straight on. Both are wonderful. To get the vegetables to desired softness and stew to desired thickness, I extend cooking time by one hour on lowest possible simmer (covered dutch oven open just a crack). Do add carrots first and then potato a little later (if you like your potato tender but not melty). I find a whole onion is a lot and half is perfect. Liberally salt and pepper during last hour.","1548040607","13"
"28920330","Shawnee","Made this for a group of friends. The women definitely enjoyed it, but the men acted as if they’d died and gone to heaven! LOL  This in amazing stew with a strong beefy flavor.  Not to mention, it’s even more tender and flavorful the next day.   My tweaks:  Left the peelings on the potatoes and carrots and added garlic and celery.  Served with a pan of sweet cornbread.","1538842637","12"
"28824635","Sarah","Browned 3 # meat dredged with flour, pepper, paprika. Set aside. Deglazed pan with 6T red wine vinegar and poured it over the set aside meat. Then wilted 2 chopped onions and spices (1 T oregano, 1 tsp thyme, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, paprika, 3 bay leaves) in oil in the pan, then added 4 cups beef stock and 2 1/2 c Shiraz wine. Brought to a boil then added back the meat and drippings. Cooked for the 1 1/2 hours then added potatoes, carrots, and red top turnips. Salt to taste. Tastes great. Try it!","1538328533","11"
"29830789","Faye","I agree with those who found this a little bland. Mine was also not thick at all, more like soup broth. I ended up making e a roux at the end to thicken, and stirring in some caramelized onion from a jar to try to liven it up. I don't think I'd make it again, but if I did I would saute onion first, and add garlic as some suggested.","1545343187","11"
"30254257","Katherine","Excellent meal.  Cooked  and measured exactly.  Family loved it.  Will make again and make with 50% more meat.  I also floured the beef in a Ziploc.  Cuts down on the mess.  ","1548028168","11"
"25373829","Cameron","Incredible flavor. Followed the recipe to the letter and the meat was extraordinarily tender. My only issue was that the broth was a bit too thin at the end of the cooking, so I thickened it with a slurry of seasoned flour and stock. That did the trick. I’ll definitely be adding this to my regular rotation. ","1514593511","10"
"26533173","Susan Rutberg","I love this recipe ad agree it can use a flavor boost. I added a few cloves, several sprigs of thyme, and extra salt. I substituted red pearl onions and small red potatoes. At the end, I added mushrooms sautéed in butter and a handful of green peas. Such a satisfying one bowl meal!","1522351645","10"
"29773451","Michele cloutier","I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar. Mmmm","1545047806","10"
"30602005","Judy","Almost any stew can be adapted to the slow cooker. I find it best to brown the meat first, then put everything together in the pot--but you don't really have to. Vegetables can cook the same amount of time as the meat. You may want to reduce liquid; there will be little to no evaporation. If you don't flour and brown the meat first, you may want to thicken the stew at the end. A flour & water or cornstarch & water slurry will do the trick--stir in and cook 1/2 hour longer.","1550083238","10"
"30699061","MB","Made it for tonight’s dinner.  Followed as is and it turned out awesome.  Great depth of flavor and really quick and easy one pot meal.  I will make this again.","1550614651","10"
"110878441","Mark","My Mom was old school at cooking meals. Having grown up during the depression era, she learned from her Mom how to make basic but filling meals without a lot of flare. This recipe reminds me of how she used to make it. Basic but comforting to come home from school to. We didn’t use lots of spices. Just good old salt and pepper. While there’s nothing wrong with adjusting to your taste, there’s no need to be negative. This is a basic recipe. Nothing fancy, just good old fashioned stew.","1609764555","10"
"128103701","Richard","This is ""old-fashioned"" stew, not a new-fangled stew with exotic spices. If you use good beef and high quality carrots and potatoes, you won't need a dozen spices. If the beef is properly floured at the beginning, the stew won't be watery.   Just bay leaf. Seriously!","1696068805","10"
"21024845","NSClarke","this is really good - some people didn't think it had enough flavor, but we thought it was delicious. Made according to recipe","1508857585","9"
"30011744","Virginia","The best stew recipe ever!! I used 3 pounds of meat instead of the one pound the recipe says. I’m a tolerably good cook and have not been able to make stew that tastes this good. Thank you! ","1546711108","9"
"30239206","Rosie F","My go-to for beef stew. I don't cool with wine, so I skipped that. I deglazed the pot with the vinegar and some broth instead. I added a couple tablespoons of tomato paste, some thyme and a couple tablespoons of Worcestershire. I also cooked vegetables longer than suggested. Delicious!","1547926454","9"
"100211187","ejc","Very good simple stew recipe. It converts well for quick cooking in the instant pot. 35 minutes for the meat and naturally release the pressure, then 6 minutes for the veg.","1556381116","9"
"109484343","Nancy M.","I cook this in a hollowed out pumpkin (after browning the meat, and deglazing the pan).  I cut the amount of potatoes in half so that I can scoop some of the pumpkin up with the stew as a starch.  It is always impressive when you take a pumpkin out of the oven, open the lid, then start serving from it!  Be sure to place the pumpkin in a deep baking pan in case you scrape the bottom layer too thin when hollowing the gourd and get a little leakage. This also keeps the pumpkin stable.  Enjoy!","1601929065","9"
"109612200","Geoff","This is a fabulous recipe. Truly. Probably the best beef stew I’ve made. Only one cheat: Trader Joe’s umami seasoning at the end for a little extra (complementary!) flavor.   Thank you, NYT Cooking, for making my life a little better everyday.","1602632139","9"
"25258995","HAT","I don’t have 2.5 hours so I used the pressure cooker. Worked out amazing. I also don’t cook with red wine so I used white. I also threw in three jalapeños and one minced garlic clove. After browning the meat and sautéing the vegetables and garlic, I pressure cooked everything for 15 mins. Everyone gobbled it up. Highly recommend the pressure cooker for this dish. ","1513547024","8"
"25427541","George","When I want the timeless comfort of meat-n-potatoes, this is it. Bay leaf is a miracle, let it do its thing.

Another 3 minutes with the potatoes and mushrooms   Another 2 minutes with carrots, squashes, spinach, and onions with spices, garlic, Italian seasonings. Add sauteed onions, frozen peas if desired when done","1545777964","2"

"30672363","Jean","Store-bought, pre-cut stew beef lacks fat, which adds flavor. Perhaps that’s why some readers complained of blandness. I wonder if a dollop of olive oil could replace fat, since I already bought it. I realized the problem only after reading comments.","1550436877","2"
"30675437","Theresa","Fabulous stew taking me back many years to my childhood.   My mom made this regularly,  and the taste was almost right on the money.   I read the reviews and also added some thyme and sage, and a bit of lawrys seasoning salt, and the result was fantastic !","1550483276","2"
"30684200","Jen","I didn't have red wine, but I had some stout, so I used that instead. And following a few people's comments, I also added a little tomato paste. Classic, simple, perfect for a rainy day!","1550534728","2"
"30774465","James Talmadge","I took this recipe as a base and put my own spin on it by altering the following:  - Sauteed the onions and added a shallot prior to browning the beef (same pot) -added 3 parsnips (made a double batch) -added a bunch of kale - substituted the russet for red potatoes  So, in essence, taking someone else's recipe and adding a few things to ""make it your own"". Came out extremely tasty and great to throw in the freezer for easy lunches and dinners during the work week. Thanks for the recipe!","1551030460","2"

We didn't have any beef broth in the pantry so I subbed it out with vegetable stock and seasoned it with some fennel, basil, seasoned salt, and rosemary. I also browned the beef in some bacon fat in a separate pan before adding it to the stew to simmer and it turned out fabulously.","1553301364","2"

"101458124","Nonnie H.","The Stew was definitely not dry in fact I ended up making a roux out of the small amount of flour mixture I had left, stirred in with the veggies, and left uncovered while they cooked, hoping for a thicker gravy--- it did help a bit.  Flavor was delicious","1563154181","2"
"104582985","Jessica","I made this today. It is very easy and very tasty, but a little bland. I served it with a fresh-baked french bread loaf. Next time, I will saute onion and sliced mushrooms after browning the meat so it adds an umami flavor to the sauce, add celery with the carrots, and add more salt to every layer.","1578803903","2"

"109888910","Kathleen Cahill","I made stew last Monday. I started with 5.66 lbs of stew meat, so of course all other ingredients were bumped up. I added dried porcini mushrooms, 1 lb of white mushrooms, browned, 2T Herbs de Provence as others have mentioned, and a bouquet garni of several twigs of thyme and 2 rosemary. I also used a full bodied ale instead of wine. The stew was a spiritual experience, so good. Served over noodles, with a slice of homemade Rosemary bread. I have enough to freeze for later in the cold weather.","1604071090","2"

"109889511","Theresa Maier","I did listen to comments especially the witty  PDeCo.  My recent ""discovery"" is the beautiful white turnip, which I add instead of potato.  With that substitution, the stew freezes nicely.  Because turnip is such a hard root vegetable, I add in quartered chunks 1/2 hour after the meat begins to simmer. Two cups of cubed butternut squash added along with the onions and carrot dissolves into the stew for a sweetened and thickened touch.  Finally, I have learned NOT to overcook my stew.","1604072646","2"

"120474887","pekio meow","Used this recipe as a starting point for proportions and blended it with my favorite techniques from Julia Child’s beef bourguignon, cooking up lardons, browning the beef in the fat and doing a brandy deglaze followed by removing the beef to a plate, adding in some tomato paste, balsamic, Worcestershire and red wine for a second deglaze before adding back the beef and topping with wine, stock, water and bay leaves. Added salt and put in the oven for almost 2 hours then added in veg as directed.","1663527422","2"

"125414462","Michael Miller","A suggestion: dice the meat into small cubes, maybe about the size of sugar cubes. It's more work but it helps the meat last longer than a few large chunks. Maybe I'm projecting - as a kid, I always picked out the meat from the stew first.","1685470466","2"

"128309989","Diane","This is pretty much how I make stew, all my now long life. I learned this from my mother, and she from her mother. The only thing I do differently, is to sauté the onions, plus garlic, in the beginning. They cook to almost nothing, and add so much flavor. I also add Herbs de Provence, which my mother never did. Winter comfort food.","1696778398","2"

Basically a stew should be free reign to add what you like. In Staffordshire UK they call a stew ‘Lobby’. That’s because you lobbed in the pot whatever you had in stock!","1696785987","2"
"128314533","Linda","two adaptations from me: I add 1c of coffee to the deglazing mix  It adds to rich brown color. Use the german sauerbraten method to thicken the gravy.. Finely crush 6-8 gingersnaps and mix with a small amount of water. Add gradualy, and stir in,  will thicken as it simmers. Repeat if not  thick to your taste","1696792371","2"
"128316013","jk","For those complaining about blandness, not everything is supposed to be like Thai food. This is comfort food and it's supposed to feel good around your tongue and down your throat. It's not bland it's just that it's not highly spicy. Don't go but leave it in your mouth for a few seconds to taste the different mold flavors of the potatoes carrots meat. You will find it's not as bland as you think.","1696798899","2"

"129597907","Robin from Tumwater WA","Second time making.  Used Costco Beef for Stew (already cut up, and easy to portion out the weight needed).  Used Better Than Bouillon Roasted Beef Base for the broth.  No red wine, so used the broth instead.  Mistakenly used Balsamic Vinegar vs. red wine vinegar.  Very happy with results. Made for a delicious fond, along with some broth to deglaze the pan. Added some celery, as I had some fresh in the fridge.  Looking forward to making this again.","1701897817","2"
