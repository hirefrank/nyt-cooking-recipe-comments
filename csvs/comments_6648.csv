"18890211","Betsy Rich","My Dutch baby did not pouf the first time I made it.  Then I remembered that successful Yorkshire pudding requires room temperature ingredients.  So my 2nd Dutch Baby was made with ingredients at room temperature and- poof- I got plenty of pouf, even at altitude in the mountains of Colorado.","1508877252","2554"
"18316019","KW","Banana Baby!  Have a surplus of bananas, so sliced 4 into the hot butter (used an extra T of butter), sprinkled on about 2T turbinado sugar, left sugar out of the batter.  Puffed up gorgeous, done in 18 minutes.   Served with brandied cranberries left over from holidays to offset sweet bananas.  Happy breakfast! Gets a rare 5 stars from here.","1508873727","1387"
"22170385","dutchroo","For my 12 cast iron skillet, this didn't make enough. I've adjusted the amounts as follows:<br/>4 eggs<br/>3/4 cup flour<br/>3/4 cup milk<br/>1 1/2 tbsp sugar<br/>... and the rest I kept the same.","1506865587","1357"
"18675003","Helen","A German pancake is a regular easy main for dinner for my spouse and me. My recipe has no sugar and two eggs; adding a third egg as in this recipe gives it more poof and a bit more custard. Mixing with a whisk is easier than using a blender that requires a scrape or two to incorporate all the flour. We find the pancake comes out of the pan more easily if it's rested for a couple of minutes after it comes out of the oven: it shrinks away from the pan and doesn't collapse.","1508875155","1153"
"18454722","Mar","I put some apple slices with sugar and cinnamon with the butter until the apples are golden brown and then I add the batter. Then to the oven.<br/>Pure heaven.","1508875277","1041"
"19327552","Lynnie","Whoops, added blueberries to melted butter, then added batter.  Blueberries swam to the edge of the pan, and as it started to rise, blueberries started jumping overboard onto the floor of the oven.  All of those sad little burnt blueberries - I'm sure I will remember them for months.  Every time I turn the over on.","1508880282","825"
"24074697","Michael Hamilton","*Ingredients at room temperature.<br/>*Heat the skillet, add the butter, let it melt, then add the batter.<br/>*Use three eggs, 2½ tbls of butter.<br/>*Only add sugar AFTER cooking.<br/>*¼ tsp cinnamon and vanilla added to batter.<br/>*The classic topping is lemon and powdered sugar.<br/>*Whisk by hand all ingredients except the milk, until smooth, and then whisk while slowly adding the milk. More puff.<br/>*Bread flour better for puffiness.<br/>*I cook 20 minutes at 425 degrees, shut off the oven and let it sit 5 minutes.","1508764322","612"
"18465585","Jim","Out west we sometimes prefer a breakfast bread without sugar. Skip the sugar and add some diced jalapenos or green chili and at the end add some grated cheese. Super both ways","1508875246","611"
"18518850","LarryPDX","I used to make these allot, but weren't as puffy as the one's at the ""original: original pancake house , here in Portland, UNTIL I found a recipe that said to use BREAD flour.  That recipe used 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla & cinnamon instead of nutmeg & sugar.  Lemon & powder sugar for topping.<br/><br/>Oh, it also pre-heated skillet, tilt pan to coat pan with butter, then add batter all at once and return to oven. for 15 to 20 min, until puffed and golden brown.","1508875488","493"
"19758730","Julie","It's super important to have room temperature ingredients to get that poof. Added some vanilla extract to the batter and ate it with warmed cinnamon apple slices and maple syrup. Only half the butter is necessary, 4 tbsps is overkill. It's delicious and comes together in no time at all, will definitely be repeating this.","1508884133","421"
"23911908","Nancy","The butter would melt, per these instructions, way before the skillet heated properly. Heat the skillet, THEN add the butter, let it melt, then add the batter.","1506885745","375"
"18671820","Jan","This is similar to my Swedish grandmother's savory recipe: Sauté 4 or 5 slices of chopped bacon until crisp. Arrange in 8X8 baking pan with some of the fat spread around to coat the bottom. Place in 425 oven. Combine 1 1/2  c milk, 3/4 c flour, 4 eggs, pinch of salt in blender. Process til well combined. Pour over hot bacon and return to oven til puffed and brown, about 30 min. Great with lingonberries. Cranberry sauce is also good; kids may prefer applesauce.","1508874987","264"
"16934695","Jill -","Made with unsweetened coconut milk, Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free 1:1 Baking Flour, Smart Balance and a tsp of vanilla extract.  Easy recipe and tasty.","1509378644","235"
"19575592","Pete","Since my waffle iron died this has become the go-to Sunday brunch for my wife and I. My only change to date is a little shot of Sonoma Syrup's vanilla crush. Using bread or high gluten flour seems to give better results also. The last five minutes at 300 degrees seemed a waste of effort - my oven barely drops 10 degrees in 5 minutes. I cook 20 minutes at 425 degrees, shut off the oven and let it sit 5 minutes while I set the table. Perfect every time.","1508882880","231"
"18683737","weelittlebird","A+<br/>Used stoneware pie plate. Worked beautifully. Put pie plate in cold oven with butter until hit 425 & butter slightly sizzling.<br/>Poured in batter.<br/>Baked at 425 for 18min then turned oven off & let it sit in there another 6min! (Turned off oven when getting very brown on the top edge & didn't want it to burn.)<br/>Served with maple syrup & powdered sugar.<br/>Oven pancakes have such great flavor & texture bc of the high egg/low flour ratio. Much preffer to griddled pancakes.","1508875866","200"
"17592618","Adriana","I have made these twice, with stellar results.  Sprinkled with confectioners sugar, topped with sliced berries or mixed fruit and drizzled with syrup and topped with whipped cream makes for a Wow! Breakfaster.  And it is so much easier than regular pancakes.  (I made them with regular All Purpose flour once and with fluten free flour the other time and both were superb.)","1508870596","165"
"18465857","GladBlu","Can this recipe be doubled and use a 14"" cast iron skillet?","1508876239","164"
"17823393","Meredith","Excellent with a bit of citrus zest, or if one leaves out the sugar, cooked in tallow or lard and served with a roast instead.","1508871486","154"
"18465213","Linda Law","This is really an English Yorkshire pudding made with an extra egg.  It's traditionally eaten with roast beef but everyone who eats the leftovers in the UK knows how good it is with jam on it too!","1508875156","145"
"18470710","MFF","I've made this for years -- and drizzle  a lemon sauce (fresh lemon combined with confectioners sugar)  over the pancake as soon as it comes out of the oven.","1508875084","140"
"18467280","Patricia","I have this. For more. Than 30 years from an recipe in Sunset Magazine with slightly different proportions:  for each egg use 1/4 c milk and 2 T melted butter.  Always used the 3-egg recipe.  Sometimes used apples as described here but in summer added blueberries after adding batter to the pan.  A big family favorite -- one of sons would make  an entire one for himself on school holidays (at age 8 I would hear him in the kitchen).","1508875030","131"
"18822958","mj","Another terrifically easy, very fungible recipe. I've made it sweet and savory. Much like a pizza you can add nearly anything to make a quick meal. I've tried asparagus and capers, mushrooms and Parmesan, lemon and sugar... nearly anything you can dream up can be added for a quick meal.","1508877950","117"
"18692769","Pete","Just finished eating this- best one I've made. I new Ms. Fabricant was a respected food writer so I trusted her recipe. Made it EXACTLY per the recipe and it was fabulous. The only change I made was that I only have a 9"" cast iron skillet, not a 10"", but it doesn't seem to have made much difference. I would recommend blending a full minute on low, scraping down, and blending 15 - 20 seconds on high before pouring into hot pan. Definitely goes in the ""Winners"" file.","1508875045","108"
"18466110","Sue Llewellyn","Delicious as this is, Meredith below was on the right (savory) track--because what we have here is a ""kissing cousin"" of Yorkshire pudding and/or popovers. And like them, sweet or savory, the recipe can easily be adapted to a muffin tin for individual servings.","1508875626","94"
"14286652","Mary","This is a real hit with guests in the morning! High drama breakfast - it is stunning. Delicious with cultured cream and rhubarb jam.","1509367252","89"
"24003435","Susan Anderson","I would most certainly edit this recipe.<br/>""Cut into wedges"" after cooking as suggested,  and then proceed to eat every single one.<br/>This requires a minimum amount of self control.<br/>I couldn't imagine wrapping the other wedges in foil and saving them for ""later"".<br/>Whenever that might be.","1508765073","74"
"24088136","Caroline","I wish NYT gave weight measurements or let you convert to them, but since I've looked them up for this recipe I'll post them here:<br/><br/>1/2 cup flour is 60 grams<br/>1/2 cup milk is 122.5 grams<br/>1 Tbsp. sugar is 12.5 grams<br/>4 Tbsp. butter is about 57 grams (14.18 per) though I just use as much as needed, which is far less than called for.","1508764529","69"
"17315155","AC","Fantastic & simple. Keep an eye on the baking, I trimmed 5 minutes off. Use salted butter for a delicious flavor.","1508868067","61"
"20261610","When I make Dutch baby pancake's I use two or 3 6 inch cast iron skillets and serve a whole pancake to each person","Try sauté some sliced apples, 2 tablespoons of brown sugar, 2tbsp butter and about quarter cup of rum in a cast iron skillet and sauté over low heat until the apples are tender and serve that over your pancake, absolutely delicious. Go the extra step and flambé the rum.","1508886395","61"
"18598578","Paul Thompson","It made a wonderful breakfast and cooked in 20 minutes total in a cast iron pan. I dressed it with fruit and triple sec and then maple syrup. Decadently delicious. I used cinnamon because I couldn't find the nutmeg. Fine. I found the quantity just right for two--and we're not big eaters. Five stars Florence!","1508876405","58"
"22673714","Constance","So, let me be clear... I am a terrible cook.  This summer I vow to improve with NYTimes Cooking as my muse.  I made this for Mother's Day as a surprise for my saintly elderly mother.  Behold, it was glorious!<br/> I couldn't mess it up!  It was sooo easy, and I served it with jams and whipped cream, and fruit as toppings.  Everyone loved it! If you knew how terrible I am in the kitchen you would understand this was nothing short of a Mother's Day Miracle.  DUTCH BABY WIN!!!","1506869615","56"
"30646886","prufrock","We made these in my restaurant for several years, and used a very similar recipe. What was different was that we started with a small, hot iron skillet and put that on a burner, adding butter, brown sugar, cinnamon and apple slices. We didn't go so far as to clarify the apples, and poured the batter in the pan and popped that into a 500º oven.  Enormously popular!","1550261856","53"
"22198702","CDM","This is the best version of this I've tried as a basic Dutch Baby recipe. I do add a few pinches of salt. It puffs up reliably every time. The classic topping is lemon and powdered sugar. <br/><br/>Omit the nutmeg and add pepper, then cook in muffin tins and you have perfect Yorkshire Puddings--or at least ones like my ex Mother in law in Wiltshire use to make. I spent decades and several  oven fires trying to make those damn things and finally did it by adapting this recipe.","1506866025","52"
"21023932","John Polanin","The only thing I would have clarified in the original recipe text is when to take the pan out of the oven and add the batter. I'm very new to cooking and baking so I followed the instructions literally, which say to remove the pan ""as soon as the butter has melted."" The pan and butter were not nearly hot enough. It should say ""once the butter is sizzling, but before it is browned."" Other than that, it's an amazing, easy recipe.","1508857970","51"
"27734927","Beverly A.","Other Reviewers' Notes  For lots of poof: -All ingredients MUST be at room temp -Whisk by hand all ingredients except the milk, until smooth;   continue to whisk and slowly add milk - I found a different recipe that said to use BREAD flour--much puffier results  Other notes -Only half the butter is necessary, 4 tbsps is overkill -Add recipe's sugar to pan w/butter, then add any fruit (banana, apples, peaches, blueberries); cook, then add batter & continue recipe","1530732891","50"
"22496977","Rick","This is also a terrific breakfast to make as a guest when you overnight at someone else's home.  Just pack the dry ingredients in a Ziploc bag; they'll almost surely have some butter and some milk on hand.  It's always a crap shoot with my friends if they have a decent cast iron skillet (my go-to for Dutch Baby) so I have been known to bring my own just in case.  And a jar of really good preserves.  But talk about appreciative hosts!","1506867952","42"
"31198978","Jenn Lopez","Don’t use 4 tablespoons of butter, which this recipe calls for. I’ve tried this recipe with and without the full 4 tablespoons of butter. If you use 4 tablespoons, you’re Dutch Baby will be flat; It’s too heavy. Just use enough butter to coat the bottom of your 10” cast iron skillet (~1 tablespoon melted on the stovetop) and you will have a fluffy Dutch Baby.","1553362917","42"
"18473358","Judy","Yes. Start with the basics: 1 egg to 1/4 cup each, flour and milk, then 2 tablespoon butter. May add an extra egg to the basic recipe as the one does.","1508875526","39"
"19489181","3weirs","It was delicious. But I'd like to point out that while making it, I noticed that with only a few variances, it's our Yorkshire Pudding recipe! Not that that's a problem.  The difference between this and Yorkshire is butter instead of beef fat, a little less milk and add a breakfast topping!  If you add sausage links to it, its called Toad in the hole in England.<br/><br/>I think to keep it Breakfast related it should have some Apples or Pears baked into it.","1508883052","38"
"25157296","CBP","As an experienced Yorkshire pudding maker...ALL ingredients should be at room temperature, and don't open the oven door until it is done.   I can still hear my grandmother (whose Yorkshires always puffed up higher than anyone else's) yelling as she opened the oven door: ""Wahoo...it's another oven buster.""   I think it was her cigarette ash that always fell into the batter as she whipped it by hand with a wooden spoon.","1512768218","38"
"100214487","""It's a Yorkshire pud""","You do all realise this is a Yorkshire pudding recipe with sugar in it? Remove the sugar and nutmeg, add a bit of salt, and use lard or goose fat instead of butter. Use one of those cupcake baking trays, with a good tablespoon of your fat in each and place in the oven. Once the fat has melted and come up to temp. fill with the batter. It's gotta sizzle. Then pop back in the oven to cook. Serve with roast chicken or beef, all the standard Sunday roast veggies, and thick stock gravy. Perfect.","1556413060","38"
"21542324","JudiAU","You used sprouted spelt flour and mixed it in a food processor and you want to know what you did wrong?","1508866760","35"
"21685463","Nancy","Oops, definitely don't attempt to sub the all purpose flour with whole wheat; not nearly as fluffy. Not all things need to be too healthy :P","1507131379","35"
"24958750","Katherine","For one -1/4 cup each milk and flour mixed with 1 egg - poured over 1/4 stick butter melted in 8 in cast iron pan  For hungry one or two - 1/2 cup each milk and flour mixed with 2 eggs - poured over 1/2 stick butter melted in 10 - 12 in cast iron pan   For hungry 2 or three - 3/4 cup each milk and flour mixed with 3 eggs - poured over 3/4 stick butter melted in 12-14 in cast iron pan.  ","1511629975","34"
"29587871","Anma Ingeana","The key to puffy babies is to have all ingredients at room temperature to start and make the batter the night before, refrigerate. When you get up in the morning take the batter out of the refrigerator and let come to room temperature again. Beat the batter until light and foamy.  Then follow recipe. I do like my oven at 400 not 425.  Once I tried making the recipe in the morning and the results were dramatically less puffy.","1543688267","33"
"30022554","ali","Halve the butter - 4 tbsp is way too much","1546795580","33"
"21827862","CB","Recipe says 4-6 servings, but my boyfriend and I devoured the whole thing as soon as it came out of the oven.","1506863407","31"
"22558831","Karen","Cooks illustrated had a good recipe for this and said it was best to put it in a cold oven then turn on the heat. It puffs out more. Definitely the way to go.","1506868925","30"
"19599254","Donna McMaster","When I make this for my grandchildren, I heat fresh fruit in a non-stick pan, add to the pancake when it is done, and then top with a good-quality vanilla ice cream. They love having ice cream for breakfast.","1508882398","29"
"29938991","Alisha","I doubled the recipe for company, melted a stick of salted butter in a casserole dish, baked at 425 for 25 minutes and it came out beautifully! (Shew!) Meyer lemons are in season out here. I squeezed the juice of an entire half lemon as soon as I took it out of the oven and sprinkled with confectioners sugar. So. Delicious.  ","1546190230","29"
"19762980","Natalie","I also added some cinnamon & a bit more sugar. the pancake turned out tasty,but too greasy. 2 tablespoons of butter would have been enough","1508884332","24"
"15293643","Karen","A drama in a pan--puffy and golden. It's good with applesauce and yogurt, too. When I made it, it was puffy in less than 20 minutes, and didn't need much extra time at 300°.","1509371084","22"
"30546616","SLSD","I made this a few weeks ago following the recipe.  THEN, I read the notes below.  This morning, I made sure the eggs and milk were at room temperature.  The result of the room temperature ingredients?  A  much fluffier pancake!  I didn't have time to just leave the eggs and milk out to get to room temperature just on their own.  I heated up the milk on the stove--very slightly.  I put the eggs in a bowl of just warm (not too warm) water.  This worked well.  ","1549732654","22"
"19542370","Sandi","I cook fresh fruit (I've tried apple slices and peach slices) in 3 tablespoons of coconut oil while I'm mixing the batter.  I pour the batter over the fruit and pop it in the oven.  No sugar needed as the fruit sweetens the pancake naturally.","1508881521","21"
"23878656","Mary B","I've had celiac for 27 years and this is the most delicious food made with flour that I've had.  I used gluten-free all purpose flour and didn't add the sugar to the batter.  I also omitted the nutmeg and added vanilla instead.  We ate it with blueberries and a little syrup.  What an easy treat!","1506885034","21"
"23997395","Lisa","This works as a savory pancake as well. I omit all but a few pinches of sugar, add a few pinches of salt, put chopped or thin-sliced onion or scallion in the pan, and grate some cheese into the batter.","1508765325","19"
"20612614","Amberlea","I do something very similar:<br/>Heat  2 tablespoons of brown sugar, 2tbsp butter and about quarter cup of rum in a pan. Cook it for a mini the or two. Attached sliced bananas at the very end and stir for a few seconds. Pour over pancakes or icecream.","1508888001","18"
"21538090","Peter","4 tbsp is a lot of butter. It baked and tasted fine with 2.5 tbsp.","1508866708","18"
"29932300","catherine","Added bananas and brown sugar and rum to melted butter before adding batter to do a ""bananas foster Dutch baby""... SO GOOD","1546104639","18"
"18465902","Aanna","Careful with the timing. I made this in my cast iron pan and wandered away from the oven during the initial 20 minute baking. Came back to find the bottom and edges badly burnt.<br/><br/>The unburnt part were good, though!","1508875156","17"

"19549562","Joan Oakland","Made this tonight exactly to the recipe.( Had some whole nutmegs, grated one about 10 strokes for the ""pinch"")  Served it hot out of the oven dusted with powdered sugar. Had some gorgeous ripe peaches, sliced them about an hour before making the Dutch baby. So sweet they didn't need any additional sugar. Served with little all natural breakfast sausages. My tummy is in heaven!!!! Husband still loves me. It is based meal by meal . . .","1508882904","13"
"18466137","Glcc42","Fabulous. Spectacular and delish. I'll use lemon and powder sugar next time. Too much for me. I'll make sure grandkids are over next time I make it.","1508875672","12"
"18691960","Ana","Excellent, simple recipe that yields delicious results BUT way too much butter.  Next time I'll try 2tbs butter instead of 4, it should be plenty.","1508876467","12"
"20068242","James","I followed the directions as listed.  I did let the cast iron skillet preheat with the oven and then added the butter when it was hot.  After it melted I added the batter and popped it back in the oven. <br/><br/>I topped it with some diced honeycrisp apple I saluted in butter, cinnamon and sugar.  <br/><br/>Next time I'll only use 2 tbsp butter and probably add the apple with the batter.","1508885299","12"
"23282652","Condiment queen","So easy. So good. A cautionary note: Watch your baby as it bakes! Mine was golden brown in 15 minutes, 5 minutes faster than the recipe states. Also, this fed just two people in our household.","1506876925","12"
"20076238","VKent","I substituted Pamela's Gluten Free All Purpose Flour. It is just as amazingly great. My son (18) is over the moon. We used strawberry cream cheese and 4-fruit spread as toppings. I won't cook it quite as long at 425, as the gluten free flour seems to scorch just a tad faster.","1508886400","11"
"23968883","Sohini","Cooked exactly as instructed but substitute cashew milk since I don't use dairy regularly and didn't have regular milk on hand. Came our perfect and topped with fresh berries bananas and whipped cream","1508764137","11"
"24096394","Steve","Anything is going to taste great with half a stick of butter in it!  As someone who is looking to eat healthier I'll have to pass on this recipe.<br/>So many recipes I get from the NYT start with a 1/2 pound of pork fat or copious amounts of butter.  How about some healthier cooking options once in a while ?","1508764953","11"
"22575222","Alexi","This was my first time ever making a dutch baby and I will definitely try doing it again - it's so easy. Helpful suggestions from others to use 2 tbsp of butter instead of 4.

"22560589","Julia","Yes, but you will have to play around with the temperatures (making them a little lower) and keep a very close eye on them in your first couple tries to get the timing down. <br/><br/>However, as a long fan of Dutch pancakes, I have to warn you that you're cutting down on the fun. The crispy edges slowly turn into an almost pillow-like souffle that soaks up syrups and sauces like a dream. As a smaller pancake, it's going to be more consistent, like a Yorkshire pudding.","1506868982","8"

I also was generous with the nutmeg and powdered sugar—was delicious and didn’t need any other toppings.   Lastly, before turning the oven down to 300 I opened the oven to let out some hot air.

"118114583","Bogdan","These are highly addictive. Be warned! I find having a properly 425F pre-heated cast iron skillet essential. It doesn’t matter then if your ingredients are room temp or taken from the fridge, the thermal inertia of the skillet will take care of making your Baby reach for the sky. We love the sweet version for breakfast in which I use just a bit of brown sugar, cardamom and a pinch of salt in the batter, then we overload the pancake with berries, sprinkle a little bit of maple syrup and mint.","1651501285","3"

"21118320","Kiko","Made this about 10 times now - it's super easy to make and delicious. I mixed by hand. I made some adjustments: reduced the butter to 2 tablespoons, reduced sugar to 3/4 tablespoon and added some vanilla and cinnamon!","1508858616","2"
"21887674","Cat M","Love that this is so versatile you can use what's on hand and have a lovely surprise each time. Last night I didn't have any milk except for chocolate (for morning coffee). Using a rich chocolate milk in the batter made an unusually tasty treat with sliced pear browned in butter while heating the pan. The recipe is so fast that even if you mess up you can make a replacement very quickly. FYI, I warm the milk slightly in the microwave and it brings other ingredients to room temp.","1506863417","2"

"23409735","Kristin","Made this for one.  One extra large egg, 3T flour, 3T milk, pinch each of salt, sugar and nutmeg whisked together, poured over 1T melted butter in well heated 8"" cast iron skillet and baked for 15 minutes. Puffed up beautifully just like the photo.  Served with defrosted raspberries and fresh strawberries sweetened with a little maple syrup. Delicious but more of a desert for two than a breakfast for one. ","1506878495","2"
"24367767","Richard","I put some very thinly sliced Macintosh apples with some cinnamon and brown sugar into a square pyrex pan with the butter instead of a skillet, when the butter was bubbly and the apples tender added the batter, served with a choice of tart preserves or cinnamon sugar, some canned whipped creme and additional cinnamon for those who wanted it, was wonderful","1507498377","2"
"24889583","TheDoug","Easier than crepes or American pancakes and goes to the same spot. Preheat a cast iron pan with the oven. Melt butter in the pan and follow with room temp batter. Set the table with jam, cheese, and fruit while you wait for it to puff.","1511030169","2"
"24976121","Jennifer G","My cast iron pan is extra large, so I increased the eggs to four and the milk and flour to 2/3 cup. I also added 1/4 tsp salt - I think I'll make it 1/2 next time. I warmed the milk for 30 seconds in the microwave since I didn't have time to bring the eggs to room temperature. It turned out wonderfully puffy and golden. Delicious.","1511788341","2"
"25518620","Gail from Chicago","Video has correct way to cook this, I put the pan in while oven preheated. Once preheated put the butter in allowed it to melt then added mixture, came out perfect.  Topping: try squeezing some lemon on top with a little powdered sugar.","1515689090","2"

"30315288","TV","This is so simple and turns out amazing! It is a lot of butter, but nobody in my family complains when small wells of melted butter are sitting on top of a freshly baked Dutch Baby in the morning! I usually add vanilla bean paste.   We only have one cast iron skillet, so we can only make one Dutch Baby every 20 minutes. They can easily be split, so my kids share one while the second one cooks.","1548361168","2"

"106693490","Rick","I make this in the fashion of the Original Pancake House’s Dutch Garden: Dutch Baby recipe, omit nutmeg, use 1 teaspoon of sugar. I sauté a mix of veggies, whatever is handy, but our favorites are onions, broccoli, pepper and tomato. I dice a few slices of bacon and cook in the skillet. Remove the bacon bits, mixing them with the veg, leaving the fat to cook the pancake. I bake the pancake halfway, then add the veggies & bacon and lots of cheese (Swiss or Gouda are our favorites).","1587769569","2"

"111702284","BG","Followed Mona Lyn Reese’s comment from the “Savory Dutch Baby” NYTC recipe and used ingredient quantities suitable for my 12” (3-4 qt) skillet: 4 Tbsp butter, 4 eggs, 1 cup flour, 1 cup milk. All ingredients were at room temp. Kept the cooking time the same. I’ve made this twice and it’s turned out perfect both times! Watching it puff up in the oven provides entertainment, too!","1614039457","2"

I mix the wet ingredients first and I add the flour last a little at a time as I whisk. I usually add 1tsp of vanilla and 1tsp of lemon zest. You can add blueberries but drop them in the skillet last after you’ve poured the batter in. It then becomes a fruit toad-in-the-hole. I also serve it sautéed apples sometimes.   My recipe uses 3tbsp unsalted butter, and I bake at 400°F for 20 minutes.","1639843523","2"

"117595607","Josh McCool","I have used lots of different dutch baby recipes over the years, but this one is the best I have found so far.  The trick I learned from this recipe that makes a big difference in the outcome is turning down the heat for the last part of the bake; this allows the inside of the dutch baby to cook and solidify without overcooking it or over-browning the outside. Also, the nutmeg is a nice addition!  My suggestions - Add some quality vanilla extract for some extra flavor, and always use good butter","1648583967","2"

"130873179","Nicole","1) If you whisk the eggs with the flour first, before adding milk, it's a LOT easier to create a smooth consistency. 2) Using a pie pan works beautifully and makes for nice serving 3) Apple Pie German Pancakes are a hit at our house - Melt butter in oven, add one large chopped apple with cinnamon and a dash of brown sugar and let cook for 10 minutes, then add batter. Pancake won't puff as much but no one seems to care because it tastes so good.","1706814881","2"
